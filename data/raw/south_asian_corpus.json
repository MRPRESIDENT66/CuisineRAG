This soft and pliable bread accompanies meals, replacing utensils for scooping up sauces, stews, and curries, or with dryer dishes like tandoori chicken.\n\n## Etymology\nThe term \"naan\" comes from Persian nân (نان), a generic word for any kind of bread.\nThe earliest known English use of the term occurs in an 1803 travelogue written by William Tooke. While Tooke and other early sources spelled it \"nan\", the spelling \"naan\" has become predominant since the 1970s.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n### Indian subcontinent\nNaan spread to the Indian subcontinent during the Islamic Delhi Sultanate period. The earliest mention of naan in the region comes from the memoirs of Indo-Persian Sufi poet Amir Khusrau living in India during the 1300s AD. Khusrau mentions two kinds of naan eaten by Muslim nobles; Naan-e-Tunuk and Naan-e-Tanuri. Naan-e-Tunuk was a light or thin bread, while Naan-e-Tanuri was a heavy bread and was baked in the tandoor. During India’s Mughal era in the 1520s, naan was a delicacy that only nobles and royal families enjoyed because of the lengthy process of making leavened bread and because the art of making naan was a revered skill known by few. The Ain-i-Akbari, a record of the third Mughal emperor’s reign, refers to naan being eaten with kebabs or kheema in it. By the 1700s, naan had reached the masses in Mughal cultural centers in South Asia.\n\n### Indonesia\nIn Indonesia, naan is a popular alternative to rice among the Indians, Arabs, Malays, Acehnese and the Minangkabaus, similar though not the same as roti or roti canai which was introduced from Tamils. This dish is known as roti naan or roti nan, and is cooked using Indonesian spices such as garlic.\n\n### Myanmar\nNaan bya (Burmese: နံပြား) in Myanmar is traditionally served at teahouses with tea or coffee as a breakfast item. It is round, soft, and blistered, often buttered, or with creamy pè byouk (boiled chickpeas) cooked with onions spread on top, or dipped with Burmese curry.\n\n### China\nThe Jingzhou style of guokui, a flatbread prepared inside a cylindrical charcoal oven much like a tandoor, has been described as \"Chinese naan\". It is also an integral part of Uyghur cuisine and is known in Chinese as 饢 (náng).\n\n### Japan\nAfter being promoted by Kandagawa Sekizai Shoukou in 1968, which is now the sole domestic manufacturer of tandoors, naan is now widely available in Indian-style curry restaurants in Japan, where naan is typically free-flow. Some restaurants bake ingredients such as cheese, garlic, onions, and potatoes into the naan, or cover it with toppings like a pizza.\n\n### France\nIn France, the classical naan has been revisted with cheese, to create Cheese Naan in Paris in the 1970s.\nThe most likely origin is attributed to André Risser, who, concerned about the French reception of Indian cuisine in 1967, decided to fill naan with cheese spread.\nAnother hypothesis attributes the creation of the variant, in Paris in 1976, to an Indian family from Bombay.\n\n### Elsewhere\nIn 1799, the word naan was introduced into the English language by historian and clergyman William Tooke. Today, naan can be found worldwide in restaurants serving South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine, and it is available in many supermarkets. Fusion cuisine has introduced new dishes that incorporate naan, including naan pizza and naan tacos and even huevos rancheros (an egg dish) served over naan. Naan pizza is a type of pizza where naan is used as the crust instead of the traditional pizza dough. Chefs such as Nigella Lawson, and supermarkets such as Wegmans offer recipes for people to make their own naan pizza at home, though it is certainly not traditional.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n== References ==",

The diet of most Afghans revolves around rice-based dishes, while various forms of naan are consumed with most meals. Tea is generally consumed daily in large quantities, and is a major part of hospitality. The culinary specialties reflect the nation's ethnic and geographic diversity. The national dish of Afghanistan is Kabuli palaw, a rice dish cooked with raisins, carrots, nuts, and lamb or beef.\n\n## Background\nThe cuisine of Afghanistan is halal and uses various herbs and spices including coriander, mint, dill, cumin, cardamom and turmeric as well as locally-grown saffron. Afghan dishes are typically mild in flavor.  \nA variety of rice dishes known locally as 'palao' are prepared with various fruits, nuts and legumes, and combine sweet and sour flavors central to Afghan cuisine. Dumpling and noodle dishes, meat and vegetable stews, legumes, and kebab dishes make up the bulk of Afghan cuisine.\n\n## Staple foods\n\n\n### Rice\nRice is a core staple food in Afghan cuisine and the most important part of any meal. Challow, or white rice cooked with mild spices, is served mainly with qormas (korma: stews or casseroles). Palaw is cooked similarly to challow, but a combination of meat, stock, qorma, and herbs are also mixed in before baking, resulting in the elaborate colors, flavors, and aromas from which the rice got its name. Sometimes caramelized sugar is used to give the rice a rich brown color. Examples of palaw include:\n\nQabeli palao (the national dish) – meat and stock are added, plus a topping of fried raisins, slivered carrots, and pistachios\nZamarod palao – Spinach, dill and sometimes other green herbs are mixed in before the cooking process, hence zamarod, meaning \"emerald\"\nBore palao – lawand is added giving the rice a yellow color\nLandi palao – a traditional meal of rice (with stock made from chicken or mutton that has been salted and dried in the sun)\nBonjan-e-roomi palao – bonjan-e-roomi (tomato qorma) is added during baking giving the rice a red color\nNarenj palao – a sweet elaborate rice dish made with saffron, orange peel, pistachios, almonds, and chicken\nMash palao – a strictly vegetarian sweet-and-sour pilaf baked with mung beans, apricots, and bulgur wheat\nAlbalo palao – a sweet rice dish with sour cherries\n\n### Afghan bread\nAfghan bread is flat and cooked in a tanoor or tandoor (a vertical ground clay oven). The bread is slapped onto a stone wall to cook. Tabakhai is a flatbread cooked on a flat upside-down pan.\n\n## Major dishes\n\n\n### Steamed dumplings\nThere is a wide variety of dumplings. Known under the name khameerbob and often eaten as dumplings, gs, they are rarely served at large gatherings, such as weddings. They are instead served on special occasions at home. \n\nAushak – dumplings filled with a mixture consisting mainly of leeks, topped with either garlic-mint qoroot or a garlic yogurt sauce, sautéed tomatoes, red kidney beans, and a well-seasoned ground-meat mixture. It is a dish associated with Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.\nMantu – steamed dumplings filled with onion and ground beef or lamb, usually topped with a tomato- and yogurt- or qoroot-based sauce and then garnished with dried mint and coriander. The yogurt-based topping is usually a mixture of yogurt, garlic, and split chickpeas. The qoroot-based sauce is made of goat's cheese and also mixed with garlic; a qoroot and yogurt mixture is sometimes used.\n\n### Qormah\nQormah (also spelled \"korma\" or \"qorma\") is an onion- and tomato-based stew or casserole usually served with challow rice. First, onion is caramelized, for a richly colored stew. Then tomato is added, along with a variety of fruits, spices, and vegetables, depending on the recipe. The main ingredient, which can be meat or other vegetables, is added last. There are hundreds of different types of qormahs including:\n\nQormah e gosht (meat qormah) – usually the main qormah served with palaw at gatherings\nQormah e alou bokhara – onion-based using veal or chicken, sour plums, lentils, and cardamom\nQormah e nadroo – onion-based, using lamb meat or veal, yogurt, lotus roots, cilantro, and coriander\nQormah e lawand – onion-based, using chicken, lamb, or beef, plus yogurt, turmeric, and cilantro\nQormah e sabzi – lamb, sautéed spinach, cilantro and other greens with fenugreek; sometimes kidney beans are included\nQormah e shalgham – onion-based using lamb, turnips, and sugar (sweet and sour taste)\n\n### Kabob\nAfghan kabob is most often found in restaurants and at outdoor street vendor stalls. Most of the time, it contains lamb meat. Kabob is made with naan instead of rice. Customers have the option to sprinkle sumac or ghore angoor (dried ground sour grapes) on their kabob. Pieces of fat from the sheep's tail (jijeq) are usually added to the skewers to add extra flavor. Traditional Afghan kabobs are made with onion juice, lemon, yoghurt, black pepper and sometimes saffron for chicken.\n\nOther popular kabobs include the lamb chop, ribs, kofta (ground beef), and chicken.\nChapli kebab, a specialty of eastern Afghanistan, is a patty of minced beef. It is a popular barbecue meal in Afghanistan. It is prepared flat and round and served with naan. The original recipe of chapli kabob dictates a half-meat, half-flour mixture which renders it lighter in taste and less expensive. This type of kabob contains herbs and sometimes chilli.\n\n### Chicken\nAfghan chicken or murgh-e is a classic example of one of the most famous dishes of Afghanistan. Chicken dishes are usually found in restaurants and at outdoor street vendor stalls. Unlike in the Indian cooking style, chicken in Afghan cuisine is often used with the intention that it be halal. Cream, butter, and curd are customary ingredients in all chicken recipes, whether served as an appetizer or a main course.\n\n### Quroot\nQuroot (or qoroot) is a reconstituted dairy product, traditionally a by-product of butter made from sheep's or goat's milk. The residual buttermilk remaining after churning butter is soured further (by keeping it at room temperature for a few days), treated with salt, and then eventually boiled. The precipitated casein is filtered through cheesecloth, pressed in order to remove liquid, and then shaped into balls; the product is thus a hard and very sour cottage cheese. Though it can be eaten raw as a savory snack, it is typically served with cooked Afghan dishes such as aushak, mantu, and kichri qoroot.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n\n## Desserts and snacks\nAs a dessert after a meal, most Afghans generally eat fresh fruit. For snacks, they may drink tea with something sweet like cakes, cookies or pastries. On occasions, they also eat dried fruits which are widely available in every Afghan market. Other typical desserts include the following: \n\nAfghan cake (similar to pound cake, sometimes with real fruit or jelly inside)\nBaklava (pastry)\nBastani\nCream roll (pastry)\nFalooda or Faloodeh\nFirini\nFernea, sometimes spelled feereny, (milk and cornstarch help make this very sweet, similar to rice pudding without the rice)\nKolcha (variety of cookies, baked in clay ovens with charcoal)\nShir- Yakh, a traditional wet ice cream\nSheer khurma, a traditional dessert\nSholeh Zard\nShir Berenj (rice pudding)\n\n## Soups\nShorwa\nShorwa-e-tarkari (meat and vegetable soup)\nPeyawa or eshkana (a soup based on flour, similar to a gravy, but mixed with chopped onion, potatoes, and eggs)\nAush (noodle soup with herbs and beans)\nAush-e serka (vinegar-based flat noodle soup)\n\n## Drinks\n\n\n### Chai\nChai is tea in Afghanistan, which can either be green or black. It is consumed at all times, especially a short time after finishing a meal or with guests during any social gathering. Most people drink green tea with no sugar. Some add cardamom, saffron, or sugar.\nSheer chai (or \"milk tea\") is also consumed but mostly in the morning and on special occasions. It is a type of Kashmiri chai. Many people of Afghanistan also drink masala chai, particularly in cities such as Asadabad, Jalalabad, Khost and Kandahar.\n\n### Doogh\nDoogh (also known by some Afghans as shomleh or shlombeh) is a cold drink made by mixing water with yogurt and then adding fresh or dried mint. Some variations of doogh include the addition of crushed or diced cucumber chunks. It is the second most widely consumed drink in Afghanistan (the first being tea), especially during lunchtime in summer. Doogh can be found at almost every Afghan grocery store and is served in restaurants.\n\n## Sub-cuisines\nWhile Afghans have a common cuisine, certain ethnicities form sub-variations of it.\n\n### Pashtun cuisine\nPashtuns are the largest ethnic group of Afghanistan, constituting about 42% of the country's total population. A major dish in Pashtun culture are rosh (cooked lamb and mutton with no spices) and sohbat, found at traditional gatherings and events. Other major Pashtun dishes include lamb-skewered sajji and chapli kebab. The name dampukht stands for steamed meat, and khaddi kebab is the Afghan shashlik, which is grilled on an open fire, on a spit.\nAlthough it differs between regions, Pashtun cuisine is meat-heavy and often includes caramelized rice. For example, the dish known as bolani in the north and east is often called borogyen in the south and west of Afghanistan.\nCommon summer beverages include shlombeh, a drink consisting of liquid yogurt, mint, and cucumber. Sherbet is an ice-sugared cold drink. Sher yakh is a sweet ice-like product.\n\n### Hazara cuisine\nThe Hazara people in central Afghanistan (in the region of Hazarajat) and western Pakistan (Balochistan province) have their own fare. The Hazaragi cuisine shares some similarities with neighboring regional cuisines, so it is mainly influenced by Central Asian, Persian, and South Asian cooking. However, cooking methods vary in some of the dishes of these neighboring cuisines.\n\n## Dining etiquette\nTraditionally, dinners are served on a tablecloth on the floor, which is called the dastarkhan. Meals are normally eaten with the right hand. After a meal, tea with dessert is served.\n\n## Special occasions\nServing tea and white sugared almonds (called nuql) is customary during Afghan festivals.\n\n## See also\nCulture of Afghanistan\nEconomy of Afghanistan\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nHelen J.

Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa and West Africa each have distinctive dishes, preparation techniques, and consumption modes.\n\n## History\nThe roots of native African cuisine goes back to thousands of years before the Bronze Age in Northeast Africa, when early civilizations began cultivating grains such as barley and wheat. Part of North Africa is in the Fertile Crescent where settled agriculture was practiced by the Ancient Egyptians in this area. Animals such as donkeys and sheep were also domesticated, starting the spread of agriculture to other parts of Africa, notably West Africa. Although most tribes still lived a simple hunter-gather diet.\nArab explorers- Leo Africanus and Ibn Battuta- provided accounts of African food which they encountered on their travels through sub-Saharan Africa. Most European travelers stayed close to coastal areas until the 19th century. Many of their diaries also recorded details on foods and crops. Many staples were introduced later when Africa was colonized by the Europeans. Foods that are now important parts of African cuisine such as maize and potatoes were not common until the 19th century.\nThe influence of African food on Caribbean, Brazilian, American Lowcountry cuisine, and Cajun cuisine from Louisiana is seen in rice dishes and green stews like the Afro-Caribbean efo, duckanoo and callaloo. The vegetable okra, introduced from Africa, is used in classic Louisiana gumbos, and American rice growing in the Carolina. Lowcountry was influenced by West African techniques of rice cultivation and many slaves hailed from the rice-growing regions of West Africa. Lowcountry cuisine is still known for its distinctive rice dishes.\n\n## Central Africa\nCentral Africa expands from the Tibesti Mountains in the north to the vast rainforest basin of the Congo River, the highlands of Kivu and the savannah of Katanga.\nThis region has received the culinary influence of the Swahilis (culture that evolved via the combination of Bantu, Yemeni, Omani and Indian cultures) during the trans-Saharan slave trade. Swahili culinary influences can be found in dishes such as mandazi, pilaf rice, kachumbari, sambusa, and kuku paka.\nCentral African cuisine has also been influenced by the Portuguese, by way of the Kongo and Ndongo Kingdoms. Salt fish was introduced following trade in the late 17th century, and the Kikongo term for salt fish, makayabu, comes from the Portuguese term bacalhau.\nThe Portuguese culinary influence is especially prominent in Angola, Sao Tomé and Equatorial Guinea. Central Africa has also been influenced by the cuisine of the East, West and Southern Africa regions because of their close proximity, e.g. babuté or bobotie is shared with the south, nyama choma with the east and sauce gombo with West Africa.\nIn Central Africa, a variety of crops are grown, including yams, cassava, bananas and plantains, sweet potatoes, and cocoyams. These crops have become staples in the diet of many people in Central Africa. Fufu-like starchy foods are usually made from fermented cassava roots, but they can also be made with plantain, corn maize and yam. Fufu is served buffet-style with grilled meat, fish, stews, greens and piment . A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes, like spinach stew cooked with tomato, peppers, chilies, onions, and peanut butter. Eastern central Africa is also one of the few regions in Africa that uses potatoes as one of its main bases, since potatoes grow easily in the region.\nCassava plants are also consumed as cooked greens. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing chicken, okra, ginger, and other spices. Beef and chicken are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing crocodile, elephant, antelope and warthog meats are also served occasionally.\n\n### Countries\nAngolan cuisine\nCameroonian cuisine\nCuisine of the Central African Republic\nChadian cuisine\nCongolese cuisine\nCuisine of Equatorial Guinea\nGabonese cuisine\nCuisine of São Tomé and Príncipe\n\n## East Africa\nThe cuisine of East Africa varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive meaning that meat products are generally absent. Cattle, sheep, pigs and goats were regarded as a form of currency and a store of wealth. They are not generally consumed as food.\nIn some areas, traditional East Africans consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other Africans are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. Maize (corn) is the basis of ugali', the local version of West and Central Africa's fufu. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In Uganda, steamed green bananas called matoke provide the starch filler of many meals.\nAround 1000 years ago, Omani and Yemeni merchants settled on the Swahili Coast. Middle Eastern influences are especially reflected in the Swahili cuisine of the coast—steamed or cooked rice with spices in Persian style; saffron, cloves, cinnamon and several other spices; and pomegranate juice.\nSeveral centuries later, the British and the Indians came, and both brought with them foods such as Indian spiced vegetable curries, lentil soups, chapattis and a variety of pickles which have influenced various local dishes. Some common ingredients used in this region include oranges, lemons, limes, chilies, capsicum peppers, maize, tomatoes, and strawberries.\nIn the Horn of Africa, the main traditional dishes in Eritrean cuisine and Ethiopian cuisine are tsebhis (stews) served with injera (flatbread made from teff, wheat, or sorghum) and hilbet (paste made from legumes, mainly lentils and fava beans). Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries.\nEritrean and Ethiopian food habits vary regionally. In the highlands, injera is the staple diet and is eaten daily among the Tigrinya. Injera is made out of teff, wheat, barley, sorghum or corn, and resembles a spongy, slightly sour pancake. When eating, diners generally share food from a large tray placed in the center of a low dining table. Many injera are layered on this tray and topped with various spicy stews. Diners then break into the section of injera in front of them, tearing off pieces and dipping them into the stews.\nIn the lowlands, the main dish is akelet, a porridge-like dish made from wheat flour dough. A ladle is used to scoop out the top, which is filled with berbere and butter sauce and surrounded by milk or yoghurt. A small piece of dough is broken and then used to scoop up the sauce.\n\nThe best known Ethiopian/Eritrean cuisine consists of various vegetable or meat side dishes and entrées, usually a wat, or thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread made of teff flour. One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera to scoop up the entrées and side dishes.\nTihlo, prepared from roasted barley flour, is very popular in Amhara, Agame, and Awlaelo (Tigray). Traditional Ethiopian cuisine employs no pork or shellfish of any kind, as they are forbidden in the Jewish and Ethiopian Orthodox Christian faiths. It is also very common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people.\n\nSomali cuisine varies from region to region and consists of an exotic mixture of diverse culinary influences. It is the product of Somalia's rich tradition of trade and commerce. Despite the variety, there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines: all food is served halal. There are therefore no pork dishes, alcohol is not served, nothing that died on its own is eaten, and no blood is incorporated. Qaddo or lunch is often elaborate.\nVarieties of bariis (rice), the most popular being basmati, usually serve as the main dish. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and sage are used to aromatize these different rice dishes. Somalis serve dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, dinner is often served after Tarawih prayers, sometimes as late as 11 pm.\nXalwo (halwo) or halva is a popular confection served during special occasions such as Eid celebrations or wedding receptions. It is made from sugar, cornstarch, cardamom powder, nutmeg powder, and ghee. Peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor. After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using frankincense (lubaan) or incense (cuunsi), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a dabqaad.\nFood and nutrition security in East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan) is a significant issue. The region has been plagued by drought, conflict and economic instability since the 1990s. The current situation is characterized by low levels of food availability and high levels of malnutrition among young children. The solution proposed for this problem is to increase local food production. This would be achieved by increasing agricultural productivity by improving soil fertility and water management, which will help farmers grow more crops per year. This will also help reduce poverty in the region by providing more employment opportunities for local people.\n\n## North Africa\nIn a study of food loss and waste in North Africa, researchers found that the region was wasting about 30% of its food, which is likely to increase as the population continues to grow. This waste occurs for a variety of reasons, including lack of refrigeration and storage facilities. To solve this issue, the people had to get creative with new dishes and ways of storing food. The more we looked, the more we found that people were using all parts of  plants in some way—the leaves, stems, flowers, fruits and seeds. They also used every edible part of animals as well—from fat to bones for making broth or soup.\nNorth Africa lies along the Mediterranean Sea and encompasses within its fold several nations, including Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Egypt. The roots of North African cuisine can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa, particularly in Egypt, where many of the country's dishes and culinary traditions date back to African antiquity.\nOver several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. The Phoenicians of the 1st century brought sausages, while the Carthaginians introduced wheat and its by-product, semolina. The Berbers adapted semolina into couscous, one of the main staple foods. Olives and olive oil were introduced before the arrival of the Romans.\nFrom the 7th century onwards, the Arabs introduced a variety of spices, like saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and cloves, which contributed and influenced the culinary culture of North Africa. The Ottoman Turks brought sweet pastries and other bakery products, and from the New World, North Africa got potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini and chili peppers.\nMost of the North African countries have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan tangia and the Tunisian coucha are both essentially the same dish, a meat stew prepared in an urn and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. In addition, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a tajine dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian tajine is a baked omelette/quiche-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations, from the sophisticated, full-bodied flavors of Moroccan palace cookery to the fiery dishes of Tunisian cuisine and the humbler, simpler cuisines of Egypt and Algeria.\n\n## Southern Africa\nThe cooking of the Southern Africa region (not to be confused with the country of South Africa) is sometimes called \"rainbow cuisine\", as the food in this region is a blend of many cultures: indigenous African societies, European, and Asian. To understand indigenous African cuisine, it is important to understand the various native peoples of southern Africa. The indigenous Africans of Southern Africa were roughly divided into two groups and several subgroups.\nThe largest group consisted of the Bantu-speakers, whose descendants today may identify themselves by various subgroup names such as Ndebele (northern and southern), Shona, Venda, Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi, Sotho, Tswana, Pedi and Tsonga. They arrived in the region around 2,000 years ago, bringing crop cultivation, animal husbandry, and iron toolmaking with them.  Hence the Bantu-speakers grew grain crops extensively and raised cattle, sheep and goats. They also grew and continue to grow pumpkins, beans, and leafy greens as vegetables.\nA smaller group were the primeval residents of the region, the Khoisan, who some archaeologists believe had lived in the region for at least 10,000 years.  Many descendants of the Khoisan people have now been incorporated into the population of South Africa. The Khoisan originally were hunter-gatherers (who came to be known as \"San\" by the Bantu-speakers and as \"bushmen\" by Europeans).  After the arrival of the Bantu-speakers, however, some Khoisan adopted the Bantu-speakers' raising of cattle but did not grow crops.  The Khoisan who raised cattle called themselves \"Khoi-Khoi\" and came to be known by Europeans as \"Hottentots.\"\n\n People were, in other words, defined to some extent by the kinds of food they ate. The Bantu-speakers ate dishes of grain, meat, milk and vegetables, as well as fermented grain and fermented milk products. While the Khoi-Khoi ate meat and milk and the San hunted wild animals and gathered wild tubers and vegetables. In many ways, the daily food of native South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their native African ancestors ate. The Khoisan and Bantu traditionally ate roasted meat, and they also dried meat for later use.\nThe influence of their diet is reflected in the universal Southern African love of barbecue (generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name, a \"braai\") and biltong (dried preserved meat). The traditional beer was ubiquitous in the southern African diet, and the fermentation added additional nutrients to the diet. It was a traditional obligation for any family to be able to offer a visitor copious amounts of beer. Beer brewing was done by women, and the status of a housewife in pre-colonial southern Africa depended significantly on her skill at brewing delicious beer.\n\nMilk was historically one of the most important components of the southern African diet. Cattle were considered a man's most important possession. In order to marry, a man had to compensate his prospective in-laws with a gift of cattle as a dowry for his bride.  A married man was expected to provide a generous supply of milk to his wife and children, along with meat whenever he slaughtered cattle, sheep or goats. Because there was no refrigeration, milk was mostly soured into a kind of yogurt.\nThe young men of the family often took care of the cattle far away from the villages at \"cattle posts,\" and they sent a steady stream of yogurt home on behalf of their fathers. Today, many South Africans of African origin enjoy drinking sour milk products that are sold in the supermarket, comparable to American buttermilk, yogurt, and sour cream.\nOn weekends they will have a \"braai\", and the meal usually consists of \"pap and vleis\", which is maize porridge and grilled meat as has historically been done in the region.\nThe basic ingredients include seafood, meat products (including wild game), poultry, as well as grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits include apples, grapes, mangoes, bananas, papayas, avocado, oranges, peaches and apricots. Desserts may simply be fruit, but there are some more western-style puddings, such as malva pudding, reminiscent of sticky toffee pudding, which was inspired by both British cuisine and Dutch cuisine. Meat products include lamb, and game like venison, ostrich, and impala. The seafood includes crayfish, prawns, tuna, mussels, oysters, calamari, mackerel, and lobster. There are also several types of traditional and modern alcoholic beverages including many European-style beers.\n\n### Notable dishes\nInyama yenhloko\n\n### Countries\nBotswana cuisine\nCuisine of Eswatini\nCuisine of Lesotho\nNamibian cuisine\nSouth African cuisine\nZimbabwe cuisine\nMozambican cuisine\n\n## West Africa\nA typical West African meal is made with starchy items and can contain meat, fish, as well as various spices and herbs. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including fufu, banku, kenkey (originating from Ghana), foutou, couscous, tô, and garri, which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, or cassava, and also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains.\n\nThe staple grain or starch varies between regions and ethnic groups, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and kenkey are maize dough staples, and garri is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry Sahel belt inland. Examples of these include the Senegalese dish thieboudienne also known as benachin or Jollof rice, a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab kabsah.\nSeeds of Guinea pepper (Aframomum melegueta, also called grains of paradise or melegueta pepper), a native West African plant, were used as a spice and even reached Europe, through North African middlemen, during the Middle Ages. Centuries before the influence of the Europeans, West Africans were trading with the Arab world and spices like cinnamon, cloves, and mint were not unknown, therefore becoming part of the local flavorings. Centuries later, the Portuguese, French and British influenced the regional cuisines, but only to a limited extent.\nThe local cuisine and recipes of West Africa continue to remain deeply entrenched in the local customs and traditions, with ingredients like native rice (Oryza glaberrima), rice, fonio, millet, sorghum, Bambara groundnuts and Hausa groundnuts, black-eyed peas, brown beans, and root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, sweet potatoes, and cassava. Cooking techniques include roasting, baking, boiling, frying, mashing, and spicing. A range of sweets and savories are also prepared.\n\nCooking techniques of West Africa are changing.  In the past West Africans ate much less meat and used native oils (palm oil on the coast and shea butter in Sahelian regions). Baobob leaf and numerous local greens were everyday staples during certain times of the year. Today the diet is much heavier in meats, salt, and fats.  Many dishes combine fish and meat, including dried and fermented fish. Flaked and dried fish is often fried in oil, and sometimes cooked in sauce made with hot peppers, onions, tomatoes, various spices (such as soumbala), and water to prepare a highly flavored stew.\nIn some areas beef and mutton are preferred, and goat meat is the dominant red meat. Suya, a popular grilled spicy meat kebab flavored with peanuts and other spices, is sold by street vendors as a snack or evening meal and is typically made with beef or chicken. It is common to have a preponderance of seafood, which as earlier stated, is sometimes also mixed with other meat products. Guinea fowl and chicken eggs are also preferred.\nWith regard to beverages, water has a very strong ritual significance in many West African nations (particularly in dry areas) and water is often the first thing an African host will offer their guest. Palm wine is also a common beverage made from the fermented sap of various types of palm trees and is usually sold in sweet (less-fermented, retaining more of the sap's sugar) or sour (fermented longer, making it stronger and less sweet) varieties. Millet beer is another common beverage (Millet beer, also known as Bantu beer, is an alcoholic beverage made from malted millet.)\n\n### Countries\nBenin cuisine\nBurkinabé cuisine, Burkina Faso\nGhanaian cuisine\nCuisine of Guinea-Bissau\nCuisine of Guinea\nIvorian cuisine\nLiberian cuisine\nMalian cuisine\nMauritanian cuisine\nNigerian cuisine\nCuisine of Niger\nCuisine of Saint Helena\nSenegalese cuisine\nCuisine of Sierra Leone\nTogolese cuisine\nNotable Dishes\nBitter Leaf Soup\nThe exact origins of Bitter Leaf soup appear to be unknown thought it is known to have been prepared and eaten for hundreds of years. The dish traditionally consists of fish, meat (usually beef), bitter leaves, palm oil, and an array of spices and seasonings. Shellfish such as shrimp or crayfish are often used alongside fish in the preparation of Bitter Leaf Soup. Due to the bitterness of bitter leaf, the bitter leaf is washed thoroughly to diminish the bitterness before being cooked with the rest of the ingredients. It is widely consumed in West Africa, especially Nigeria where it is associated with the Igbo people and referred to as Ofe Onugbu.\nThe Bitter Leaf itself is known scientifically as Vernonia amygdalina and is native to Sub-Saharan Africa. The bitter taste comes from the alkaloids contained within the plant.\n\n## See also\nAfroFoodtv.com\nList of African dishes\nCuisine of Seychelles\nTiep\nSwallow\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nMcCann, James C.

    "text": "# Andhra cuisine\n\nAndhra cuisine is the traditional culinary style of the Telugu people, who are native to the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is generally known for its tangy, hot, and spicy taste.\n\n## Regional variations\nThe regions of Coastal Andhra (including Uttarandhra and Dakshinandhra), and Rayalaseema all produce distinctive variations of the Telugu cuisine. Rice is the staple in the irrigated regions of Andhra and Rayalaseema. Ragi (రాగి) is also popular in Rayalaseema and Palnadu. The curries, snacks, and sweets produced in these areas vary in both name and method of preparation from region to region.\nAndhra Pradesh is the leading producer of red chili and rice in India. The concentration of red chili production in Andhra Pradesh has led to the liberal use of spices in Andhra cuisine. Vegetarian dishes, as well as meat, and seafood in coastal areas, feature prominently. Tomato pappu, gongura, and tamarind are widely used for cooking curries. Spicy and hot varieties of pickles are also an important part of Andhra cuisine, including avakaya (ఆవకాయ). \"Deltaic\" cuisine from Guntur in Coastal Andhra is known as the spiciest variety of Andhra cuisine, primarily because of the use of red chilis traditionally grown in the region.\nThe eating habits of Hindu royals and Brahmins have historically had a heavy influence on Andhra cuisine. Andhra Pradesh's proximity to Western, Central, and Eastern India influenced the diversity of those border regions' cuisine as well, as the Telugu-speaking population spread into neighboring states. Different communities have developed their own variations, and rural areas still follow centuries-old cooking methods and recipes.\n\n### Coastal Andhra\nCoastal Andhra is dominated by the Krishna and Godavari river delta regions and is adjacent to the Bay of Bengal. This proximity to water has led to rice, lentils, and seafood becoming dietary staples in the region. Andhra cuisine has its own variations, but dishes are predominantly rice-based. The Nellore region in the south has its own unique recipes, markedly different from those in Uttarandhra. Ulava charu (ఉలవచారు) is a soup made from horse gram, and bommidala pulusu (బొమ్మిడాల పులుసు) is a seafood stew that is considered a specialty of Andhra Pradesh. Andhra cuisine is prevalent in restaurants all over Andhra Pradesh, as well as in cities like Bangalore, Chennai, and New Delhi.\nThe Uttarandhra region is composed of the northeastern districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, and Visakhapatnam in Coastal Andhra. While Visakhapatnam district has a cuisine closer in character to the rest of Andhra's districts, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam cuisine shares less in common with other Andhra regional cuisines. The food of the Uttarandhra region is often sweeter than in other regions of Andhra Pradesh. Lentils are often cooked in jaggery, a dish referred to as bellam pappu (బెల్లం పప్పు) and are usually served with butter and steamed rice.\nVegetables are often cooked in a gravy of menthi kura (మెంతి కూర) (fenugreek seed paste), avapettina kura (ఆవపెట్టిన కూర) (mustard seed paste), or nuvvugunda kura (నువ్వుగుండ కూర) (sesame paste). Ullikaram (ఉల్లికారం) is another popular dish in which vegetables or corn seeds are flavored with shallots or onion paste.\nPoori (పూరి) and patoli are popular breakfast or festival dishes. Patoli is composed of soaked split black chickpeas (senagapappu (శనగపప్పు) or chana dal) ground to a coarse paste and seasoned with coriander seeds, onions, and sometimes cluster beans (goruchikkudukaya) (గోరుచిక్కుడుకాయ). Upma or uppindi (ఉప్పిండి) coarsely broken rice steamed with vegetables and seeds. This dish is eaten on feast days, when people fast during the day and eat at night. Attu (అట్టు) also called dosa (దోశ) is a standard breakfast in Andhra Pradesh, which may also include coconut or tomato chutneys. Idli (ఇడ్లీ), also known as iddena (ఇడ్డెన), is also very common. Karam podi (కారం పొడి) is a popular curry powder that is served with idli, dosa and upma.\nInguva charu (ఇంగువ చారు) is a sweet-and-sour stew made with tamarind and hing. It can be eaten with rice or uppupindi. Bellam pulusu (బెల్లం పులుసు) is another flavorful, thick, sweet stew made out of rice flour, jaggery, corn cobs, and whole shallots.\nThe pickles used in Uttarandhra differ from those of other regions of Andhra Pradesh. Avakaya (ఆవకాయ) is a mango pickle which is part of a standard Andhra meal. Pieces of mango are coated with mustard powder, red pepper powder, and salt, then sun-dried, and finally soaked in sesame oil to give the pickle extended shelf life. The result of this process is a darker hue and a sweeter taste than other pickles. This method helps preserve Uttarandhra pickles better amidst the high moisture from the Bay of Bengal coast.\n\n### Rayalaseema\nRayalaseema, in the south of Andhra Pradesh, is well-known for the spiciness of its cuisine due to the liberal use of chili powder in almost every dish. Naatu kodi pulusu (నాటు కోడి పులుసు), a spicy country chicken stew, is a classic and highly popular dish in this region. Seema karam (సీమ కారం) is a dish unique to this region. Some of the main courses include rice, jonna (జొన్న) (jowar), ragi roti (రాగి రోటి) with neyyi (నెయ్యి), and raagi sangati (రాగి సంగటి), usually served with spinach or pulusu. Uggani (ఉగ్గాని) is a dish unique to Rayalaseema, especially Ananthapur, Kurnool, and Kadapa districts, as well as in Karnataka, where it is called oggane (ಒಗ್ಗಣೆ). It is made with boiled paddycorn and is generally yellowish in color due to heavy use of turmeric powder. It is usually served with mirapakaya bajji (మిరపకాయ బజ్జి) (chili \"bajji\"). Uggani bajji (ఉగ్గాని బజ్జి) served primarily as a breakfast dish, but can be eaten as a snack too. It is spicy and a signature dish of Rayalaseema and Eastern Karnataka.\nSweeter dishes of Rayalaseema include ariselu (అరిసెలు) (rice-based vada with jaggery), pakam undalu (పాకం ఉండలు) (a mixture of steamed rice flour, ground nuts, and jaggery), borugu undalu (బొరుగు ఉండలు) (a sweet made of jowar and jaggery), and rava laddoo (రవ్వ లడ్డూ). Masala borugulu (మసాలా బొరుగులు), and ponganaalu (పొంగణాలు) (wet rice flour fried in oil, with carrot, onion, and chilis) are other savory specialties from the region.\n\n## Breakfast\nA typical Andhra breakfast consists of a few of the items listed below. Usually it consists of idli; garelu, also known as vada, deep-fried lentil dough;  or minapattu, also known as dosa, a rice- and lentil-based pancake or crepe. Tea, coffee with milk, or simply milk often accompany these dishes. The most common dishes consumed for breakfast are:\n\nIdli, urad dal and steamed rice cakes, often eaten with freshly made chutney or with neyyi added and sprinkled with karrap podi (chili dal powder) or chutney and sambar\n\nAndhra dosa, a rice- and urad dal-based crepe eaten with chutney and sambar\nMinapattu, a rice- and lentil-based crepe, served with chutney and sambar\nPesarattu, a green gram-based crepe. It is usually served with ginger chutney. Sometimes pesarattu is filled with upma,  in which case it is known as upma pesarattu.\nDibba attu, a deep-fried dosa made with idli batter\nAtukula dosa, a dosa made from atukulu, also known as poha.\nRava dosa or suji dosa, a dosa made with sooji dough with chili, coriander leaves, onion, and pepper.\n\nAndhra upma\nGodhuma uppindi, upma made from broken wheat flour\nPesarpindi uppindi, a dry porridge made of green gram flour; commonly served with yoghurt or mango-jaggery pickle\nPulusu uppindi, a dry porridge made with rice flour, peanuts, and tamarind extract, and commonly served with yoghurt or mango-jaggery pickle\nBeeyam rava pesara pappu, literally translated as 'made with broken rice and hulled green gram'; commonly served with yoghurt or mango-jaggery pickle\nVaripindi uppindi, a dry porridge made with rice flour and hulled green gram; commonly served with yoghurt or mango-jaggery pickle\nUppudu pindi or uppindi, also known as upma, a porridge made from broken sooji flour, ghee, and vegetables. It is commonly served with buttermilk or a spicy-savoury powder made from pulses.\nSaggubiyyam (sago) upma, an upma made from sago (saboodana)\nSemiya upma, an upma made with vermicelli\n\nVada\nGarelu, a deep-fried lentil-based doughnut, or sometimes a deep-fried dal mixture\nPunukulu or punugulu, also known as bonda, a deep-fried dish made from idli and dosa batter\nGunta punugulu, made from rice and dal batter\nSaggubiyyam punugulu, vada made from sago (saboodana)\nMung dal punugulu, or bonda, a deep-fried dish made from idli and dosa batter\nThapala chekkalu, a deep-fried rice and dal-based flat vada with onions, curry leaves, and chili\nAtukulu or poha\nAtukulu (also known as poha in the northern states), moist rice flakes sautéed in oil\nAtukula dosa, dosa made from atukulu poha\nAtukula upma, upma with sooji replaced with atukulu\nBread and roti\nNokulu annam, made of jowar and jaggery\nChapati, baked flattened wheat dough, served with dal or chutney.\nPuri, wheat dough deep-fried in cooking oil. Served with potato bajji or chutney. Technically a north Indian dish, but widely available in all Telugu restaurants.\n\n## Lunch and dinner\nGreat effort is put into preparing lunch and dinner in many Telugu households. In most urban households, the food is served on stainless steel or porcelain plates, while in traditional and rural households, the food may be served on a banana leaf. The banana leaf is often used during festivals, special occasions, and for guests. Many middle-budget restaurants in smaller towns also use banana leaves for serving food. At times, a vistaraaku (a larger plate made of several leaves sewn together) is used. Sun-dried banana leaves have also traditionally been used to package food for personal use on long journeys.\nA complete vegetarian Andhra meal typically consists of rice served with ghee, pulihora, chapati or puri, pappu (lentils), sambar, chaaru (rasam), fried and wet curries, appadam (papadum), odiyalu, chutney, pachadi, avakaya, yoghurt and a sweet for dessert. In general, food from the Vijayawada-Guntur region contains more chili and spices than food from the rest of Andhra Pradesh. Rice is considered the main dish and everything else is considered a side dish.\n\n## Main course types\nKoora (కూర)— a generic word for a curry. Koora dishes are named for the ingredients used and the method of preparation. There is also iguru(ఇగురు) which is a type of curry where most of the moisture evaporates, leaving mainly the cooking oil. Additional methods include:\n\nVepudu(వేపుడు)(fry): crispy fried vegetables or sometimes meats, typically including prawns(రొయ్యలు), okra (బెండకాయ), ivy gourd (దొండకాయ), potato (బంగాళాదుంప /ఉర్లగడ్డ), colocasia (చామదుంప), and several additional local vegetables.\nPappu koora(పప్పు కూర) (lentil-based dish): boiled vegetables stir-fried with a small amount of half-cooked lentils (dal).\nPodi(పొడి) (powdered dal-based condiment or seasoning): mixed with rice and a spoonful of ghee or sesame oil.\nGujju(గుజ్జు) (gravy): a tomato or coriander seed base into which is added into brinjal (గుత్తి వంకాయ), okra, etc.\nPulusu(పులుసు) (sour paste or gravy)\nPulusu koora/Aava petti koora (stew): boiled vegetables or meats cooked in tamarind sauce and mustard paste. Some varieties include snake gourd (పొట్లకాయ), bottle gourd (సొరకాయ/ఆనపకాయ), okra, pumpkin (గుమ్మడికాయ), country chicken (నాటుకోడి).\nKaaram petti koora(కారం పెట్టి కూర)/Kaaram podi koora (literally, \"dish with curry powder added\"): sautéed vegetables cooked with curry powder or paste, served as a solid mass. The vegetables can be stuffed with curry powder or paste and are usually cooked whole.\nPappucharu(పప్పుచారు) (thick dal broth) or charu\nCharu(చారు) a.k.a. rasam (sour and spicy soup)\nOoragaya(ఊరగాయ) (pickle, similar to పచ్చడి but with a much longer shelf life): avakaya(mango and mustard powder), gongura, nimmakaya(lime), etc.\nPachadi(పచ్చడి) (pasty/saucy condiment or chutney): kobbari (coconut), tomato, gongura, dosakaya, gummadikaya, and allam (ginger).\nOther gravy-based curries are usually made with vegetables cooked in tomato sauce and onion with coriander and cumin powder.\n\n### Pappu (dal)\nPappu (dal/lentils) dishes include toor daal (kandi pappu) and moong daal (pesara pappu), which are usually cooked with a vegetable or other green. No masala is added to the dal. In some areas, garlic and onion are included in the seasoning, while in others asafetida (hing/inguva) is used. Kandi pappu is often cooked with leafy vegetables such as palakura (spinach), gongura, malabar spinach, and other fruits and vegetables such as tomato, mango, or bottle gourd.  Sometimes the cooked version of the dal is replaced with a roasted and ground version, like kandi pachadi (roasted toor daal ground with red chilis), or pesara pachadi (soaked moong daal ground with red or green chilis).\nA very popular combination in Andhra is mudda pappu (ముద్ద పప్పు) (plain toor dal cooked with salt) and avakaya.\n\n### Pulusu\nPulusu (meaning sour) is a curry-like stew that is typically sour and cooked with tamarind paste. Other common bases include tomatoes or mangoes. The mixture can be flavored with mustard, chilis, curry leaves, jaggery, onions, or fenugreek. Fish, chicken, and eggs are typical meat additions. Pachi pulusu is an unheated version of pulusu, typically made of mangoes or tamarind, and eaten during the warmer months.\n\nMajjiga pulusu (మజ్జిగ పులుసు): sour buttermilk boiled with channa dal and coconut paste\nMenthi challa/menthi majjiga: sour buttermilk seasoned with ginger or green chili paste and menthi (fenugreek) seeds, then fried in oil\nMukkala pulusu or Dappalam (ముక్కల పులుసు or దప్పళం): pulusu made with aanapakaya(bottle gourd) and other vegetables\nChammagadda pulusu (చామగడ్డ పులుసు): pulusu made with colocasia\nKanda pulusu (కంద పులుసు): pulusu made with yam\nKanda bachali pulusu: pulusu made with yam and Malabar Spinach\nGangabayala kura pulusu: pulusu made with purslane\nbendakaya pulusu: pulusu made with okra (Ladies Finger)\nsorakaya pulusu (సొరకాయ పులుసు): pulusu made with Bottle gourd\nPerugu (పెరుగు)(curd): the last dish of the meal, normally eaten along with pachadi or pickles\n\n### Pickles\nPachadi and ooragaya are two broad categories of pickle that are eaten with rice. Pachadi is the Telugu version of chutney, typically made of vegetables/greens/lentils and roasted green or red chilis, using tamarind and sometimes curds as a base. It is prepared fresh and must be consumed within two days due to having a short shelf life. Ooragaya is prepared in massive amounts each season. Preparation includes using large amounts of chili powder, as well as menthi (fenugreek) powder, mustard powder, and groundnut (peanut) oil or sesame or mustard oil. It is either consumed on its own, mixed with rice, or as a side dish with pappu/koora.\n\n### Biryani and pulao\nWhile the aforementioned main course types are prevalent in home cooking, biryanis and pulaos are a common entrée at Telugu restaurants. \nCommon bases for vegetarian biryanis and pulaos include jackfruit (పనసపండు), mushroom (పుట్టగొడుగు), brinjals stuffed with spicy gravy (గుత్తి వంకాయ), green chili (పచ్చిమిరపకాయ), red chili (పండుమిరపకాయ), mango pickle (ఆవకాయ), horsegram broth (ఉలవచారు), gongura (గోంగూర), eggs (గుడ్లు) and more.\nCommon bases for nonveg biryanis and pulaos include chicken, quails, chevon, lamb/mutton, fish, prawns and crab.\n\n## Vegetarian dishes\n\n\n### Meal presentation\nPappu (dal/lentils) and kooralu (curries) are placed to the right of the diner, while spiced pickles, pachadi (chutney/raita), a saucy condiment with dahi (yogurt), vegetables, pappulu podi (dal and dry red chili-based powdered condiment), and neyyi (ghee) are placed to the left. On some occasions, special items such as pulihora (tamarind or lemon rice) and garelu (vada) are placed at the top right. A large scoop of annam (plain white rice) is placed in the middle. Small amounts of neyyi are added on the rice. Avakaya (mango pickle) and gongura (roselle leaf pickle) are often served with the meal.\n\n### Courses and servings\nRice is the main dish, eaten by mixing with the side dishes using the right hand, and the primary source of carbohydrates. Spiced pickles, pachadi, podi, and papadum (appadam) are typical side dishes.\nA meal traditionally starts with modhati muddha (first bite), an appetizer of spiced pickle followed by a pappu (dal) dish, which can be made with vegetables added or eaten plain with a pickle. This constitutes the main source of protein for vegetarians. This is followed by a couple of koora varieties, which provide vitamins and minerals. A pappu or rasam (Telugu: charu), usually kadi, is the third course. The fourth course of the meal is either a perugu (curd or yoghurt) or majjiga (buttermilk) accompanied by a spicy pickle or other condiments.\nAfter the meal, paan or somph (areca nut/betel on pan leaf) is traditionally offered. On festival days or other auspicious occasions, a sweet, usually paravannam, is served with the meal, which is usually eaten first.\n\n## Non-vegetarian dishes\nWhile there are a plethora of vegetarian dishes in the Telugu cuisine, a vast majority of Telugus (over 98 percent in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) also consume non-vegetarian food.\nBoth Andhra Pradesh and Telangana also lead in per capita meat consumption within India. Per capita meat consumption has surged by 40% between 2018-2019 and 2024-2025 in both Telugu states. Per capita meat consumption (excluding seafood) reached 21.33 kg and 28.78 kg in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, respectively, in 2024 compared to a national average of 7.5 kilograms.\n\n### Meats\nThe states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana produce abundant aquatic foods and have an established livestock industry.\n\n### Popular meat dishes\nHyderabadi biryani and palaav, or \"Andhra biryani\", are popular dishes within the region. Royyala palav, made with shrimp, is considered a delicacy in coastal Andhra Pradesh. Mutton biryani and mixed biryani (chicken, mutton, and shrimp) are other popular biryani dishes, generally available in restaurants. There are many local variations as well, such as kaaja biryani, kunda biryani (pot biryani), avakaya biryani, ulavacharu biryani, and panasa biryani.\nKodi (chicken) koora and mutton koora are two popular meat dishes, often made with a range of spices and condiments. The base usually consists of onions, tomato, coriander, tamarind, and coconut. These are mixed with steamed rice on the plate during the meal. Pepper is also used on fried meat dishes. Popular dishes commonly served in Andhra-style restaurants include the spicy Andhra chili chicken, chicken roast, and mutton pepper fry. For seafood dishes, a tamarind base is generally used. Shrimp and prawns are widely available for use in cuisine, due to the state's extensive shrimp farming industry.\nOther common meat dishes include:\n\nTalakaya pulusu (తలకాయ పులుసు) and medadu vepudu (మెదడు వేపుడు): Talakaya pulusu is a sour and spicy meat stew with bold flavours, made with chunks of charred goat or sheep head, coriander, tamarind and spices. It is a soupier and sourer version of talakaya kura. The brain of the animal is typically not included in the stew and instead cooked separately into a tender spicy fry known as medadu vepudu which often accompanies talakaya pulusu as a side dish.\nChepala pulusu (చేపల పులుసు): a fish curry seasoned with freshly ground spices and tamarind juice.\nEndu chepala vankaya (ఎండు చేపల వంకాయ): a flavourful dry fish curry cooked with brinjal.\nGongura Endu Royyalu (గోంగూర ఎండు రొయ్యలు): a curry made with gongura leaves, sun-dried prawns and various spices. Part of the appeal of using sun-dried prawns as opposed to fresh ones is that they have minimal odor.\nGongura Mamsam (గోంగూర మాంసం): spicy and sour curry made with tender goat or sheep pieces cooked in a curry of gongura (roselle leaves) and freshly-ground green chili paste.\nGudla pulusu (కోడి గుడ్ల పులుసు): egg curry sprinkled with chopped onions, green chilis, and coriander.\nNatukodi Pulusu (నాటుకోడి పులుసు): A spicy savory country chicken curry/stew originating from the Rayalaseema region. This is often paired with ragi sangati.\nVatti Tunakalu (వట్టి తునకలు): Also known as endu mukkalu (ఎండు ముక్కలు) (lit. “Sun-dried pieces”). To make this traditional jerky, raw meat is first cut into small chunks. Then, these chunks are coated in seasoning such as salt, turmeric, chili powder and ginger-garlic paste and left out in the sunlight for around a week. Once they harden, they can be stored for up to a year in an airtight container or cooked into a curry. Typically, chevon or mutton is used but some use beef or buff instead.\nDoopudu Potu Pulao (దూపుడు పోతు పులావ్): This pulao dish originates from the Bhimavaram region of Andhra Pradesh and it’s also known as Doopudu Gorre Pulao (దూపుడు గొర్రె పులావ్). First, a ram or sometimes male goat is charred with the skin left on to impart a distinct smokey flavor. Then, the meat is cubed and these cubes are cooked with gravy. Later, it’s added to the rice which was cooked separately. Typically, Chitti Mutyalu rice is used.\nSorapittu (సొరపిట్టు): A dry fry made with spices and minced shark meat.\nMiryala Mamsam Vepudu (మిర్యాల మాంసం వేపుడు): This crispy spicy roast is a popular starter in many Telugu restaurants, and it is made by frying mostly boneless chunks of goat or sheep in several spices with pepper being the dominant one.\nBongu Kodi (బొంగు కోడి): Bongu Kodi (lit. “Bamboo Chicken”) is a unique dish that originates from the Araku Valley region of Andhra Pradesh. First, chicken is marinated in spices and set aside for half an hour. Then, the chicken is stuffed into hollow tubes fashioned from bamboo stalks and the ends of the tube are sealed shut with banana leaves. Next, the bamboo stalks are placed on firewood until all the moisture in the bamboo has evaporated. Once it cools down, the chicken is served. What makes this dish special is that no cooking oil or water is necessary as the moisture in the bamboo itself is sufficient to cook the chicken while imparting a rich smoky flavor.\nThese dishes are usually served with steamed rice, Thalimpu annam (basmati rice cooked with aromatic seasoning), sajja roti (millet flatbread), or jonna roti (jowar flatbread).\nNon-vegetarian snacks include kodi pakodi (chicken pakora), chicken 65, peetha pakodi (crab pakodi), chepa vepudu (fish fry), royyala vepudu (shrimp fry), and chicken lollipop.\nBhimavaram town in West Godavari district is famous for its unique non-vegetarian pickles, such as chicken, shrimp, and fish pickles.\n\n## Snacks\nSome common Telugu snacks include:\nUpma (ఉప్మా)\nBoondi (బూంది)\nKaarappoosa (కారప్పూస)\nPonganalu (పొంగనాలు)\nBajji and  bondaalu or punukulu (బజ్జి, బోండాలు or పునుకులు), stuffed with spices, dipped in chickpea batter and fried; served with a spicy dip (allam pachadi).

Some centuries-old cooking practices can still be observed, particularly the use of mud pots, but this practice is being replaced by the use of steel utensils in recent decades. Traditional recipes have largely been influenced by what was grown and available locally earlier in history. In the drier districts, jowar (sorghum), bajra (millet) and ragi are still in use, while eating rice is seen as a symbol of prosperity. In the Delta and coastal districts, rice plays a major role in the cuisine.\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

During the festival of Chhath, thekua, a sweet dish made of ghee, jaggery, and whole-meal flour, flavoured with aniseed, is made.\n\n## Bihari thali\nAs the seasons change so does the Bihari thali, every 3–4 months. The constants are rice, roti, achar, chatni, dals and milk products, with some variation.\nFor the frying and tempering (chhounkna / tadka) of certain vegetable dishes, Bihari cuisine makes use of vegetable oil or mustard oil and panch phoron — literally the \"five spices\": fennel seed (saunf), black mustard seed (sarson), fenugreek seed (methi), cumin seed (jeera) and nigella seed (kalonji or mangraeel). There is a lot of light frying (bhoonjnaa) in Bihari cuisine.\nOne remarkable tradition is \"smoked food\", referring to the use of smoked red chilli to infuse a strong aroma in food.

The food is tailor-made for Bhojpuri lifestyle in which the rural folk expend many calories in the fields.\nMaithil cuisine also known as Mithila cuisine, is a part of Indian and Nepalese cuisine. It is the traditional cooking style of Maithils residing in the Mithila region of India and Nepal.

Forms of kebabs, mutton preparations and dishes prepared from various fowl and birds have a distinctive flavor. Biharis are quite famous for their Bihari kebabs, another typical Bihari non-vegetarian dish. This dish was traditionally made from mutton and is eaten with roti, paratha or boiled rice. The region of Champaran is famous for a grilled mutton dish called taash. Recently, in fast food restaurants, Bihari kebabs are also sold as Bihari kebab rolls, which are essentially kebabs wrapped up in a paratha.\n\nChamparan meat\nPrawns\nMutton biryani\nBihari kebab\nChicken tandoori\n\n## Snacks\nChurra - Beaten rice, served with a coat of creamy curd and sugar or jaggery.

Anglo-Indian food arrived in Britain by 1747, with a recipe for \"a Currey the Indian Way\" in Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy.\nAnglo-Indian cuisine was documented in detail by the English army officer Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert, writing as \"Wyvern\" in 1878. Many of its usages are described in the 1886 Anglo-Indian dictionary, Hobson-Jobson. Definitions vary somewhat; this article follows The Oxford Companion to Food in distinguishing colonial era Anglo-Indian cuisine from post-war British cuisine influenced by the style of dishes served in Indian restaurants.\n\n## History\nDuring the British presence  in India, between 1612 and 1947, cooks began adapting Indian dishes for British palates and creating Anglo-Indian cuisine, with dishes such as kedgeree (by 1790) and mulligatawny soup. As Anglo-Indian cuisine grew in popularity in Britain, the desire for authentic Indian delicacies grew. The first Indian restaurant in England, the Hindoostane Coffee House, opened in London around 1810, offering Indian ambience and curries as well as a hookah-smoking room. As described in The Epicure's Almanack in 1815, \"All the dishes were dressed with curry powder, rice, Cayenne, and the best spices of Arabia\". The founder, Sake Dean Mohomed, stated that the ingredients for the curries as well as the herbs for smoking were authentically Indian. \nThe British East India Company arrived in India in 1600, developing into a large and established organisation. By 1760, men were returning home from India with money and a taste for Indian food. In 1784, a listing in the Morning Herald and Daily Advertiser promoted ready-mix curry powder to be used in Indian-style dishes. The Anglo-Indian term \"curry\" is derived from the Tamil word \"kari\" meaning a spiced sauce poured over rice, its meaning adapted to denote any spicy Indian dish in a thick sauce.\n\nMany handwritten cookbooks including Indian-style dishes were created by British women in the late 18th century.  Hannah Glasse's 1747 book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy included the recipe \"To make a Currey the Indian Way\". Clarissa Dickson-Wright commented that the spices in the recipe did not resemble those of a modern curry, but the dish had a good flavour.\nAnglo-Indian cuisine was documented in practical detail by the English colonel Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert, writing his Culinary Jottings for Madras as \"Wyvern\" in 1878. Many of its usages are described in what Alan Davidson calls the \"wonderful\" 1886 Anglo-Indian dictionary, Hobson-Jobson. The Veeraswamy restaurant opened in London (in Regent Street) in 1926; it originally served Anglo-Indian food, but as regional Indian food became popular in Britain it switched to serving dishes from Punjab and other regions. \nMore recently, the cuisine has been analysed by Jennifer Brennan in 1990 and David Burton in 1993. \nA minority mixed race Anglo-Indian community and its cuisine have survived in India into the 21st century, though the cuisine may be in decline as younger people are no longer learning the recipes.\n\n## Dishes\nAmong colonial era Anglo-Indian creations are kedgeree, a range of curries, and mulligatawny curry soup, eaten with Indian accompaniments such as Bombay duck, chutneys, pickles, and poppadoms. They freely drew on British, Dutch, French, and Portuguese cuisines as well as Indian recipes.\nAnglo-Indians in independent India cook a range of dishes from their traditional cuisine, including pork dishes such as pork chops, pork bhoonie, and the Goan pork assado. They adopted the British custom of adding side dishes to a dinner; these could include recipes like coq au vin, roast duck with orange sauce, and pepper steak. They welcome friends with tea, which may be served with British accompaniments like sandwiches, buns, and cake, and with Indian snacks like pakoras and samosas. The spices they use are the same as those used in Indian cuisine.\n\n### Soups\nMulligatawny soup was based on molo tunny, a watery broth of tamarind with chillies or black pepper. To this was added a small amount of vegetables, rice, and meat. It became extremely popular, representing a British idea of soup combined with an Indian recipe. It was supposedly created in Madras, but became ubiquitous across British India.\n\n### Main dishes\nKedgeree derived from the simple Indian rice and lentil dish khichari. The Anglo-Indian version added garnishes of hard-boiled egg, fish, and fried onions; the British version used smoked haddock as the fish, and dropped the lentils. \nAnglo-Indian curries derived from Indian dishes by a process of change and simplification to meet their taste. Korma or quorema, for example, was adapted from the quarama of Lucknow by leaving out the cream and reducing the amounts of ghee, spices, and yoghurt; these were replaced by the usual Anglo-Indian spice mix of pepper, coriander, and ginger. \nPish pash was defined by Hobson-Jobson as \"a slop of rice-soup with small pieces of meat in it, much used in the Anglo-Indian nursery\". The term was first recorded by Augustus Prinsep in the mid 19th century. The name may derive from the Persian pash-pash, from pashidan, to break. A version of the dish, using rabbit meat, is given in The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie of 1909.\n\n### Spices for curries in India and Britain\nAnglo-Indian cooks created what they called curry by selecting elements of Indian dishes from all over British India. Collingham describes their taste as \"eclectic\", \"pan-Indian\", \"lacking sophistication\",  and forming a \"coherent repertoire\". She notes especially their \"passion for garnishes\", which they borrowed from multiple traditions: chopped hard-boiled eggs from Persian cuisine; lemon pickles from Punjab; pappadoms, dried coconut, and raw onions from South India; and pieces of fried bacon. \nTheir Indian cooks ground spices afresh for each dish, but the Anglo-Indians created recipes for curry powders, different mixtures of spices. Ready-ground curry powder became available commercially in Britain by 1784, differentiating British from Anglo-Indian curries. The basic approach to curry was to grind spices with garlic and onion, mix them to a paste with ghee (clarified butter), and simmer this with the meat. As this recipe returned to Britain, the fresh spices were replaced by curry powder, and the ghee with butter. Lizzie Collingham writes that variations were created with simple additions, such as of chutney and pickles to form \"Bengal\" curry, or grated coconut to make \"Melay\" curry. \nIn her 1895 book Anglo-Indian Cooking at Home, Henrietta Hervey described how to make three curry powders, which she called \"Madras\", \"Bombay\", and \"Bengal\". The \"Madras\" powder recipe called for coriander, saffron, chilli, mustard seed, pepper, and cumin, among other ingredients. The \"Bombay\" recipe used coriander, cummin, turmeric, mustard seed, pepper, chillies, and a little fenugreek. The \"Bengal\" mixture consisted mainly of coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, ginger, black pepper, and chilli. For cooks in England, Hervey suggested the commercial Crosse & Blackwell mixture, which she called \"the nearest approach to the real article\", but \"a pis aller [a desperate measure] at the best\". Hervey's recipe for \"Country Captain\" chicken curry for a British audience consisted of a chicken cut into joints, dusted with curry powder, and fried with onions; Brown's recipe for the modern Anglo-Indian version of the dish calls for chillies, ginger, and black pepper in place of the curry powder.\nChutney, one of the few Indian dishes—alongside curry—that has had a lasting influence on English cuisine according to The Oxford Companion to Food, is a cooked and sweetened condiment of fruit, nuts or vegetables. It borrows from a tradition of jam-making where sour fruit and sugar are combined, the sour note being provided by vinegar.\n\n### Puddings and sweets\nHervey gives recipes for several Anglo-Indian puddings. \"'Bombay' Pudding\" calls for slices of stale bread in egg custard and fried in ghee. Her coconut pudding consists of grated coconut with sugar, butter, and eggwhite, baked in the oven. \"Raggi\" pudding is ground finger millet boiled with milk, sugar, and flavourings, and baked. Her banana pudding uses roasted plantains, sliced and flavoured, and boiled in pudding paste. Her rice pudding is baked with milk and sugar, topped with butter and nutmeg.\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nBrown, Patricia (24 February 1998). Anglo-Indian Food and Customs. Penguin Books India.

Curry dishes have their origins in the Indian subcontinent. Countries in Indochina typically use a coconut milk base in their curries; countries in Southwest Asia typically use a yogurt base.\n\n## Historical timeline\nA heavily influential aspect of Asian culture is the food, especially the various traditional ways of Asian cuisine and cooking. Although many Asian cultures often share the traditions of bringing the family or group together to socialize or have celebrations over a meal, the various cultures of Asia each developed their own individual ethnic cultural takes on food through the interaction of history, culture, and environment. Asian cuisine is often associated with multiculturalism with specific foods linked to many different cultures.\n\n## Central Asian cuisine\nMost Central Asian nations have similar cuisines to each other as well as their neighbors, taking many features of the neighboring cuisines of West and East Asia, particularly Iran and Mongolia.  A dish known as \"plov\", or \"osh\", for example, is a widespread variation of pilaf. However, many of the same countries use horse meat and mutton as the most common meats, similar to beef. This is owing to Mongolian cuisine. In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the cuisine has evolved to meet the needs of a nomad lifestyle.\nKumis is a widespread drink among Turkic peoples, especially in Central Asia.\nCentral Asia is also noted for being the birthplace of yogurt. Like kumis, it is widespread among Turkic peoples.\n\n## East Asian cuisine\nEast Asian cuisine includes Chinese, Hong Kong, Japanese, Korean, Macanese, Mongolian, Taiwanese, and Tibetan food. Considering this is the most populated region of the world, it has many regional cuisines (especially in China). Examples of staple foods include rice, noodles, mung beans, soybeans, seafood (Japan has the highest per capita consumption of seafood), mutton (Mongolia), bok choy (Chinese cabbage), and tea.\n\n## North Asian cuisine\nNorth Asian cuisine is often synonymous with Russian cuisine, due to all of North Asia being a part of the Russian Federation. However, some cultures or areas of Siberia have in-depth cuisine, such as the Yakuts (or Sakha) and Yamal cuisine. Buryats also have their own cuisine, although it is very similar to that of the related Mongolians.\nPelmeni, originally a Permic or Ugric dish, has entered into mainstream Russian cuisine as a well-known dish, but it can still be considered part of the Yamal cuisine for its area of origin.  Some speculate them to be a simplified version of the Chinese wonton.  In Siberia, pelmeni is frozen outdoors to preserve the meat inside throughout the long winter.  In Yamal, other types of drying and preservation are common.  Key ingredients in most northern Siberian cuisine include fish and cowberries, sometimes known as lingonberries in Europe and North America.  Yakuts, like many other Turkic-speaking peoples, traditionally enjoy kumis as a common drink.\n\n## South Asian cuisine\nSouth Asian cuisine includes cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. Food items in this region are generally rich in spices, however it also caters a blend of multi-cuisine culture from all across the world. Food is flavored with various types of chili, black pepper, cloves, condiments and other herbs and spices. Use of flavored butter and ghee is prominent in many places. Turmeric, coriander, and cumin are often used to make curries.\nThe multitude is inclined more towards the usage of mustard, groundnut, sunflower and soybean oil for cooking. Usage of refined oil to make pooris is quite famous.  Puri bhaji, idli, dosa, dal baati, and litti are among the most popular and representative dishes of Indian cuisines.\nVegetables are generally eaten with a type of bread called chapati, which is the staple food of the region. Rice is generally taken with dal to moisten it in northern India, or with curd in southern India. \nTea and coffee are prominent all across with the former available at every street corner. Egg dishes are also available in similar fashion.\nCommon meats include lamb, goat, fish, and chicken. As cattle are considered sacred in Hinduism, beef is less common than in Western cuisines. Prohibitions against beef extend to the meat of cows, and yaks to some extent. Pork is considered a haram by all Muslims, and is avoided by some Hindus. Other minorities also prohibit the use of meat to abjure violence. Fish is commonly used in South India, Sri Lanka and the Bengal region, i.e. Bangladesh and the West Bengal state of India. The Northern region diet mostly consists of wheat and other major crops.\n\n## Southeast Asian cuisine\nSoutheast Asian cuisine includes a strong emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with a strong aromatic component that features such flavors as citrus and herbs such as lime, coriander/cilantro and basil. Ingredients in the region contrast with the ones in the East Asian cuisines, substituting fish sauces for sauce and the inclusion of ingredients such as galangal, tamarind and lemongrass. Cooking methods include a balance of stir-frying, boiling and steaming.\n\n## West Asian cuisine\nWest Asian cuisine significantly overlaps with the Middle Eastern cuisine and the inclusion of the South Caucasus.\nWest Asian cuisine is the cuisine of the various countries and peoples of West Asia. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity. Some commonly used ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates, sumac, chickpeas, mint and parsley. Some popular dishes include kibbeh and shawarma.\nCereals constitute the basis of West Asian diet, both historically and today. Wheat and rice are the major and preferred sources of staple foods. Barley is also widely used in the region and maize has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple, eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups practically at every meal.\nButter and clarified butter (also known as Semna) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products.\nLamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of West Asia. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or kebabs. Meat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region.\nVegetables and pulses are the predominant staples of the great majority of the people in the West Asia. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and rice. Among the green leafy vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common.\n\n## See also\nList of Asian cuisines\n\n\n== References ==",

The discovery of this cuisine in the popular media continues, with the presenters yet to settle on the language and the specific distinctiveness to describe it.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n\n### Rice\nRice is the most important ingredient in this cuisine. The diversity of rice grown in the region has led to speculation that the grain was first domesticated in the Assam-Yunnan region. Both the indica as well as the japonica varieties are grown in Assam. The most popular class of rice is the joha or scented rice. As a staple, rice is eaten either steam boiled (ukhua) or sundried (aaroi). Some very high quality rice varieties, Karaballam or kauribadam etc., are available in Assam only.\nRice is eaten as a snack in many forms: roasted and ground (xandoh), boiled in its husk and flattened (chira), puffed (akhoi). Kumol saul is rice that is precooked, dried and then husked; it can be simply soaked in warm water and eaten as a light meal.\nRice is a part of all meals in Assam. A traditional breakfast consists of chira with yogurt and jaggery. Typically, farmers eat cooked rice soaked overnight (poita) simply accompanied with salt, mustard oil, onions, etc. Snacks are xandoh, kumol saul or boka saul, sticky rice or bora saul, which can be eaten with sweet or salty accompaniments. For other major meals, rice could be boiled, steamed, or wrapped in leaves and roasted. 'Sunga Saul' is a special preparation in which (sticky) rice (bora saul) is cooked in bamboo hollows called 'sunga'. 'Sewa diya Bhaat' is another preparation where sticky rice is steamed over boiling water. They are generally served with meat or fish. Sticky rice is also wrapped in leaves, usually plantain leaves or tora pat, and dropped into boiling water to prepare tupula bhat.\nA special class of rice preparations, called pithas are generally made only on special occasions like the Bihu. Made usually with soaked and ground glutinous rice (bora saul), they could be fried in oil with a sesame filling (xutuli pitha), roasted in young green bamboo over a slow fire (sunga pitha) or baked and rolled over a hot plate with a filling (kholasaporia pitha).\n\n### Fish\nThe next most important ingredient is fish, harvested from the many rivers, ponds and lakes in the region. The extremely wet climate and the large numbers of water bodies has ensured that large varieties of freshwater fish are available in abundance in the valley. It is a staple item in Assamese cuisine. There is no traditional ethnic community in Assam that does not eat fish. Most traditional rural households have their own ponds for pisciculture. Some of the most popular big fishes are the borali (freshwater dhark), rou, and cital (big), khoria (medium) (Chitala chitala), maagur, xingi, borali, bhokua or bahu, xal, and xoul. Small varieties of fish available and eaten in Assam include  puthi (swamp barb), ari (long-whiskered catfish), goroi (green snake head/spotted snake head), kawoi (climbing perch; Anabas testudineus), kholihona (Indian paradise fish; Ctenops nobilis) borolia, mua, seniputhi, tengera, lasin, bhangun, and pabho. \n\nThe mas tenga (sour fish), which is commonly eaten by most communities of Assam, has lately become a signature dish of Assamese cuisine. The most popular souring agent for the tenga is tomatoes, though ones made with kajinemu juice (thick skinned elongated lemon) and thekera (dried mangosteen), Ou-tenga, teteli, kordoi tenga (south-east Asian starfruit), and tengamora(roselle leaves) are also popular.\nThe most common way of eating fish in traditional Assamese homes is by preparing a stew with herbs, vegetables, and greens as per preference and availability. Fish is also prepared by roasting or char-grilling. A common favourite dish is a small fish roasted in banana leaves (paatotdia). Hukoti is a special fish dish prepared from dried small fish like (puthi maas) pounded with arum stem and dried and stored in bamboo tubes. Variations of this exist among the ethnic communities of northeast India in general and Assam in particular. Dried and fermented small fish puthy mas (Ticto barb), three to four in number, are roasted with lavish amounts of green chilis, tomatoes, ginger and garlic (all roasted). The ingredients are then pounded in a mortar to make a coarse paste and served with rice. Fish eggs and innards are also cooked and consumed. Petu bhoja (fried fish intestines) is also considered a delicacy along with the traditional Assamese Jal, which is an herbal fish curry made with medicinal herbs like bhedailota (Chinese fever vine), noroxingho (curry leaves), bon dhunia, man dhunia, manimuni (Asiatic Pennywort), tengesi leaves, and more. It is known for its rich flavour and medicinal and antioxidant qualities.\n\nSee also Fish of Assam\n\n### Meat\nThe Assamese meat and fish dishes are characterized by a low amount of spices and oil, higher quantity of ginger, noroxinghow paat (curry leaves), Khorisa (fermented bamboo shoot) and lemon juice, and differ completely in taste from the dishes of neighboring Bengal and are quite similar to the cuisines of nearby South-East Asian and East Asian countries. Chicken, venison, squab, mutton, duck and pork is very popular among the indigenous ethnic Assamese communities like Sonowals, Bodo, Rabha, Keot (Kaibarta), Ahom, Moran, Sutiya etc. Assamese Cast Hindus such as Assamese Brahmins (including Ganaks), Kaibarta, Rajbanshi, Kayasthas of Assam, Kalitas of Lower Assam refrain from pork and beef consumption. Beef is occasionally consumed by Assamese Muslims, although they traditionally refrain from consuming pork. The Christians, many indigenous Assamese communities, and the non religious sections consume all types of meat.\nThe basic cooking methods include cooking, shallow and deep frying. Onla, of the Bodos, is made with ground rice and special herbs and constitutes a complete meal in itself. Other meats include squab, duck, chicken, goat meat, venison, and turtle although venison and turtle meat are legally prohibited. The combination of duck/white gourd and squab/papaya or\nbanana flower is very popular. Meat is generally stewed using limited spices as well as a choice of herbs and vegetables.\nMost communities of Assam are entomophagous. Various indigenous ethnic groups of certain areas partake of the silkworm, water bugs, grasshoppers, and other insects. Insects are fried or cooked or roasted in leaves and then prepared according to the timing of the meal. The red ant eggs (amroli poruar tup) is considered a delicacy during the Rongali Bihu festival.\n\n### Green vegetables\nThe environs of Assam are rich in vegetation, and green leafy vegetables, called xaak, are an important part of the cuisine. Some of them are grown while others like the dhekia (fern) grows wild. There is a bewildering variety that is eaten and according to custom, one has to have 101 different xaak (greens) during Rongali Bihu. Herbs, greens, and vegetables are commonly eaten by simply cooking in water and salt, lightly frying, as a thick soup or by adding to varieties of lentils. They are also prepared in combination with fish, meat and eggs.\n\n### Spices of Assam\nAmong spices there are ginger, garlic, onion, cumin seed, black cumin, black pepper, chilli, turmeric, coriander seed, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, fenugreek seed, white mustard seed, aniseed, Malabar leaf, etc. Some herbs peculiar to Assam are maan dhaniya, moran Ada, madhuhuleng, bhedai lota, manimuni, masundari, tengesi, thekera, kordoi, outenga, tengamora': etc. An Assamese meal is incomplete without green chilis, many varieties of which are available in the region. Assam is famous for the bhut jolokia or ghost pepper, which was recognized as the hottest chili in the world. Panch-furan (mixture of 5 spices) is used for adding flavour to Dail. Dail was not originally eaten by the indigenous people of Assam, but has slowly been adopted and adapted to local preferences due to external influences.\n\n## Preparations\nAlthough the modern cuisine of Assam has been influenced to a small extent by East and North Indian cuisine, Assam is still rich in traditional dishes which are similar to the cuisines of East Asian and South-East Asian nations.\n\n### Khar\nThe khar is a signature class of preparations made with a key ingredient, also called khar. The traditional ingredient is made by filtering water through the ashes of the sun-dried skin of a few varieties of banana, which is then called kola khar (The name derived from the local term for banana, \"kol\" or \"kola.\") A traditional meal invariably begins with a khar dish, which can be prepared with raw papaya, mustard leaves, vegetables, pulses, fish or any other main ingredient.\nXôkôta is a severely bitter type of preparation. It is prepared with dry jute leaf, urad bean and khar. However, the combination of khar (alkaline) and tenga (acidic) is not recommended. The liquid khar is also simply eaten as kharoli with rice which is prepared by adding a few drops of mustard oil. Assamese people have a peculiar tradition of eating a large variety of bitter dishes, many of which are considered delicacies. Some dishes in this category include, fresh bamboo shoot, cooked or lightly fried, cane shoot, Neem leaves fried, titabhekuri, bitter gourd, Xukuta, Titaphool, Sewali Phool etc.\n\n### Masor tenga\nThe masor tenga is a light and sour fish dish, another signature class of preparations. There are numerous ways of preparing the sour fish curry among Assamese people. The souring ingredient could be mangosteen, lemon, tomatoes, roselle leaves, Outenga, Manimuni, Tengesi, etc. Another important ingredient is kokum. Fish dishes made with fermented bamboo shoot (khorisa) are generally sour, but they are not called tenga. Fish is fried in mustard oil or stewed with bottle gourd or spinach or boiled simply. Another tenga dish is prepared with matimah (urad bean) and outenga (elephant apple). Bottle gourd can be added to it. Tengamora (Roselle (plant)) or noltenga (Indian chestnut vine) and lentil is a distinct tenga curry.\n\n### Naraxingho masor jul\nThe naroxingho masor jul is another authentic dish from Assam.The fishes are cooked in a light gravy of curry leaves which is a common aromatic herb used in southern and some northern parts of India. The curry leaves are also known as noro-xingho paat in Assamese. The fish preparations in Assam emphasize on retaining the natural flavours of the fish, and hence, few spices are used.\n\n### Pura\nPura refers to various forms of grilled and roasted food. Vegetables, meat and fish are often served in this form. Aalu bengena pura pitika, pura maas pitika (mashed grilled fish), pura mankho etc. are a few of the popular dishes.\n\n### Poitabhat\nPoitabhat is a favourite dish in Assam during the summer season. Cooked rice is soaked overnight and left to ferment. It is and served with mustard oil, onion, chili, pickles, pitika (mashes), etc. The 'poitabhat' preparation is sometimes made alcoholic according to preference.\n\n### Pitika - পিটিকা\nSide dishes called pitika - পিটিকা (mashes) is a signature characteristic of this cuisine. The most popular is aloo pitika - আলু পিটিকা (mashed potatoes) garnished with raw onions, mustard oil, green chillies and sometimes boiled eggs. Khorisa tenga is mashed fermented bamboo shoot, sometimes pickled in mustard oil and spices. Kharoli is fermented mashed mustard (Brassica campestris var. toria) seed to which a khar has been added, and kahudi to which an acidic agent (lemon juice, dried mangosteen) has been added. Pitikas are also made from roasted or steamed vegetables (tomatoes and eggplants being very popular). Small fish, asiatic pennywort, matikaduri, tengamora leaves, heartleaf, dôrôn (Leucas longifolia), etc. are roasted separately wrapped in banana leaves and mashed into 'pitika'.\n\n### Pickle\nPickles are made of mango, indian gooseberry, hog plum, Indian olive, Tamarind, star fruit, mangosteen, radish, carrot, elephant apple, Indian jujube, chili, lime, garlic, etc. Panitenga and kharoli are signature Assamese pickles made from ground mustard seeds.\n\n### Chutney and salad\nChutney is made of coriander, spinach, tomato, heartleaf, curry leaf, chilli, lentil, chickpea etc. Xukan masor (chutney made of dried fish) is popular among the tribal communities. Salad is made of carrot, radish, tomato, cucumber, beetroot, etc.\n\n### Bor\n'Bor' are fried balls of mashed lentil or gram — it is equivalent to vada in few other Indian languages. It may contain other green leafy vegetable locally called 'xaak' within it, and it is best while served with 'teteli' (tamarind) curry or dip. There is a huge variety of 'bora' preparations in Assamese cuisine. The base ingredients include greens, vegetables, fruits, flowers, skin, and shoots of various plants. 'Bora' can also be prepared from fish eggs etc.\n\n### Fritter\nFritter is made of flower and tender leaves of pumpkin, banana, tender leaves of bottle gourd, eggplant, tender leaves of night-flowering jasmine, etc. It is a new style of cooking somewhat having external influences.\n\n### Some other preparations\nSome other preparations in Assamese cuisine include Kahudi, Panitenga, Khorikatdiya, Tenga sorsoriya, Posola, etc.\n\n### Beer\nLiquor is an integral part of linguistically and culturally diverse communities in Assamaese society. Rice is a primary ingredient for the many rice beers (Nam-lao - নাম-লাও) or (Laopani/Xaaj) and liquors made in Assam by different ethnic communities: zou (Bodo), Aapong (Mishing), Rohi (ৰহি) and Mod (মদ) (Sonowal Kachari), Chuje (Chutia), Nam-lao -নাম-লাও (Tai-Ahom), Haj (Tiwa), Hor (Karbi), Photika - ফটিকা (Kachari), etc.\n\n## Snacks and cakes\n\n\n### Jolpan\nJolpan (snacks) in Assamese are often considered breakfast foods, although they are not always served as breakfast in Assamese cuisine. They are eaten as light meals between main meals and widely served during Bihu, weddings, Assamese shraadhs or any other kind of special occasions and gatherings. Some types of jolpan are Bora saul (varieties of sticky rice), Komal Saul, Xandoh, Chira, Muri, Akhoi, Sunga saul, etc., eaten in combination with hot milk, curd, jaggery, yogurt or seasonal ripe fruits. These are probably some of the earliest forms of \"cereals\". Assamese people have been eating them mainly as breakfast for many centuries.\n\n### Pitha\nPitha (rice cake) is a special class of rice preparation generally made only on occasions like Bhogali Bihu in Assam. Made usually with soaked and ground rice, they could be fried in oil, roasted over a slow fire or baked and rolled over a hot plate. Some pithas are Til Pitha, Ghila Pitha, Xutuli Pitha, Sunga Pitha, Bhapotdiya Pitha, Lakhimi Pitha, Tora Pitha, Tekeli Pitha, Deksi Pitha, Muthiya Pitha, Kholasapori Pitha, etc.\nIt is made in other areas of East and South-East Asia and has similarities with them rather than any Mainland Indian cuisine form etc.\n\n### Laru\nLarus are sweet balls that are associated with traditional Assamese food: Laskara, narikolor laru, tilor laru are often seen in Assamese cuisine.\n\n### Tea\nTea (Saah in Assamese) is an indispensable part of Assamese cuisine. It is served in form of Black tea, Milk tea, Herbal tea, Spiced tea, Green Tea, Lemon tea (adding lemon juice to black tea), etc. Most of the Assamese people like to drink laal saah(red tea).\n\n## Tamul\nAn Assamese meal is generally concluded with the chewing of tamul (Assamese: তামোল). Pieces of betel nut (Areca catechu) are eaten in combination with betel leaf (Piper betle), edible limestone and tobacco.\n\n## See also\nList of vegetables used in Assamese cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Furth reading\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Cuisine of Assam at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Australian cuisine\n\nAustralian cuisine is the food and cooking practices of Australia and its inhabitants. Australia has absorbed culinary contributions and adaptations from various cultures around the world, including British, European, Asian and Middle Eastern.\nIndigenous Australians have occupied Australia for some 65,000 years, during which they developed a unique hunter-gatherer diet, known as bush tucker, drawn from regional Australian plants and animals.

The Australian gold rushes introduced more varied immigrants and cuisines, mainly Chinese, whilst post-war immigration programs led to a large-scale diversification of local food, mainly due to the influence of migrants from the Mediterranean, East Asia and South Asia.\nAustralian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential. Organic and biodynamic foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bush tucker. Australia exports many agricultural products, including cattle, sheep, poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, nuts, wheat, barley and canola. Australia also produces wine, beer and soft drinks.\nWhile fast food chains are abundant, Australia's metropolitan areas have restaurants that offer both local and international foods. Restaurants which include contemporary adaptations, interpretations or fusions of exotic influences are frequently termed Modern Australian.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Indigenous Australian bush food\nIndigenous Australians have lived off native flora and fauna of the Australian bush for over 60,000 years. In modern times, this collection of foods and customs has become known as bush tucker.\nIt is understood that up to 5,000 species of Australian flora and fauna were eaten by Indigenous Australians. Hunting of kangaroo, wallaby and emu was common, with other foods widely consumed including bogong moths, witchetty grubs, lizards and snakes. Bush berries, fruits, and nuts were also used, including the now widely cultivated macadamia nut, and wild honeys were also exploited. Fish were caught using tools such as spears, hooks and traps; in some areas, the construction of complex weir systems allowed the development of forms of aquaculture.\nResource availability and dietary make-up varied from region to region and scientific theories of bush tucker plants being spread by hand have recently emerged. Food preparation techniques also varied; however, a common cooking technique was for the carcass to be thrown directly on a campfire to be roasted.\nNative food sources were used to supplement the colonists' diet following the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in 1788.\n\n### Development of Australian cuisine\nFollowing the pre-colonial period, European colonisers began arriving with the First Fleet at Sydney harbour in 1788. The diet consisted of \"bread, salted meat and tea with lashings of rum (initially from the West Indies but later made from the waste cane of the sugar industry in Queensland).\" The British found familiar game in Australia including swan, goose, pigeon and fish, but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet.  Meat constituted a large proportion of the Australian diet during the colonial era and into the 20th century.\nAfter initial difficulties, Australian agriculture became a major global producer and supplied fresh produce for the local market. Stock grazing (mostly sheep and cattle) is prevalent throughout the continent. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia's main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. Sugar cane is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia and wheat is a main component of the Australian diet. Today there are over 85,681 farm businesses in Australia, 99 percent of which are locally owned and operated.\nBarbecued meat is almost synonymous with Australian cuisine, though it is estimated that more than 10% of Australians are now vegetarian.\n\n### Modern Australian cuisine\nAfter World War II, subsequent waves of multicultural immigration, with a majority drawn from Asia and the Mediterranean region, and the strong, sophisticated food cultures these ethnic communities have brought with them influenced the development of Australian cuisine.  This blending of \"European techniques and Asian flavours\" came to be known as Modern Australian cuisine.\nArguably the first Modern Australian restaurant was Sydney's Bayswater Brasserie (est. 1982), which offered Mediterranean dishes with Asian and Middle Eastern influences and \"showed Sydney [...] that food can be adventurous without being expensive\".  The term itself was first used in print in the 1993 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide, which placed 34 restaurants under this heading, and was quickly adopted to describe the burgeoning food scene in Sydney in the 1990s.  Leading exponents of the style include Tetsuya Wakuda, Neil Perry and Peter Gilmore.\nAs of 2014, the term is considered somewhat dated, with many restaurants preferring to call their style \"contemporary Australian cuisine\" instead.\n\n## Fruit and vegetables\n\n\n### Fruit\nThere are many species of Australian native fruits, such as quandong (native peach), wattleseed, muntries/munthari berry, Illawarra plums, riberry, native raspberries, and lilli pillies, as well as a range of native citrus species including the desert lime and finger lime. These usually fall under the category of bush tucker, which is used in some restaurants and in commercial preserves and pickles but not generally well known among Australians due to its low availability.\nAustralia also has large fruit-growing regions in most states for tropical fruits in the north, and stone fruits and temperate fruits in the south which has a mediterranean or temperate climate. The Granny Smith variety of apples originated in Sydney in 1868. Another well-known Western Australian apple variety is the Cripps Pink, known locally and internationally as \"Pink Lady\" apples, which was first cultivated in 1973.\nFruits cultivated and consumed in Australia include apples, banana, kiwifruit, oranges and other citrus, mangoes (seasonally), mandarin, stonefruit, avocado, watermelons, rockmelons, lychees, pears, nectarines, plums, apricots, grapes, melons, papaya (also called pawpaw), pineapple, passionfruit and berries (strawberries, raspberries, etc.).\n\n### Vegetables\nIn the temperate regions of Australia vegetables are traditionally eaten seasonally, especially in regional areas, although in urban areas there is large-scale importation of fresh produce sourced from around the world by supermarkets and wholesalers for grocery stores, to meet demands for year-round availability. Spring vegetables include artichoke, asparagus, bean shoots, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, leek, lettuce, mushrooms, peas, rhubarb, and spinach; summer vegetables include capsicum, cucumber, eggplant, squash, tomato, and zucchini.\n\n## Meat and poultry\nChicken is the most commonly consumed of all meats or poultry by weight, with approximately 47 kilograms of chicken consumed by the average Australian per year.\n\nAs of July 2018 Australians ate around 25 kilograms of beef per person with beef having a 35% share of fresh meat sales by value, the highest of any fresh meat in 2018–19.\nLamb is very popular in Australia, with roasting cuts (legs and shoulders), chops, and shanks being the most common cuts. Lamb will often form part of either a Sunday roast or a barbecue. It is also commonly found as an ingredient in gyros (\"yiros\") and doner kebabs, brought by Greek and Turkish  immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. Australia consumes more lamb and mutton than any other country listed by the OECD-FAO (with Kazakhstan in second place). In 2017, Australians consumed an average of 8.5 kilograms (19 lb) per person. By way of comparison, New Zealanders average 3.2 kilograms (7.1 lb) and Americans just 0.4 kilograms (0.88 lb).\nLunch at an Australian pub is called a counter lunch, while the term counter meal is used for either lunch or dinner. Common dishes served at counter lunches and counter meals are steak and chips, chicken parmigiana and chips, a mixed grill (an assortment of grilled meats), and roast lamb or beef with roast vegetables.\nLunch meats are known as smallgoods in Australia and New Zealand, referring to products such as ham, bacon, sausages or salami.\n\n### Game\nKangaroo meat is available as game in Australia, although it is not among the most commonly eaten meats. In colonial-era recipes, kangaroo was treated much like ox tail, and braised until tender forming a rich gravy. It is available today in various cuts and sausages. Kangaroo is, however, a common commercial dog food in Australia.\nOther less commonly eaten forms of game are emu and crocodile.\n\n## Fish and seafood\nSeafood consumption is increasing, but it is less common in the Australian diet than poultry and beef.\nAustralian cuisine features Australian seafood such as southern bluefin tuna, King George whiting, Moreton Bay bugs, mud crab, jewfish, dhufish (Western Australia) and yabby. Australia is one of the largest producers of abalone and rock lobster.\n\nFish and chips is a take-away food that originated in the United Kingdom and remains popular in Australia. It generally consists of battered deep-fried fish with deep-fried chipped (slab-cut) potatoes. Rather than cod which is more common in the UK, the most popular fish at Australian fish and chips shops, at least in southern Australian states, is flake, a fillet of gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus).\nFlathead is also a popular sport and table fish found in all parts of Australia. Barramundi is a fish found in northern Australian river systems. Bay lobsters, better known in Australia as Moreton Bay bugs, are common in seafood restaurants, or may be served with steak as \"surf and turf\".\nThe most common species of the aquaculture industry are salmon, tuna, oysters, and prawns. Other food species include abalone, freshwater finfish (such as barramundi, Murray cod, silver perch), brackish water or marine finfish (such as barramundi, snapper, yellowtail kingfish, mulloway, groupers), mussels, mud crabs and sea cucumbers.\nWhile inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide freshwater game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy. Approximately 600 varieties of marine and freshwater seafood species are caught and sold in Australia for both local and overseas consumption. European carp, common in the Murray River as an invasive species, is not considered edible by most Australians despite being common in cuisines across Europe.\n\n## Dairy\nEver since the first British settlement of 1788, Australia has had a dairy industry. Today, the Australian dairy industry produces a wide variety of milk, cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt products.\nAustralians are high consumers of dairy products, consuming on average some 102.4 litres (22.5 imp gal; 27.1 US gal) of milk per person a year, 12.9 kilograms (28 lb) of cheese, 3.8 kilograms (8.4 lb) of butter (a small reduction from previous year, largely for dietary purposes) and 7.1 kilograms (16 lb) of yoghurt products.\n\n## Beverages\n\n\n### Tea\nFor most of Australia's history following the arrival of British settlers, black tea was the most commonly consumed hot beverage; however, in the 1980s, coffee overtook tea in popularity. In the 19th century, billy tea was a staple drink for those out in the Australian bush, such as those working on the land or travelling overland. Boiling water for tea in a billy over a camp fire and adding a gum leaf for flavouring remains an iconic traditional Australian method for preparing tea. Famously, it was prepared by the ill-fated swagman in the Australian folksong \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nTea and biscuits or freshly home-baked scones are common for afternoon tea between friends and family.\n\n### Coffee\nToday's Australia has a distinct coffee culture. The coffee industry has grown from independent cafes since the early 20th century. The flat white  became popular in Australia some time after 1985, and its invention is claimed by a Sydneysider (although this claim is disputed by a New Zealand-based barista). The iconic Greek cafés of Sydney and Melbourne were the first to introduce locally roasted coffees in 1910. US military personnel stationed in Australia during the Second World War helped to spread the habit of coffee drinking, initially in the form of instant coffee.\nIn 1952, the first espresso machines began to appear in Australia and a plethora of fine Italian coffee houses were emerging in Melbourne and Sydney. Pellegrini's Espresso Bar and Legend Café often lay claim to being Melbourne's first 'real' espresso bars, opening their doors in 1954 and 1956 respectively. This decade also saw the establishment of one of Australia's most iconic coffee brands, Vittoria, which remains the country's largest coffee maker and distributor. The brand has existed in Australia since 1958, well before it moved to the US.\n\nTo this day, international coffee chains such as Starbucks have very little market share in Australia, with Australia's long established independent cafés existing along with homegrown franchises such as The Coffee Club, Michel's Patisserie, Dôme in WA, and Zarraffas Coffee in Queensland. One reason for this is that unlike with the United States and Asia, Australia for many decades had already had an established culture of independent cafés before coffee chains tried to enter the market.\n\n### Other hot beverages\nThe chocolate and malt powder Milo, which was developed by Thomas Mayne in Sydney in 1934 in response to the Great Depression, is mixed with cold or hot milk to produce a popular beverage. In recent years, Milo has been exported and is also commonly consumed in Southeast Asia even becoming a major ingredient in some desserts produced in the region.\n\n### Alcohol\nBeer in Australia has been popular since colonial times. James Squire is considered to have founded Australia's first commercial brewery in 1798 and the Cascade Brewery in Hobart, Tasmania, has been operating since the early 19th century. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally – with Foster's Lager being an iconic export brand. However, Fosters is not a large seller on the local market, with alternatives such as Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught outselling the popular export. Craft beer is popular, as well as distinctive products from smaller breweries such as Coopers and Little Creatures.\nThe Australian wine industry is the fifth largest exporter of wine around the world, with 760 million litres a year to a large international export market and contributes $5.5 billion per annum to the nation's economy. Australians consume over 530 million litres annually with a per capita consumption of about 30 litres – 50% white table wine, 35% red table wine. Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totalling approximately 160,000 hectares. Australia's wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country, in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Amongst the most famous wine districts are the Barossa Valley, Hunter Valley, Margaret River and Yarra Valley, and among the best known wine producers are Lindeman's, Penfolds, Rosemount Estate, Wynns Coonawarra Estate. In Australia's tropical regions, wine is produced from exotic fruits such as mango, passion fruit and lychees.\nIn modern times, South Australia has also become known for its growing number of premium spirits producers, with the South Australian Spirits industry quickly emerging as a world leader with producers being recognised globally such as Seppeltsfield Road Distillers, Never Never Distilling, Adelaide Hills Distilling and many more.\nRum served as a currency during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Australia when metallic currency was in short supply.\n\n## Take-away and convenience foods\nThe traditional places to buy take-away food in Australia has long been at a local milk bar, fish and chip shop, or bakery, though these have met with stiff competition from fast food chains and convenience stores in recent decades.\nIconic Australian take-away food (i.e. fast food) includes meat pies, sausage rolls, pasties, Chiko Rolls, and dim sims. Meat pies, sausage rolls, and pasties are often found at milk bars, bakeries, and petrol stations, often kept hot in a pie warmer or needing to be microwaved; meat pies are also a staple at Australian Rules football matches. Chiko Rolls, dim sims and other foods that need to be deep-fried are to be found at fish and chip shops, which have the necessary deep fryers in which to cook them.\nBread rolls, with a variety of fillings, are a common alternative to sandwiches, with double-cut rolls (effectively two sandwiches) a South Australian specialty.\nAustralian hamburgers and steak sandwiches are mainly to be found at fish and chip shops. Australian hamburgers consist of a grilled beef patty, served with shredded lettuce and sliced tomato in a (usually toasted) round bread roll or bun, along with tomato sauce (less commonly, barbecue sauce). Common options to add include bacon, cheese, fried onions, fried egg, a slice of beetroot, and a slice of pineapple. A slice of gherkin is rarely included; these are a feature of burgers from American chains, not Australian. Steak sandwiches come with the same options, but instead of a beef patty, they consist of a thin steak and are served in two slices of toast, not buns.\nPizza has also become a popular take-away food item in Australia.\nCommonly found at community and fundraising events are sausage sizzle stalls – a stall with a barbecue hot plate on which sausages are cooked. At a sausage sizzle the sausage is served in a slice of white bread, with or without tomato sauce and with the option of adding fried onions, and eaten as a snack or as a light lunch. A sausage sizzle at a polling station on any Australian state or Federal election day has humorously become known as a Democracy sausage. Similar stalls are held in the car parks of most Bunnings hardware stores on weekends, by volunteers fund-raising for service clubs, charities, societies or sporting groups. The company supplies the infrastructure and enforces standards, including prices.\nThe halal snack pack (\"HSP\", also known in South Australia as an AB) originated in Australia as a fusion of Middle Eastern and European flavours, common at kebab shops around Australia. It consists of doner kebab meat served over hot chips and covered in sauces (such as chilli, garlic, or barbecue sauce).\n\n### Sushi (Australian style)\nSushi is a widely consumed takeaway food in Australia, commonly sold in shopping centres, food courts and dedicated sushi outlets. A distinctive local format is the large, uncut sushi hand roll, typically wrapped in nori and filled with ingredients such as teriyaki chicken, tuna, salmon and avocado. This style differs from traditional Japanese sushi in both portion size and flavour combinations, reflecting adaptation to Australian tastes.\nThe rapid expansion of sushi outlets from the 1990s onward contributed to its mainstream popularity as an affordable lunch option. Franchise chains such as Sushi Sushi played a significant role in standardising and popularising the grab-and-go model nationwide.\n\n### Bánh mì\nBánh mì is a Vietnamese sandwich that has become a prominent feature of Australia’s multicultural takeaway food culture. Introduced by Vietnamese migrants following increased migration from the 1970s, bánh mì became established in suburbs with significant Vietnamese communities, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. Traditional fillings include cold cuts, pâté, pickled vegetables, coriander and chilli in a crusty baguette, while contemporary Australian variants often feature roast pork belly and other adaptations.\nBánh mì is widely available beyond Vietnamese communities and is regarded as an affordable and portable lunch option across major Australian cities.\n\n## Baked goods and desserts\nDamper is a traditional Australian bread prepared by swagmen, drovers and other travellers. It is a wheat-flour-based bread, traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire. Toast is commonly eaten at breakfast. An iconic commercial spread is Vegemite, a salty, B vitamin-rich savoury spread made from brewers yeast eaten on buttered toast, commonly at breakfast, or in sandwiches. A common children's treat dating back to the 1920s is fairy bread, appearing around the same time as the Boston bun.\nA classic Australian biscuit is the ANZAC biscuit, which are often homemade and so-called as they were sent by families and friends to Australian soldiers fighting in Europe and the Dardanelles in the First World War. A popular commercial brand of biscuit are Arnott's Tim Tams.\nA classic Australian cake is the lamington, made from two squares of butter cake or sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut.The food is sweet. Another popular cake and dessert dish is the pavlova, a meringue-based dessert; however, the origins of this are contested as New Zealand also lays claim to its invention. The Neenish tart is one more Australian baked good, with a pastry base, dried icing in two colours on top, and a filling of cream/jam.\nThe mango pancake, a stable of Yum Cha restaurants in Sydney and elsewhere in Australia, is believed to have originated in Sydney in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n## Regional cuisines\nAs well as national icons, Australia has many iconic regional cuisines.\n\n### New South Wales\nSaccostrea glomerata, known in Australia as the Sydney rock oyster, or, more recently, as just the rock oyster, is a culinary delicacy in Sydney. Rock oysters are also popular in other NSW locations such as Merimbula; in 2025, Destination NSW reported that oyster trails, tours and tastings were supporting a rising demand for agritourism in that State. Endemic to Australia and New Zealand, rock oysters inhabit sheltered estuaries and bays between Hervey Bay, Queensland, and Wingan Inlet, Victoria (amongst other places in Australia), and are also commercially grown, predominantly on NSW's 2,000 km-long (1,200 mi) coastline.\nAn associated dish, carpetbag steak, became popular in Sydney in about 1950. As eaten in that city, it is made up of a thick cut of beef with a deep incision filled with rock oysters, usually dipped in Worcestershire sauce. Sometimes the filling is supplemented with butter, lemon juice, parsley, bread crumbs, or shredded cheese. The filled steak is then either pan fried or oven broiled, and most often served rare.\nCarpetbag steak is not an Australian invention; it traces its origins to Mumbles, an oyster-fishing village in Swansea, South Wales, UK. But after finding favour in Sydney, its popularity spread, with local variations, to the United Kingdom, South Africa, and other places. In the United States, radio programs broadcast in the early 1950s associated the dish with Australia, as did news articles published in the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000s. Meanwhile, in Australia as a whole, carpetbag steak experienced \"something of a heyday\" in the 1950s and 1960s, and was an \"iconic menu item\" until the 1990s. As of 2025, it was still on the menu of Charcoal Restaurant, a long-established steak house in Canberra.\n\n### Queensland\nQueensland has Weis Fruit Bar and claims the lamington.\nThe cuisine of Brisbane derives from mainstream Australian cuisine, as well as many cuisines of international origin. Major native foods of the Brisbane region and commonly used in local cuisine include the macadamia, lemon-scented myrtle, Australian finger lime, bunya nut, and Moreton Bay bug. The city's cuisine culture is often described as casual with an emphasis on outdoor dining. Roof-top dining has become an iconic part of the culinary landscape, as well as a large street food scene with food trucks and pop-up bars common.\nBrisbane also lays claim to several foods including \"smashed avo\". Although popularised in Sydney in the 1990s, smashed avocado was a common dish in Brisbane and Queensland dating back to the 1920s.\n\n### South Australia\nSouth Australia has FruChocs, King George whiting, and a range of foods of German origin including mettwurst, Bienenstich (beesting), streuselkuchen (German cake) and fritz.\nThe State also has its own iconic brands such as Farmers Union Iced Coffee, YoYo biscuits and Balfours frog cakes. Jubilee cake is a specialty of South Australia, as is the Kitchener bun.\nIn Adelaide, a variant on the meat pie is the pie floater, which is a meat pie served in a bowl of pea soup.\n\n### Tasmania\nTasmania has leatherwood honey, abalone, and savoury toast.\n\n### Victoria\nThe famous Australian meat pie owes much of its status as an Australian food icon due to the Four'n Twenty pie company, established in Bendigo in 1947, mass-producing pies of a size that could be easily eaten standing and with one hand and selling them from their own fleet of vans at Australian Rules Football matches or at football oval kiosks. Piping hot meat pies then grew rapidly in popularity during the 1950s in Melbourne, where they became a welcome warming bite to eat at football matches on Melbourne‘s all too common cold, rainy and windy winter days.\nVictoria is also famous for its home-grown Melbourne invention, the dim sim, which dates back to the 1940s, and another Bendigo invention, the Chiko Roll, which debuted in 1951. Melbourne is also the home of the hot jam donut.\n\n### Western Australia\nIn Western Australia, the conti roll, or continental roll, is a popular sandwich. It has been described as both \" ... a singularly Western Australian creation ...\" and \"... the closest thing ... West Australians have to a regional sandwich.\" Conti rolls may have been born, and certainly were raised, in the inner-city Perth locality now known as Northbridge.\nAnother WA treat is green-coloured, spearmint-flavoured milk.\nIn the 1970s, Peter Kailis, co-founder of the WA-established, now national fast food chain Red Rooster, invented the Hawaiian Pack, made up of rotisserie chicken, a deep-fried banana and a pineapple ring. As of 2025, Red Rooster was no longer selling a Hawaiian Pack. However, its \"Box Meals\" menu included a \"Trop Box\" with pineapple rings but no banana, and its WA-based rival Chicken Treat was offering a \"Hawaiian Quarter\" with \"Pineapple Fritter, [and] Deep Fried Bananas\".\nOther fast food outlets with origins, or Australian origins, in WA include Hungry Jack's, Nando's, and the now-defunct Chooks Fresh & Tasty.\n\n## See also\nList of Australian and New Zealand dishes\nAustralian wine\nAustralian whisky\nChinese restaurants in Australia\nCulture of Australia\nBush tucker\nCuisine of Brisbane\nAustralian Aboriginal sweets\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n\n## External links\n\naussiefoodie.com – a website devoted to \"Simple Classic Aussie Cooking\"\nAustralian food and drink – Native Australians and early settlers\nAustralian Flavour – Recipes verified as having been cooked in Australian in the late 1800s and 1900s plus others considered iconic",

    "text": "# Awadhi cuisine\n\nAwadhi cuisine (Hindi: अवधी पाक-शैली, Urdu: اودھی کھانے) is a cuisine native to the Awadh region in northern India and southern Nepal.  Awadhi cuisine can be divided into traditional Awadhi cuisines and Nawabi cuisines. Cooking patterns of Lucknow are similar to those of Central Asia, the Middle East, and northern India and Western India with the cuisine comprising both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The Awadh region has been influenced by Mughal cooking techniques and the cuisine of Lucknow, which bears similarities to those of Central Asia, Kashmir, Punjab and Hyderabad. The city is also known for its Nawabi foods.\n\n## Nawabi cuisine\nThe bawarchis (chefs) and rakabdars (gourmet cooks) of Awadh invented the dum style of cooking, or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which is strongly associated with Lucknow today. Their meals consisted of elaborate dishes such as kebabs, kormas, biryanis, kaliyas, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, rumali rotis, and warqi parathas. The richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices, which include cardamom and saffron.\n\nKebabs are an integral part of Awadhi cuisine. There are several varieties of well-known kebabs in Awadhi cuisine, including kakori kebabs, galawat ke kebabs, shami kebabs, boti kebabs, patili ke kebabs, ghutwa kebabs and seekh kebabs.\nThe kebabs of Awadhi cuisine are distinct from the kebabs of Punjab insofar as Awadhi kebabs are grilled on a chula and sometimes in a skillet as opposed to grilled in a tandoor in Punjab. Awadhi kebabs are also called \"chula\" kebabs whereas the kebabs of Punjab are called \"tandoori\" kebabs.\nAwadhi cuisine, although similar to Mughlai cuisine, differs in its approach to cooking. Where Mughal dishes are rich in fats due to extensive use of milk, cream and spices, Awadhi food is more subtle.\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Kebabs\nAwadhi kebabs include:\nThe seekh kebab was introduced by the Mughals; it was originally prepared from beef mince on skewers and cooked on charcoal fires. Now lamb mince is preferred for its soft texture.\nEstablished in 1905, tunde ke kabab in Chowk is the most famous outlet for kababs even today. The tunde kabab is so named because it was the speciality of a one-armed chef. The tunde kabab claims to be unique because of the zealously guarded family secret recipe for the masala (homemade spices), prepared by women in the family. It is said to incorporate 160 spices.\nThe kakori kabab is considered blessed since it was said to be originally made in the place by the same name in the dargah of Shah Abi Ahder Sahib with divine blessings. The meat used is from the tendon of the leg of mutton, combined with khoya and spices.\nThe shami kebab is made from mincemeat, usually with chopped onion, coriander, and green chillies added. The kebabs are round patties filled with spicy mix and tangy raw green mango. The best time to have them is in May, when mangoes are young. When mangoes are not in season, kamrakh or karonda may be substituted for kairi, as both have a tart flavour reminiscent of raw mango.\nA variant made without any admixture or binding agents and comprising just the minced meat and the spices is the galawat kabab.\nAn unusual offering is the pasanda kebab, piccata of lamb marinated and then sautéed on a griddle.\nThe boti kebab is lamb marinated in yoghurt and cooked on skewers in a tandoor oven.\nVegetarian kebabs include dalcha kebab, kathal ke kebab, arbi ke kebab, rajma galoti kebab, and zamikand ke kebab, among others.\n\n### Curries\nKorma is the Indian name for the technique of braising meat. It originated in Mughlai cuisine wherein lamb or chicken was braised in velvety, spiced sauces, enriched with ground nuts, cream and butter. While kormas are rich, they are also mild, containing little or no cayenne or chillies. There are both vegetarian (navratan korma) and non-vegetarian (chicken, lamb, beef and fish korma) varieties of korma. Murgh Awadhi korma is a classic from Lucknow.\n\n### Rice dishes\nBiryani is widespread in Awadhi cuisine. When cooking it, pilau is first made by cooking basmati rice in ghee with warm, aromatic spices and then layered with meat curry or marinade (depending on the type of biryani), sealed, and cooked over low heat (dum cooking) until done.\n\n### Breads\nAs wheat is the staple food of the state, breads are significant. Breads are generally flatbreads baked in a pan; only a few varieties are raised breads. Improvisations of the roti (or bread) are of different types and made in various ways and include the rumaali roti, tandoori roti, naan (baked in a tandoor), kulcha, lachha paratha, sheermaal and bakarkhani.\nBreads made of other grains have descriptive names only, such as makai ki roti, jowar ki roti (barley flour roti), bajre ki roti (pearl millet roti), and chawal ki roti (roti of rice flour).\n\nChapati is eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\nPuri are small and deep-fried so they puff up.\nParatha is a common roti variant that is flaky, layered and lightly fried. It is frequently stuffed with vegetables, pulses, cottage cheese, or mincemeat.\nRumali roti is a thin bread baked on a convex metal pan. The Hindi word rumaali means 'handkerchief'.\nTandoori roti is thicker bread baked in a tandoor, and can be crispy or chewy depending on its thickness.\nNaan is a pan-baked soft thick bread.\nSheermaal is a sweet baked yeast naan made with flour, milk, sugar, and saffron.\nBaqarkhani is a variation of sheermaal cooked on a griddle rather than baked.\n\n### Desserts\nHalwas of all kinds are a common dessert within the cuisine, particularly in winter. There are several varieties of these, prepared from different cereals, such as gram flour, sooji, wheat, nuts, and eggs. The special halwa or halwa sohan, has four varieties: Papadi, Jauzi, Habshi, and Dudhiya.\n\n### Chaats\nChaat originated in Uttar Pradesh but are now popular across South Asia as a staple of street food. The chaat variants are based on fried dough, with added ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato, chickpeas, spices, chilli, saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), coriander leaves, and yogurt, but other popular variants include aloo tikkis (garnished with onion, coriander, hot spices and a dash of curd), dahi puri, golgappa, dahi vada and papri chaat.\n\nThere are common elements among these variants including dahi, or yogurt; chopped onions and coriander; sev (small dried yellow salty noodles); and chaat masala, a spice mix typically consisting of amchoor (dried mango powder), cumin, kala namak (rock salt), coriander, dried ginger, salt, black pepper, and red pepper. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a banana leaf, dried and formed into a bowl.\n\n## See also\nCuisine of Uttar Pradesh\nDesi cuisine\nFaizabad\nIndian cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nBiryani : Their Kings and Kinds\nIndian Ambassador opens The thirteen-day Indian Food Festival 'Awadhi 'Lucknowi' in Doha\n'Almond Seera' Archived 22 February 2020 at the Wayback Machine",

Balti sauce is based on garlic and onions, with spices including turmeric and garam masala. The dish was developed in Birmingham, England in the 1970s. A region of Birmingham with many balti restaurants has become known as the Balti Triangle. An application was made to the  European Union to make \"Birmingham Balti\" a traditional speciality guaranteed product; the application failed because the allowed variations were not precisely defined.\n\n## Origin\n\n\n### Baltistan\nThe food writer Pat Chapman believed that balti curry could be traced to the area of Baltistan, in Northern Kashmir, and in 1998 published a book, Balti Bible, about the supposed cuisine. Adil's restaurant in Stoney Lane, Sparkbrook, a district of Birmingham, founded in 1977, called itself \"the home of Balti Cuisine\", stating that its dishes followed the traditions of Northern Kashmir. However, the Canadian food writer Colleen Taylor Sen states that balti's origins are unclear, as the food eaten in Baltistan \"bears no resemblance\" to balti curry. A typical Gilgit-Baltistan dish is rdoong balay, a stew made of ground wheat, potatoes, peas, and spices.\n\n### Balti cooking pot\nSen suggests instead that the name of the food may have originated from the fact that it is cooked in a pot named a baltī, similar to a karahi. The word \"balti\" is the Hindi for \"bucket\", from the Portuguese balde of the same meaning. It is claimed that the thin steel balti wok was, like the curry, invented and manufactured in Birmingham in the 1970s, differing from traditional heavy cast iron cooking pots.\n\n### A piece of marketing\nHowever, some balti restaurateurs of Birmingham have claimed that they invented the dish to please their white British clientele. The British-Pakistani scholar of culture Ziauddin Sardar describes the invention as a triumph of marketing, making balti houses seem more authentic than \"the bog-standard confines of curry and vindaloo\". Sardar comments that he personally cannot tell balti from other curries. The scholar of food Parama Roy, citing Sardar, adds that the success of the marketing effort \"is evidenced by the publication of the Balti Bible by Pat Chapman\". The historian of food Lizzie Collingham and the Oxford English Dictionary concur that Pakistani restaurateurs invented balti in Birmingham. In 2014, the Indian cook Madhur Jaffrey described the balti style of cooking as a \"craze with no authentic origins which will slowly die as people's tastes turn to more complex dishes\".\n\n## Dish\nA balti curry as originally cooked in Birmingham is stir-fried in very hot vegetable oil rather than ghee. The base of the curry is onion or tomato, mixed with garlic and ginger, and spiced with cumin, fenugreek, garam masala, and turmeric; the meat is usually chicken or lamb.\nCollingham writes that despite the supposed Kashmir origin, \"the restaurant balti unashamedly makes a virtue out of restaurant short cuts.\" She describes the dish as using meat which has been marinated and then pre-cooked. A separately prepared sauce is \"a version of Indian restaurant curry sauce\". She lists both onions and tomatoes as ingredients, and describes fresh coriander as \"important\". The mix of oil-fried spices can be varied. Finally, she states that variations are created by adding a choice of alternative ingredients such as fenugreek, lentils, or pieces of pineapple.\n\n## Balti houses\nBalti restaurants are often known in Birmingham as 'balti houses'. These typically offer large karack naan bread pieces, to be shared by the whole table. Some 50 balti houses were originally clustered along and behind the main road between Sparkhill and Moseley, to the south of Birmingham city centre. This area, comprising Ladypool Road, Stoney Lane, and Stratford Road, is sometimes called the Balti Triangle, as it contains a high concentration of balti restaurants. On 28 July 2005, a tornado caused extensive damage to buildings in the triangle, forcing many restaurants to close. Most reopened by the beginning of 2006 but by 2023 only four remained.\nSince the late 1990s, British supermarkets have stocked a growing range of prepacked balti meals, and the balti restaurant sector has faced increasing competition both from retail and from changes in customer tastes.\n\n## Application for EU protected status\nIn 2012, the Birmingham Balti Association applied to the European Union to make \"Birmingham Balti\" a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) product, claiming that two features made it distinctive, namely cooking with vegetable oil, and incorporating each ingredient separately while the stir-frying. The application was pursued until 2016 but failed. The reason for rejecting the application was that the dish was not cooked to a standard recipe, or as the EU stated:\n\nSome different varieties of balti are allowed; those varieties are not definitively identified. The colour of the dish changes (either lighter brown or more reddish) depending on which ingredients are added. The additional ingredients and spices may but not have to be added. It is therefore not possible to determine what the final recipe to be followed is.\n\n## See also\nChicken tikka masala\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nCurry Club Balti Curry Cookbook, Piatkus, London — ISBN 0-7499-1214-6 & ISBN 0-7499-1342-8 (1993)\nrepublished as  Modern Balti Curries, John Blake Publishing, London (2006)\nPat Chapman's Balti Bible, Hodder & Stoughton, London — ISBN 0-340-72858-2 & ISBN 0-340-72859-0 (1998)\n2009 Cobra Good Curry Guide, John Blake Publishing, London — ISBN 1-84454-311-0\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Bangladeshi cuisine\n\nBangladeshi cuisine has been shaped by the region's history and river-line geography. Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate. The staple foods of Bangladesh are rice and fish. The majority of Bangladeshi people are ethnic Bengali, with a minority of non-Bengalis, many used to cuisines from different traditions and regions.\n\n## History\nBangladeshi culinary habits were strongly influenced by the cuisine and culture of the area's history of Mughal rulers. Dhaka was the Mughal capital of the Bengal Subah and a major trading center in South Asia. Traders, immigrants and visitors brought culinary styles from around the world, which influenced the city's cuisine. After Dhaka became the capital of East Bengal, Persian, Turkish and Arabic-influenced dishes became popular. Black pepper and chui jhal were used to add spiciness before  chili was introduced from the Americas.\n\n## Culinary style and influences\nRice is the staple food of Bangladesh, while fish is the most common source of protein in Bangladesh. There are 250 plant-based ingredients in Bangladeshi cooking. The use of mustard oil is common.\n\n## Specialties by region\n\n\n### Dhaka\nThe culinary customs of the nation's capital have been influenced by Mughlai, Central Asian, Armenian, Persian and native Bengali cuisines. The city's cuisine  also has unique local dishes.\nThe Nawabs of Dhaka brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal. Mughlai cuisine is often lavish and expensive, and was out of reach for many people up for many centuries, becoming more widespread as Bangladesh's economy grew. It is characterised by use of meat and dairy ingredients such as lamb, goat, beef, and yogurt together with mild spices. Its dishes include kebab; stuffed breads; kacchi biriyani; duck, and chicken; patisapta; Kashmiri tea and korma are still served at special occasions like Eid and at weddings.\nChowk Bazaar in Old Dhaka is a centuries-old food market and a focal point during Ramadan for the Iftar meal after sunset.\n\nDhakaiya paratha is a multi-layered bread that found popularity in Kolkata when immigrants from Dhaka introduced it there following the Partition of India.\n\nHaji biryani is a rice dish originating from a Dhaka restaurant of the same name. The dish consists of rice, goat meat and spices.\nBakarkhani is a thick, spiced flat-bread from  Mughlai cuisine often served with tea. Dhakai Bakarkhani is the variant found in Dhaka, where it has been prepared for centuries.\nMorog pulao is a signature dish of the city, an aromatic rice pilaf with chicken.\n\n### Chittagong Division\nIn Chittagong and the surrounding region curries are generally highly spiced and often include beef. Mejbani Gosht is a beef curry for special occasions; a Mejban or Mezban is a communal feast.\n\nBeef dishes are popular with Bengali Muslims and often served at Mezban feasts, where they indicate prosperity.\nHindus tend to cook with fish rather than beef. The Hindu community of Chittagong organises Mezban feasts each year as \"Chittagong Parishad\", with curries of fish and vegetables.\nKala bhuna, blackened beef, is a dish from Chittagong made of beef shoulder cooked with spices until  dark and tender.\nDurus kura or duroos is a dish comprising a whole chicken cooked in thick broth, served with rice, either as polao or khichuri.

It contains cubes of beef or goat meat with potatoes and dried fruits.\nChittagong is near the coast and has several dishes using sea fish, including rupchanda (silver pomfret) and loita (Bombay duck). Shutki is cured and dried loita, a pungent delicacy typical of the region. Churi (ribbonfish) is dried then cooked with chili and onions. Koral/bhetki (barramundi) and giant tiger prawns from the Bay of Bengal are eaten in coastal regions.\n\n### Chittagong Hill Tracts\nThe Chittagong Hill Tracts are home to tribes with their own culture and cuisine. Chakma cuisine uses sidol, a paste made from fermented shrimps and fish, and suguni, dried shrimp or fish. Their dishes use more herbs from the hills more than the spices common in Bengali dishes. Important seasonal ingredients include wild mushrooms and the Flowers of ginger and turmeric plants. Sumoh gorang is a dish cooked in bamboo and Hebaang is baked in banana leaves in a mud oven. Marma cuisine uses a paste of dried fish called nappi.

It is home to several citrus fruit varieties such as hatkora and thoikor, Adajamir or Ada Lebu, and Ashkul Lebu or Ashkoni Lebu that are commonly used in the region's fish and meat dishes. Although Ashkul Lebu or Ashkoni Lebu is unheard of amongst many Sylhetis due to lack of knowledge on it, and it is most likely to be nearly extinct; the juices of Ashkul Lebu is used to make Tenga or Khatta.\n\n## Bangladeshi-run restaurants in Great Britain\nIn the early 20th century sailors from Sylhet, known as Lascars, settled in the United Kingdom. They  bought fish and chip restaurants and developed them into full service Indian restaurants. They based the cuisine offered there on that sold by established Anglo-Indian restaurants and on Mughal Cuisine.\nMore than 8 out of 10 of over 8,000 \"Indian restaurants\" in the UK are owned by Bangladeshis, 95% of who come from Sylhet.\n\nThe culinary historian Lizzie Collingham wrote that\"Sylheti curry cooks converted \"unadventurous British palates\" to a new flavour spectrum\".\n\n## Sweets\nAmriti is a flower-shaped deep-fried dessert in sugary syrup that is popular in Dhaka and Tangail.\nChomchom is a traditional sweet that originated in Porabari.

Outside its traditional lands in North Sumatra, Batak cuisine can also be found in Lapo in Jakarta, as well as most of the Indonesian major cities. Batak food is also widely present in Penang, Malaysia due to wide Batak migrant labour population found there.\n\n## History\nCooking traditions in many parts of Sumatra often demonstrates foreign culinary influences; such as Minang, Malay and Acehnese cuisines featuring typical curry-like dishes heavily influenced by Indian and Arabic cuisines. Batak cuisine however, retain its indigenous Austronesian cooking traditions; such as cooking meats (especially pork) along with its blood. Similar dish can also be found in Filipino cuisine, such as dinuguan. However, since many tribes of the archipelago have converted to Islam, the non-halal dishes such as those using pork, dog meat, or blood, has been abandoned, and now only survive in  non-Muslim areas, such as Batak lands.\n\n## Spices and flavourings\nRegional differences between Batak and Acehnese culinary influences, among others, are characterized by the choice of spices; curry leaves or andaliman. Coastal Acehnese people using curry leaves (Murraya koenigii) as the main spice, while the Batak people prefer andaliman. Regions that use andaliman as main spices starting from the Gayo highlands in Central Aceh continue to the southeast up to Berastagi in Tanah Karo in North Sumatra.\nThe most widely used spice in  Batak cuisine is andaliman and batak onion (chives), they are commonly used for all types of arsik. The most common Batak spicy sauce is called arsik — it is a Batak sauce made from the mixture of andaliman, turmeric, garlic and candlenut. There are many unique spices used in Batak cuisine recipes. Sambal Tuktuk for example use a mixture of andaliman and other spices. Other spices commonly used in Batak cuisine includes kaffir lime, Indonesian bay leaves, coriander, onion, garlic, chili pepper, pepper, lemongrass, ginger, galangal and turmeric.\n\n## Meat\nFor many centuries Batak tribes has led a relatively isolated way of life and maintained their ancestral belief systems. As the result a lot of the indigenous elements of their culture  still survive, including their culinary arts. Today majority of Batak tribes are Christian, for example Batak Toba, Karo, and Pakpak. Pork and dog meats are commonly consumed. Dog meat is usually called B1, derived from biang, Batak word to refer a dog, while pork is often called B2 from babi. Pork (B2) or dog meat (B1) are usually cooked in its own blood, spiced and seasoned as saksang, or grilled as panggang.\nHowever, there is also Muslim Batak tribes, such as Mandailing Batak tribe. They apply Islamic dietary law which only allows halal food and forbid consumption of pork, dog meat, and blood.\nPopular Batak pork dish are saksang, fried cutlets sauteed pork in thick spicy blood sauces and Babi Panggang Karo (karo roast pork) — often shortened to BPK — which is locals' favourite and has become nationally famous through Lapo Batak restaurants nationwide. BPK consists of roasted pork slices with three accompaniments: a bowl of broth made from the essence of boiled pig's bones, a platter of porcine blood cooked with pepper and chili, and a saucer of extra-hot chili sauce.\nAnother common meat consumed in the Batak cuisine is buffalo meat, beef and chicken. Manuk Napinadar is a grilled chicken smothered in chicken blood itself, spiced with  andaliman and garlic powder. Ayam Tasak Telu is one of popular chicken dish in Batak cuisine. Tasak telu literally means “cooking three times,” and consists of three dishes: the first part is boiled chicken< the second part is a sauce made of finely-ground corn kernels, spices and the remaining stock from the boiled chicken, the third part is an assortment of chopped vegetables and spicy coconut.\n\n## Fish\nSince the Batak tribes live in the interior of North Sumatra, freshwater fish that live in rivers or Lake Toba is commonly consumed by locals. Carp usually cooked as Arsik or Dengke Mas na Niura, the fish is not cooked, but just seasoned and flavored in heavy spices. In addition to carp, catfish and tilapia are also consumed, usually cooked as Na Tinombur.\n\n## Exotic dishes\nBatak dishes sometimes use unusual meats such as dog meat (B1 or \"biang\" ) cooked as saksang or roasted as panggang.\nOne unusual notorious dish is Pagit-pagit that has distinctly pungent aroma. The ingredients include a brew of cassava leaves, santan (coconut milk), rimbang (a bitter but non-toxic variety of the nightshade family), flowers of some locally available plants and some arsik sauce, pork or beef meat, mixed with additional unusual substance — juice from a cow's cud, food that has been digested and regurgitated.\nAnother exotic and rare ingredients is kidu. It is the Karo word for white, plump grubs or insect larvae found in sugar palm trees. The kidu-kidu sausages are named as such because they look similar to the grubs. The grubs are lightly fried to make the outer skin crispy while keeping the inner part juicy, and then briefly cooked in a boiling arsik sauce.\n\n## Beverages\nFor the Batak community, tuak (palm liquor) is not just for drinking binges. The beverage is mandatory at celebrations, and drinking tuak has become something of a tradition. It is a popular traditional alcoholic beverage made from palm wine. It is made by fermenting the enau sap. Batak Lapo Tuak is a drinking establishment dedicated to serve this traditional alcoholic beverage. North Sumatra is also known as coffee production area in Indonesia. Coffee variants such as Mandheling is those coffee beans grown in North Sumatran Mandailing region.\n\n## Dishes\nSaksang\nArsik\nPanggang\nAyam Tasak Telu\nManuk Napinadar\nTanggotanggo\nDengke Mas na Niura\nNa Tinombur\nMie gomak\nNa Nidugu\nDali ni Horbo\nSambal Tuktuk\nPagit-pagit\nDaun ubi tumbuk\n\n## Snacks\nItak Gurgur\nKue Pohulpohul\nKue Ombusombus\nKue Lampet\nKue Benti\nTipatipa\nKacang Sihobuk\nSasagun\nBika Ambon\n\n## See also\nIndonesian cuisine\nMinangkabau cuisine\nPalembang cuisine\nJavanese cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Batak cuisine at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Bengali cuisine\n\nBengali cuisine is the culinary style of Bengal, comprising now most of Bangladesh and parts of India (i.e., West Bengal and Barak Valley). The cuisine has been shaped by the region's diverse history and climate. It is known for its varied use of flavours including mustard oil, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts. There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple, with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are preferred to marine fish, although barramundi, known as bhetki, is also common. Meat is also a common protein among Bengalis, with chicken and mutton being the most popular. Beef is popular within the Muslim community.However meat from any sources is consumed far less than fish in Bangladesh. In more recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of the diet. Many Bengali food traditions draw from religious and social functions, such as adda, Poila Boishakh, Eid, and Durga Puja.\n\n## Culinary influences\n\n\n### Mughal influence\nMuslims conquered Bengal around the mid-thirteenth century, bringing with them Persian and Arabic cuisine. Such dishes as korma and bhuna had once been meals of the higher courts, but the cooks of the Mughals brought their recipes to the lower and middle classes. The influence was reinforced during the rule of the British Raj, where Kolkata became the place of refuge for many prominent exiled Nawabs, notably the family of Tipu Sultan from Mysore and Wajid Ali Shah, the ousted Nawab of Awadh. The exiles brought with them hundreds of cooks and masalchis (spice mixers), and as their royal patronage and wealth diminished, they became interspersed into the local population. These cooks came with the knowledge of a very wide range of spices (most notably jafran and mace), the extensive use of ghee, and marinating meat with yoghurt and chilli.\n\nIn Bangladesh, this food has become common fare for the population while in West Bengal, they have remained the food of professional chefs. Further innovations include chap (ribs slow cooked on a tawa), rezala (meat in a thin yogurt and cardamom gravy) and kathi roll (kebabs in a wrap).\nThe Mughals had a particular fixation on meat, bringing mutton and beef into mainstream Bengali cuisine as well as already known kinds of meat like chicken and venison.\nFurthermore, traditional desserts had been primarily based on rice pastes and jaggery, but under Mughal influence moved towards significantly increased use of milk, cream, and sugar along with expensive spices such as cardamom and saffron.\n\n### Influence of Bengali Hindu widows\nIn Bengali Hindu tradition, widows were not allowed to eat foods that would not be classified as \"bitter\", necessitating experiment and innovation. While most Bengali castes ate meat and fish, this was barred for widows. Widows also could not use \"heating\" foods such as shallot and garlic, but ginger was allowed. This style found a core place in Bengali curries in general, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Expensive spices such as saffron, cinnamon or cloves were used very sparingly—if at all. Nuts, dry fruits, milk and milk products (such as cream, ghee or curd) were similarly scarce. These economic and social restrictions influenced Bengali widows to create a brand new set of meals that utilised only vegetables and cheap spices.\n\n### Partition of Bengal\nThe large-scale displacement along religious lines as a result of the partition led to changes in meal-taking, so as to adhere to religious restrictions. In Bangladesh (former East Bengal and East Pakistan), Mughlai food is common, and includes foods that are less popular in West Bengal, such as beef kebab. Additionally, sweets such as zarda and firni-payesh are eaten. In rural Bangladesh, many people eat makna fried, popped, or raw.\nDuring the colonial period, many Western food shops were established in Kolkata, making puff pastries, channa, chocolate, and chips especially popular. Dishes such as chop, gravy cutlet, sponge rasogolla, and ledikeni. As a result of a multi-cultural community, Kolkata city's cuisine continuously changes, and takes heavy influence from Chinese and European palates.\n\n## Characteristics\nBengali cuisine can be subdivided into four different types of dishes: eatables (খাদ্য, ভক্ষ্য, or ভোজ্য); চর্ব্য, chôrbyô, or chewables, such as rice or fish; চোষ্য, choshyô, or suckables, such as ambal and tak; লেহ্য, lehyô, or lickables, like chutney; and পেয়, peyô, or drinkables which includes drinks, mainly milk.\n\n## Regional specialties\nDifferent parts of Bengal are famed for certain dishes, food items and ingredients. For example, South Bengali districts around the Sundarbans boast of the expensive chui jhal chilli, which they peel and chop into small pieces to be cooked in their dishes and give off a strong aroma. On the other hand, North Bengal  are the homes of many Bengali desserts such as the Mishti doi of Bogra, the Kachagolla of Natore and the Chomchom of Porabari. However, other regions also have famous desserts like the Balish Mishti (pillow-sweet) of Netrokona, the Monda of Muktagachha, the Red Yoghurt of Nabadwip and the famed Roshmolai of Comilla.\n\n### Chittagong\nChittagonian Bengali culinary tradition is mostly known for Mezban and mixed rice dishes like kala bhuna, which has shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices. Dried fish (shutki) is more available in the Chittagong region than in other parts of Bengal.\n\n### Dhaka\nDhakaiya food is one of the most notable regional Bengali cuisines. The rich culinary customs are influenced by Mughlai, Central Asian, Armenian, Hindustani and native Bengali cuisines. However, it also has dishes unique to Dhaka. The Nawabs of Dhaka had brought Mughlai cuisine to Bengal, that were wholly retained by Dhaka's culinary community. Due to the high costs of producing Mughlai food, the recipes were limited to the elite classes in colonial India, and slowly expanded as Bangladesh's economy grew. The main focus on lamb, mutton, beef, yoghurt, and mild spices define the taste of the style. Such dishes as kebab; stuffed breads; kacchi biriyani; roast lamb, duck, and chicken; patisapta; Kashmiri tea; and korma are still served at special occasions like Eid and weddings. Due to the high class of the food, using an excess amount of expensive ingredients like ghee, and making the food melt in one's mouth were essential to the feel of the food.\nOld Dhaka boasts a variation of the famous pilaf - the Morog Polao - in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Other polaos include ilish polao and rui polao. Dhakaiyas are noted for introducing paneer and boiled eggs to khichuri. Dhakai bakarkhani is a thick, biscuit-like flat-bread which is a traditional street-food snack, famed for its quality and taste. It is mainly dished up with tea. Dhakaiyas proudly hold a heritage of creating the best khili paan using various herbs and spices. They also offer a khili paan for diabetic patients called the \"paan afsana\". Haji biryani is a dish, invented by a restaurateur in 1939, made with highly seasoned rice, goat's meat and number of spices and nuts. The restaurant has become an integral part of Dhakaiya culture.\n\n### Kolkata\nIn Kolkata, many local street vendors own small shops from which they sell their own homemade goods. Items like cheeses (paneer) can be eaten as is, or can be made into sweet sandesh, rosomalai, rosogolla, or chanar payesh. Milk is especially used in Kolkata's various types of payesh, differing in use of different grains and additives like dates, figs, and berries. In addition to European foodstuffs like chocolate, Kolkata takes culinary influence from its Chinese diaspora, most prominently seen in Indian Chinese cuisine. Phuchka, known the rest of India as panipuri, is a common kind of Bengali street food made with a fried dough casing and a potato and chickpea filling, usually found in small stalls alongside bhelpuri, masala chai, ghugni and chaat stalls.\n\n### Sylhet\nSylhet boasts a variation of the famous pilaf dish – Akhni polao – in which the rice is cooked after and the chicken pieces are cut. Commonly consumed varieties of meat include beef, chicken, mutton and duck/goose in dishes such as Hash O Bash. They also proudly hold the heritage of Beef Hatkora, a rice dish consisting of a wild citrus fruit not found in other parts of Bengal.\nDuring the British period, biscuits and loaves were introduced in Sylhet and received popularity within the Muslim community. The middle-class Hindus of Cachar and Sylhet however were very suspicious of biscuits and breads as they believed they were baked by Muslims. In one occasion, a few Hindus in Cachar caught some Englishman eating biscuits with tea which caused an uproar. The information reached the Hindus of Sylhet and a little rebellion occurred. In response to this, companies started to advertise their bread as \"machine-made\" and \"untouched by (Muslim) hand\" to tell Hindus that the breads were \"safe for consumption\". This incident is mentioned in Bipin Chandra Pal's autobiography and he mentions how gradually culinary habits of Hindus eventually changed.\n\n## Utensils\nBengali food is often served on plates which have a distinct flowery pattern often in blue or pink. Another characteristic of Bengali food is the use the boti (also called dao or da). It is a long curved blade on a platform held down by one or both feet; both hands are used to hold whatever is being cut and move it against the blade, which faces the user. This method gives effective control over the cutting process, and can be used to cut anything from prawns to large pumpkins.\nA korai is a cooking vessel for most Bengali sauces and stir-fry. The dekchi (a flat-bottomed pan) is used generally for larger amounts of cooking or for making rice. It comes with a thin flat lid which is used also to strain out the starch while finishing up cooking rice. The tawa is used to make roti and paratha. The other prominent cooking utensil is a hari, which is a round-bottomed pot-like vessel. The three mentioned vessels all come in various sizes and in various metals and alloys.\nA flat metal spatula, khunti, is used often, along with hata (scoop with a long handle), jhanjri (round-shaped sieve-like spatula to deep-fry food), the shanrashi (pincers to remove vessels from the fire), the ghuntni (wooden hand blender) for puréeing dal, the wooden belun chaki (round pastry board and rolling pin), and the shil nora, which is a rough form of a mortar and pestle or grinding stone. The kuruni is used only to grate coconuts.\nSilverware is not a part of traditional Bengali cookery.\n\n### Historical\nBengalis usually eat sitting on the floor with food served on a dostorkhan. They historically ate without silverware, with a large banana or plantain leaf serving as the plate, or with plates made from dried sal leaves sewn together.\nIt is customary to offer guests food and drink appropriate to the time of their visit. At meals, guests are served first, with the possible exception of very old or very young members of the host family. Within the family, serving starts with the senior males (those of highest social rank or eldest). School-age children are served before wives, daughters-in-law, and the cook, who are the last to eat.\n\n### Contemporary\nPrior to colonisation, adherence to meal order was a marker of social status, but with British and Portuguese influence and the growth of the middle class, this has slowly disappeared. Courses are frequently skipped or combined with everyday meals. Meals were usually served course by course to the diners by the youngest housewives, but increasing influence of nuclear families and urbanisation has replaced this. It is common to place everything on platters in the centre of the table, and each diner serves themselves. Ceremonial occasions such as weddings used to have elaborate serving rituals, but professional catering and buffet-style dining is now commonplace. However, large family occasions and more lavish ceremonial feasts may still abide by these rules.\n\n## Meals\nDaily meals are usually simple, geared to balance nutrition and making extensive use of vegetables. The courses progress broadly from lighter to richer and heavier and go through various tastes and taste cleansers. Rice remains common throughout the meal and is the main constituent of the meal, until the chaţni (chutney) course.\n\n### Main course\n\n\n### Sweets\nBengali sweets have a long history. The Portuguese friar Sebastien Manrique, travelling in the region in the 17th century, noted the multitude of milk-based foods and sweets prepared in traditional ways. Falooda, shahi jilapi and shemai are popular sweet foods and desserts.\n\n## Beverages\nCommon beverages include shorbot, lachhi, ghol, matha, falooda and Rooh Afza. The two main types of Bengali tea are dudh cha (milk tea) and masala cha. Srimangal, the tea capital of Bengal, is famed for seven-color tea, whilst Dhaka is famed for borhani. Traditional fruit juices (rosh) are also drunk, such as sugarcane juice, mango juice, palm fruit juice, and date juice, as well as basil seed- and tukma-based drinks.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nBangladeshi cuisine\nList of Bangladeshi dishes\nList of Bengali spices\nChaunk\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nRay, Krishnendu (2004).

    "text": "# Betawi cuisine\n\nBetawi cuisine is rich, diverse and eclectic, in part because the Betawi people that create them were composed from numbers of regional immigrants that came from various places in the Indonesian archipelago, as well as Chinese, Indian, Arab, and European traders, visitors and immigrants that were attracted to the port city of Batavia (today modern Jakarta) since centuries ago.\n\n## History and influences\nBetawi cuisine developed and evolved with influences from various cuisine traditions brought by waves of newcomers to the port city on the north coast of Western Java. From the small port of Sunda Kalapa, it grew into an active hub of international trade, primarily involving Indonesian, Chinese, Indian and Arab traders. By the early 16th century, drawn by the spice trade, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive, followed by the Dutch later in the same century. During colonial VOC era, foreign communities were kept in enclaves under Dutch colonial rule; as the result the culinary concentration grew in each area: Tanah Abang for Arab cuisine, the Glodok and Kuningan area for Chinese food, and Tugu in North Jakarta for Portuguese.\nBetawi cuisine is in fact similar to Peranakan cuisine, as both are hybrid cuisines heavily influenced by Chinese and Malay, as well as Arab and European, cuisines, to neighboring Sundanese and Javanese cuisine. Nasi uduk, for example, a savory rice cooked in coconut milk and served with several side dishes, may be a local version of the Malay dish nasi lemak. Asinan, cured and brined pickled vegetables, and rujak juhi, vegetables served with shredded dried squid and peanut sauce, demonstrate Chinese influences. Because of this common heritage, some of Betawi cuisines, such as asinan and lontong cap go meh, are shared with Chinese Indonesian. Betawi cuisine also shares some recipes and dishes with neighboring Sundanese, such as both of them are familiar with sayur asem, gado-gado (lotek) and semur jengkol. Another examples are nasi kebuli and soto betawi that uses minyak samin (ghee), which indicates Arab or Muslim Indian influences.\nA gastronomy expert suggests that some Betawi dishes can describes the past condition of Betawi people reside in Batavia. For example, kerak telor was created due to the low quality of local glutinous rice, with the egg and other toppings added to make it more tasty and satisfying. Soto tangkar, which today is a meat soup, was mostly made from the broth of goat rib-cage bones in the past because meat was expensive, or the common population of Batavia were too poor to afford some meat back then.\nToday, many authentic Betawi dishes are hard to find even in its native land. This is partly because as a cosmopolitan city, Jakarta also features dishes from many far-flung parts of Indonesia, as well as international cuisines — which is a myriad dishes for Betawi cuisine to compete with. Moreover, Betawi community were pushed out of the inner city to the marginal suburbs in and around Greater Jakarta in the wave of development. Nevertheless, some Betawi restaurants are striving to preserve their heritage cuisine, such as rare gabus pucung, and pecak gabus, snakehead fish (Channa striata) in pecak sauce.\n\n## Ingredients and cooking method\nBetawi cuisine uses rice as staples, numbers of its dishes are revolved around rice, either steamed, cooked in coconut milk as nasi uduk (coconut rice), or compressed as ketupat sayur or lontong sayur rice cakes in vegetables soup. As a Muslim-majority community, Betawi people favour beef, mutton and goat meat, as they adhere to Islamic halal dietary-law which forbid pork consumption. Fishes are consumed too. Unusual for a coastal city, there are hardly any seafood dishes in Betawi cuisine. But there are plenty of freshwater fish dishes, using local varieties of snakehead fish and carp. \nPopular Betawi dishes include soto betawi (beef offals in milky broth), sayur asem (sweet and sour vegetable soup), sop iga sapi (beef rib soup) and kerak telor (spiced coconut omelette). Most of Betawi dishes are cooked in deep-fried, stir-fried, barbecued or braised methods, and feature a delicate balance of sweet, sour and salty flavours.\n\n## Dishes\nAsinan betawi, a salad made from a mix of pickled vegetables, yellow noodles and sweet, sour and spicy peanut sauce, topped with a handful of rice crackers\nBakcang, glutinous rice stuffed with meat and wrapped in bamboo leaf in triangular (more precisely, tetrahedral) form\nBubur ayam (lit. chicken congee), rice congee with shredded chicken meat served with condiments and cakwe\nEmpal, sweet and spicy fried beef\nGado-gado, boiled or blanched vegetables salad in peanut sauce\nKerak telor (lit. egg crust), a glutinous rice cake cooked with egg and served with shredded coconut and a dried shrimp topping\nKetoprak, vegetables, tofu, rice vermicelli and rice cake in peanut sauce\nKetupat, rice dumpling made from rice packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch\nKetupat sayur, ketupat compressed rice cake in spicy vegetables in thin coconut milk soup\nLontong, pressed rice cake (dumpling) inside banana wrapping\nLontong cap go meh, lontong in rich coconut milk with chicken opor ayam, liver in chilli, sayur lodeh, and telur pindang (marbled egg)\nLontong sayur, almost identical to ketupat sayur, but uses lontong instead\nLaksa betawi, a Betawi laksa—the thick yellowish coconut milk based soup is a mixture of spices contains ground rebon or ebi (dried small shrimp), ketupat, vegetables, boiled egg, sprinkled with bawang goreng and often topped with emping cracker.\nMi kangkung (lit. water spinach noodles), noodles with water spinach\nNasi biryani, Betawi-style biryani—flavoured rice cooked or served with vegetables, mutton or chicken meat\nNasi goreng domba, spicy fried rice with mutton meat, cooked in ghee\nNasi goreng kambing, spicy fried rice with goat meat, cooked in ghee\nNasi kebuli, Arab-origin spicy steamed rice cooked in goat broth, milk and ghee; similar to kabsa\nNasi mandi, rice served with either roasted chicken, lamb or other meat.\nNasi tim, steamed chicken rice served with chicken broth soup\nNasi uduk, rice cooked in coconut milk, served with assortment of side dishes according to customer's choice; from eggs (hard boiled or omelette), tempeh, anchovy, to fried empal beef and fried chicken.\nNasi ulam, rice with vegetables with side dishes.\nPecak gabus, spiced snakehead fish\nPerkedel, fried patties, made of ground potatoes, minced meat, peeled and ground corn or tofu, or minced fish.\nPesmol, spiced fish dish, usually carp or milkfish.\nPindang bandeng, milkfish cooked in dark color, sweet and sour soup.\nPindang serani, a fish dish with vegetables from Marunda.\nRoti buaya (lit. crocodile bread), crocodile-shaped bread.\nRoti gambang (lit. xylophone bread), rectangular shaped brown bread with sesame seeds, flavored with cinnamon and palm sugar.

They are often served as a breakfast item or a snack, and also used in other food preparations (such as dahi vada, vada pav, and doubles).\n\n## History\nAccording to K. T. Achaya, Vadai (Vada) finds mention in Sangam literature during 100 BCE – 300 CE. A type of vada is mentioned as \"vataka\" in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. In this recipe, mung beans are soaked, de-skinned, and ground to a paste. The paste is shaped into balls and deep-fried. Early literature from the present-day states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also mentions bara (vada) and mungaura (a vada made from mung).\nMany immigrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrated to places such as Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, South Africa, Mauritius, and Fiji in the mid-19th century to the early 20th century as indentured laborers. Bara became an important part of the Indian cuisine in these countries. In Trinidad and Tobago, bara became a component of one of their most famous street foods, called doubles. Doubles is served with two baras filled with curried channa and topped with various chutneys or achars. Many South Indians also migrated to these countries and brought their version of vada. For example, in Guyana it is known as Madrasi bara or waday to distinguish it from the North Indian bara.\n\n## Preparation\nVada may be made from legumes, sago or potatoes. Commonly used legumes include pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram and green gram. Vegetables and other ingredients are added to improve taste and nutritive value.\nFor legume-based vadas, the legumes (dal) are soaked with water, and then ground to a batter. The batter is then seasoned with other ingredients, such as cumin seeds, onion, curry leaves (sometimes previously sauteed), salt, chillies or black pepper grains. Often ginger and baking soda are added to the seasoning in shops to increase the fluffy texture and improve fermentation for large batches. The mixture is then shaped and deep-fried, resulting in vadas with a crispy skin and fluffy centre. The preparation of kalmi vadas involves cutting the resulting product into pieces and re-frying them.\n\n## Varieties\nThe various types of vadas include:\n\nMedu vada, made with urad dal (black gram) flour. This vada is shaped like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. It is the most common vada type throughout South India and the most recognisable throughout India. It is also known as ulundhu vadai, uddina vade, minapa vada (Telugu) and  uzhunnu vada.\nMasala vada, made with toor dal (whole lentils) and shaped roughly like a disk. It is also referred to as aamai vadai in Tamil due to its resemblance to a tortoise. Other names include masala vade (Kannada) and parippu vada (Malayalam).  Paruppu vada is made with yellow split peas, green chillies, whole red chillies, onions and salt.\nMaddur vade, an onion vada unique to the state of Karnataka. It is especially well known in the Maddur town of Karnataka and has a different taste from any other vada types. It is typically larger than other vada types and is flat, crispy (to the point of breaking when flexed), and without a hole in the middle. It started as a snack at the Maddur railway station on the Bengaluru–Mysuru railway line. Maddur was the halfway mark on this line and most trains would stop there with passengers buying this snack.\nAmbode, made from split chickpeas without the seed coat, i.e. kadale bele in Kannada.\nMosaru vade, made by cooking a vada normally, and then serving the vada in a mix of dahi (yogurt) and spices.\nEerulli bajji, also known as uli vada (Malayalam): made with onion. It is roughly round-shaped, and may or may not have a hole in the middle.\nRava vada, made of semolina.\nBonda, made with potatoes, garlic and spices coated with lentil paste and fried. In some regions, a bonda is considered a distinct snack food, and is not held to be a type of vada.\nSabudana vada is another variety of vada common in Maharashtra, made from pearl sago.\nThavala vada, a vada made with different types of lentils.\nKeerai vada (spinach vada) is made with spinach-type leaf vegetables along with lentils.\nBatata vada (potato vada). Often served in the form of vada pav, with a bun (known as a pav) and chutney; common street food in Maharashtra, especially in Mumbai.\nKeema vada, a vada made from minced meat, typically smaller and more crisp than other vada types with no hole in the middle.\nVada curry or vada sambhar is a gravy dish that is made with prepared vadas blended with a vegetables in a curry or a gravy format.\nBhajani cha vada: a vada made from a flour made from bajri, jowar, wheat, rice, channa dal, cumin, and coriander seeds; a speciality of Maharashtra.\nDoubles: a snack made with two baras filled with curry channa (curried chickpeas) and various chutneys.\n\n## See also\nAkara\nBagel\nBoortsog\nBurmese fritters, a similar class of fritters in Myanmar\nFalafel\nFried dough foods\nHushpuppy, a similar dish of the Southern United States\nKorokke\nList of doughnut varieties\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Bhutanese cuisine\n\nA staple of Bhutanese cuisine is Bhutanese red rice, which is like brown rice in texture, but has a nutty taste. It is the only variety of rice that grows at high altitudes. Other staples include buckwheat and increasingly maize.\n\n## Regional cuisines\nBuckwheat is eaten mainly in Bumthang, maize in the eastern districts, and rice is eaten across the country. The diet in the hills also includes chicken, yak meat, dried beef, pork, pork fat, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat, rice, fiddleheads, lentils, and dried vegetables, spiced with chili peppers and cheese, are a favorite meal during the cold seasons. Zow shungo is a rice dish mixed with leftover vegetables. Ema datshi is a spicy dish made with large or small green or red chili peppers in a cheesy sauce (similar to chile con queso), which might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that the Bhutanese have for it. Other foods include jasha maru (a chicken dish), phaksha paa (dried pork cooked with chili peppers, spices, and vegetables, including turnips, greens, or radishes), thukpa, puta (buckwheat noodles), bathup, and fried rice.\n\n## Dishes\nBjashamaru: chicken in butter with garlic.\nDāl bhāt (Nepali: दाल भात): a Nepali traditional dish, also popular in Bhutan, especially the south, consisting of steamed rice and dal (pulses).\nEma datshi (Dzongkha: ཨེ་མ་དར་ཚིལ་; Wylie: e-ma dar-tshil): a stew of hot chili peppers and cheese, and the national dish of Bhutan.\nGondomaru: scrambled eggs and cheese in butter.\nMomos: steamed dumplings, also a part of Nepali and Tibetan cuisine.\nNoshahuentsu: pork and spinach.\nPhagshaphintshom: pork in rice noodles.\nPhagshaphu: pork, radishes, and chilies.\nSicum paa: dried pork with chilies.\nTsampa (Tibetan: རྩམ་པ་, Wylie: rtsam pa): a Tibetan porridge.\n\n## Snacks\nPopular snacks include momo (Bhutanese dumplings), Hoentay (Buckwheat dumplings), shakam Ezay (eezay), khabzey (dried fritters made with flour, water, and sugar, which are then deep-fried), shabalay, juma (Bhutanese sausages marinated in spices), and noodles.\n\n## Foreign influences\nRestaurants in the country can serve Chinese, Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian foods, which are very popular and in recent years Korean restaurants have opened due to the increasing popularity of Korean popular culture in the country.\n\n## Dairy and beverages\nDairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and most milk is turned into butter and cheese. Cheese made from cow's milk called datshi is a traditional cottage cheese and widely consumed in Bhutan. Mature datshi, made in the Eastern districts, is known as zoetay, and is normally greenish in colour and has a strong smell.\nA hardened yak milk cheese, chhurpi (or chugo), is produced in small cubes. Chhurpi is incredibly popular and is chewed or sucked throughout the day, especially in rural areas. It is one of the hardest cheeses in the world.\nOther types of cheese include Western types like cheddar and gouda. Western cheese is made in the Swiss Cheese Factory in Jakar or imported from India. Popular beverages include butter tea prepared using tea leaves, salt and butter (suja), milk tea (ngaja), black tea, locally brewed ara (rice wine), and beer. Spices include curry, cardamom, ginger, thingay (Sichuan pepper), garlic, turmeric, and caraway.\n\n## Etiquette\nWhen offered food, one says meshu meshu, covering one's mouth with the hands in refusal according to Bhutanese manners, and then gives in on the second or third offer.\n\n## See also\nDal\nTsheringma tea\nYak butter\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nRennie, Frank; Mason, Robin (2008.)

Biryani is the most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, is used in weddings and celebrations throughout the region, and has been described as the most popular dish in India.\n\n## Etymology\nThe word biryani (Hindi: बिरयानी, Urdu: بریانی) is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: بریان), which means \"to fry\" or \"to roast\", said by Merriam-Webster probably to be related to Sanskrit: भृज्जति bhṛjjati with the same meaning. The usage is from the Persian phrase birinj biryan (with Persian: برنج birinj, \"rice\"), meaning \"fried rice\".\n\n## Origin\n\n\n### Historical sources\nPilau (Persian: پلو 'plo', \"rice\") is a Persian rice dish, attested by the polymath and physician Avicenna in 10th century Persia.\nThe Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari (written 1589–1596), from the time of the emperor Akbar, mentions both pilau and biryani, listing ingredients with required quantities for each:\n\nSecondly, [dishes] in which meat and rice, &c., are used ... 2. Duzdbiryán. 10 s[eer] rice, 3½ s. g'hí; 10 s. meat; ½ s. salt: this gives five dishes. 3. Qimah Paláo. Rice and meat as in the preceding; 4 s. g'hí; 1 s. peeled gram; 2 s. onions; ½ s. salt; ¼ s. fresh ginger, and pepper; cuminseed, cardamums and cloves, 1 d[han]. of each: this gives five dishes.\nThe Ain-i-Akbari further names a dish of spiced mutton as a biryani, this time without mentioning rice: \n\nThirdly, meats with spices... Biryán. For a whole Dashmandi sheep, take 2 s[eer] salt; 1 s[eer] g'hí; 2 m[āshā] saffron, cloves, pepper, cuminseed: it is made in various ways.\"\n\nThe Portuguese priest Sebastien Manrique described rice dishes on sale in the tent-city of the next Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as he travelled to Lahore in 1641. Manrique distinguished \"Persian\" pilau from \"Mogol\" biryani: \n\nAmong these dishes the principal and most substantial were the rich and aromatic Mogol Bringes [biryanis] and Persian pilaos of different hues\". \nThe dish is mentioned, too, in letters of the emperor Aurangzeb to his son. For example:\n\nExalted son, I remember the savour of your 'khichidi' and 'biryani' during the winter. Truly the 'kabuli' cooked by Islam Khan does not surpass them (in point of relish and savour). I wanted to have from you (in my service) Saliman, who cooks 'biryani'; but you did not allow him to serve as my cook. If you happen to find a pupil of his, skilful in the art of cookery, you will send him to me.\nAccording to the historian Rana Safvi, the earliest actual recipe is from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time.\n\n### Analysis\nThe historian of food Lizzie Collingham writes that the modern biryani developed in India (Hindustan) in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire, specifically during the rule of the emperor Akbar (1556–1605), and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia, Persian yoghurt-marinated meat, and the Persian pilau style of garnished rice.  Collingham writes that \"in the kitchens [of the Mughal court]... the delicately flavoured Persian pilau met the pungent and spicy rice dishes of Hindustan to create the classic Mughlai dish, biryani\". \nThe cookery writer Pratibha Karan states that biryani is of Indian origin, derived from pilau which Muslim traders and invaders brought with them. She speculates that pilau was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking.\nIn the view of the historian of Islamic cuisine Salma Hussein and others, biryani came to South Asia from Persia before the Mughal era, most probably arriving in South India's Deccan region, brought by travelling soldier-statesmen and pilgrims. It has also been suggested that the dish was introduced from Persia by the Mughals. Another variant theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native region of Central Asia during that period.\nThe historian of food K. T. Achaya states that pilau is \"of older usage in India\" than biryani, indicating that it could have been a precursor of biryani. Achaya notes that ancient and early medieval Indian texts described rice cooked with meat and spices, suggesting that composite rice dishes were part of the subcontinent’s cuisine long before the Mughal period.He further references early Tamil literature from the Sangam era (circa 300 BCE–300 CE), describing a dish known in these sources as ūn sōru—rice cooked with meat, ghee, and spices—which bears structural similarities to later layered rice preparations.\nThe translator and cookery author Colleen Taylor Sen argues that layered rice dishes developed in India through a gradual process of culinary refinement, particularly in regional courts and aristocratic households. According to Sen, while Indo-Islamic courts contributed to the dish's elaboration, the adaptation of local rice varieties, indigenous spices, and region-specific cooking methods suggest a strong Indian foundation in its evolution.\n\n## Ingredients\nIngredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (chicken, goat, beef) is the prime ingredient with rice. Seafood (fish, prawns) and vegetables are sometimes added. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, sultanas (kishmish), and fruits such as apple and pineapple.\nThe spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, star anise, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron. Some commercial recipes for biryani include aromatic essences such as mitha attar, kewra and rose water. Dried sour prunes (alu bukhara) may be added. In nasi briyani and other variants made in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, local spices and aromatics such as pandan leaf may be added.\nBiryani may be served with side dishes such as raita (yoghurt with cucumber, tomato, etc), fried or curried aubergine (brinjal), salad, or a curried side such as ande ka salan (with boiled eggs) or mirchi ka salan (with chili peppers).\nDietary variations include adding eggs, potatoes, and substituting meat with paneer or vegetables, especially in Hindu or non-religious vegetarian variants. Kolkata biryani, invented by Wajid Ali Shah in the 1850s, includes potato.\n\n## Preparation styles\n\n\n### Pakki and kacchi biryani\nBiryani can be cooked using one of two techniques, pakki (\"cooked\") and kacchi (\"raw\"). In a pakki biryani, the ingredients are cooked separately (at least in part) and then arranged in layers. The different layers can be individually coloured and flavoured with a brightly-coloured spice such as turmeric or saffron. In a kacchi biryani, layers are arranged in a pot which is then sealed and cooked slowly (Dum cooking) for the food to steam in its own liquid.\n\n### Difference between biryani and pilau\nPilau is a mixed rice dish popular in the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, and Middle Eastern cuisine. Opinions differ on the differences between the dishes, if any. \nThe British-era author Abdul Halim Sharar mentions that biryani has a stronger curried taste due to a greater amount of spices. According to Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi, pilau tends to be plainer than biryani, and consists of meat or vegetables cooked with rice with the bottom layered with potatoes or onions. Biryani contains more gravy, and is often cooked longer, leaving the meat (and vegetables, if present) more tender, and the rice more flavoured. Biryani is cooked with additional dressings and often has a light layer of scorched rice at the bottom.\nThe cookery author Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (and vegetables, if present) in the middle, while the pilau is not layered. Further, in modern usage, biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while pilau is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal; and biryanis have more complex and stronger spices than pilaus.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n### In the Indian subcontinent\nThere are many types of biryani in the Indian subcontinent. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish in Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been described as the most popular dish in India. The names of variants are often based on their region or city of origin. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, as in Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka, Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai. Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities. \nIn 2009, the Deccani Biryani Makers Association submitted 'Hyderabadi Biryani' for a geographical indication, but the attempt failed as they were unable to provide documentary evidence of its historical origin.\n\n### Outside the Indian subcontinent\nVarieties of biryani have arisen in many countries, and was often spread to such places by South Asian diaspora populations. For example in Myanmar, danpauk (ဒံပေါက်) is a mainstay at festive events such as weddings. On the Persian Gulf, biryani (Persian: برياني) is usually saffron-based with chicken, while in Indonesia nasi kebuli is an spicy steamed rice dish cooked in goat meat broth, milk and ghee. In Thailand the dish is known as khao mhok (Thai: ข้าวหมก), using chicken, beef or fish, topped with fried garlic and served with a green sour sauce.\n\n## In culture\nBiryani forms \"the centrepiece of countless Indian holidays and weddings\". In Bangladesh, kacchi biryani with mutton has been described as \"the quintessential wedding dish\" of Old Dhaka, largely replacing the murg (chicken) pulao that was favoured in the 20th century for special occasions across the subcontinent. In Delhi, the Muslim festival of Bakr Eid was marked by biryani at dinner, using the mutton from the goats slaughtered in memory of the prophet Abraham, who had shown he was willing even to sacrifice his own son. \nBiryani is used across the Indian Subcontinent in celebrations. Annual biryani festivals have been held in cities such as Ambur, Islamabad and Karachi. South Asian diaspora populations have held their own festivals, for example by the North American Indian Muslim Association in North America. Biryani festivals have been held more widely in places such as Singapore and Qatar.\n\n## See also\nBannu pulao\nFried rice\nKabuli pulao\nJollof rice\nTehri\nPaella\nList of rice dishes\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Brain as food\n\nThe brain, like most other internal organs, or offal, can serve as nourishment. Brains used for nourishment include those of pigs, squirrels, rabbits, horses, cattle, monkeys, chickens, camels, fish, lamb, and goats. In many cultures, different types of brain are considered a delicacy.\n\n## Cultural consumption\nThe brain of animals features in French cuisine, in dishes such as cervelle de veau and tête de veau. A dish called maghaz is a popular cuisine in Pakistan, Bangladesh, parts of India, and diaspora countries. In Turkish cuisine, brain can be fried, baked, or consumed as a salad. In Chinese cuisine, brain is a delicacy in Chongqing or Sichuan cuisine, and it is often cooked in spicy hot pot or barbecued. In the southern part of China, pig brain is cooked into soup as tianma zhunao tang. In South India, goat brain curry (మేక మెదడు కూర) or fry (మేక మెదడు వేపుడు) is a delicacy. Mumbai has its own version of brain masala curry.\nSimilar delicacies from around the world include the Mexican tacos de sesos. The Anyang tribe of Cameroon practiced a tradition in which a new tribal chief would consume the brain of a hunted gorilla, while another senior member of the tribe would eat the heart. The Minangkabau people in Indonesia prepare  gulai banak 'beef brain curry' in a coconut-milk gravy.  In Cebu City, Philippines, tuslob buwa (fried pig brain) is a popular street food.  In Cuban cuisine, \"brain fritters\" are fried breaded brains.\nIn the Ohio River Valley, fried brain sandwiches are popular, especially in the Evansville, Indiana area.\n\n## By type\n\n\n### Beef brain\nBeef brains and veal (juvenile beef) or calf's brains are used in the cuisines of France; Italy; Spain; El Salvador; Mexico, etc. where they are called sesos in Spanish and are eaten in tacos and quesadillas; Pakistan and Bangladesh also in parts of India like Kolkata and Kerala, where they are known in Urdu and Bengali as Maghaz; Portugal; Egypt, where they are eaten fried and Indonesia.\nCalf's brains (French: cervelle de veau) is a traditional delicacy in Europe and Morocco. It is often served with tongue, sauteed with beurre noir and capers,  or mixed with scrambled eggs. In Italy, cervella fritte is a popular dish made of bite-sized batter-fried morsels of beef brain.\nOutbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad-cow disease) led to legislation to reduce risks of contracting the human variant of the illness by consumption of beef brains and spines.\n\n## Nutritional composition\nDHA, an important omega-3 fatty acid, is found concentrated in mammalian brains.  For example, according to Nutrition Data, 85g (3 oz) of cooked beef brain contains 727 mg of DHA.  By way of comparison, the NIH has determined that small children need at least 150 mg of DHA per day, and pregnant and lactating women need at least 300 mg of DHA.\nThe makeup of the brain is about 12% lipids, most of which are located in myelin (which itself is 70–80% fat). Specific fatty acid ratios will depend in part on the diet of the animal it is harvested from. The brain is also very high in cholesterol. For example, a single 140g (5 oz) serving of \"pork brains in milk gravy\" can contain 3500 mg of cholesterol (1170% of the USRDA).\n\n## Prions\nBeef brain consumption has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease outbreaks in humans which led to strict regulations about what parts of cattle can be sold for human consumption in numerous countries. Another prion disease called kuru has been traced to a funerary ritual among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea in which those close to the dead would eat the brain of the deceased to create a sense of immortality.\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Brain as food at Wikimedia Commons",

This diversity is linked to the origins of the people inhabiting each area.\nFor instance, the cuisine of Bahia is heavily influenced by a mix of African, Indigenous, and Portuguese cuisines. Chili (including chili sauces) and palm oil are very common. In the northern states, however, due to the abundance of forest and freshwater rivers, fish, fruits and cassava (including flours made of cassava) are staple foods. In the deep south, as in Rio Grande do Sul, the influence shifts more towards gaúcho traditions shared with its neighbors Argentina and Uruguay, with many meat-based products, due to this region's livestock-based economy; the churrasco, a kind of barbecue, is a local tradition.\n\n### Center-West Brazil's cuisine\nIn Goiás State, the pequi is used in many typical foods, especially the \"arroz com pequi\" (rice cooked with pequi), and in snacks, mostly as a filling for pastel, in this state is very common the presence of chestnuts, and palm trees. Also, a mixture of chicken and rice known as galinhada is very popular. The states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul received influence from neighboring countries in their cuisine, as well as the Pantanal area and its various rivers and extensive wetlands that cross these two states with a high abundance of fish.\n\n### Southeast Brazil's cuisine\nIn Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, and Minas Gerais, feijoada is popular, especially as a Wednesday or Saturday lunch. Also consumed frequently is picadinho (literally, diced meat) and rice and beans. In Rio de Janeiro, besides the feijoada, a popular plate is any variation of grilled beef fillet, rice and beans, farofa, fried garlic and fried potatoes (batatas portuguesas), commonly called filé à Osvaldo Aranha. Seafood is very popular in coastal areas, as is roasted chicken (galeto). The strong Portuguese heritage also endowed the city with a taste for bolinhos de bacalhau (fried cod fritters), one of the most common street foods there.\nIn São Paulo, a typical dish is virado à paulista, made with rice, virado de feijão (similar to a tutu), sauteed kale, fried plantains or bananas and pork chops. São Paulo is also the home of pastel, a food consisting of thin pastry envelopes wrapped around assorted fillings, then deep-fried in vegetable oil. It is a common belief that they originated when Chinese and Japanese immigrants adapted the recipe of fried spring rolls to sell as snacks at weekly street markets. São Paulo is also known for parmegianna.\nIn Minas Gerais, the regional dishes include corn, pork, beans, chicken (including the very typical dish frango com quiabo, or chicken with okra), tutu de feijão (puréed beans mixed with cassava flour), and local soft-ripened traditional cheeses.\nIn Espírito Santo, there is significant Italian and German influence in local dishes, both savory and sweet. The state dish, though, is of Amerindian origin, called moqueca capixaba, which is a tomato and fish stew traditionally prepared in a panela de Goiabeiras (pot made of clay from Goiabeiras district in Vitória). Amerindian and Italian cuisine are the two main pillars of Capixaba cuisine. Seafood dishes, in general, are very popular in Espírito Santo, but unlike other Amerindian dishes, the use of olive oil is almost mandatory. Bobó de camarão, torta capixaba, and polenta are also very popular.\n\n### Southern Brazil's cuisine\nIn Southern Brazil, due to the long tradition in livestock production and the heavy German immigration, red meat is the basis of the local cuisine.\nBesides many of the pasta, sausage and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, churrasco is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine or Uruguayan asado) which originated in southern Brazil. It contains a variety of meats which may be cooked on a purpose-built churrasqueira, a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. Portable churrasqueiras are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine and Uruguayan asado, with a grill support, but many Brazilian churrasqueiras do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the State of Rio Grande do Sul).\nSince gaúchos were nomadic and lived off the land, they had no way of preserving food; the gauchos would gather together after butchering a cow, and skewer and cook the large portions of meat immediately over a wood-burning fire (not exactly as gauchos also produced charque). The slow-cooked meat basted in its own juices and resulted in tender, flavorful steaks. This style has inspired many contemporary churrascaria which emulates the cooking style where waiters bring large cuts of roasted meat to diners' tables and carve portions to order.\nThe chimarrão is the regional beverage, often associated with the gaúcho image.\nThe most typical dishes of Rio Grande do Sul cuisine are churrasco, chimarrão, arroz carreteiro, fried polenta, galeto, cuca, and sagu, among others. In the region there is a large consumption of wine, grape juice and white grape juice due to the south being the largest grape producer in the country, and artisanal cheeses and salamis. In the region, fig, grape and peach jellies and jams are also very common. One of the most famous is chimia. The consumption of vegetables preserved in water, vinegar, sugar, salt and spices, such as beets and cucumbers, is also typical of the Southern Region.\n\n### Northeast Brazil's cuisine\nThe Northeastern Brazilian cuisine is heavily influenced by African cuisine from the coastal areas of Pernambuco to Bahia, as well as the eating habits of indigenous populations that lived in the region.\nThe vatapá is a Brazilian dish made from bread, shrimp, coconut milk, finely ground peanuts and palm oil mashed into a creamy paste.\nThe bobó de camarão is a dish made with cassava and shrimp (camarão).\nThe acarajé is a dish made from peeled black-eyed peas formed into a ball and then deep-fried in dendê (palm oil). Often sold as street food, it is served split in half and then stuffed with vatapá and caruru. Acarajé is typically available outside of the state of Bahia as well.\nIn other areas, more to the west or away from the coast, the plates are most reminiscent of the indigenous cuisine, with many vegetables being cultivated in the area since before the arrival of the Portuguese. Examples include baião de dois, made with rice and beans, dried meat, butter, queijo coalho and other ingredients. Jaggery is also heavily identified with the Northeast, as it is carne-de-sol, paçoca de pilão, and bolo de rolo.\nTapioca flatbreads or pancakes are also commonly served for breakfast in some states, with a filling of either coconut, cheese or condensed milk, butter, and certain meats. They can also be filled with dessert toppings as well.\n\n### North Brazil's cuisine\nThe cuisine of this region, which includes the states of Acre, Amazonas, Amapá, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins, is heavily influenced by indigenous cuisine. In the state of Pará, there are several typical dishes, including:\nPato no tucupi (duck in tucupi) – one of the most famous dishes from Pará. It is associated with the Círio de Nazaré, a local Roman Catholic celebration. The dish is made with tucupi (yellow broth extracted from cassava, after the fermentation process of the broth remained after the starch had been taken off, from the raw ground manioc root, pressed by a cloth, with some water; if added maniva, the manioc ground up external part, that is poisonous because of the cyanic acid, and so must be cooked for several days). After cooking, the duck is cut into pieces and boiled in tucupi sauce for some time. The jambu is boiled in water with salt, drained, and put on the duck. It is served with white rice and manioc flour and corn tortillas.\n\n## Popular snacks\nSalgadinhos (lit. 'Little salty one') are small savoury snacks. Similar to Spanish tapas, these are mostly sold in corner shops and are a staple at working-class and lower-middle-class family celebrations. There are many types of salgadinhos:\n\nPão de queijo (lit. 'Cheese bread'), a typical Brazilian snack, is a small, soft roll made of manioc flour, eggs, milk, and minas cheese. It can be bought ready-made at a corner store or frozen and ready to bake in a supermarket and is gluten-free.\nCoxinha (lit. 'Little thigh') is a chicken croquette shaped like a chicken thigh.\nPastéis (sing. pastel) are pastries with a wide variety of fillings. Similar to Spanish fried empanadas but of Asian origin (and brought to Brazil by the Chinese diaspora and Japanese diaspora). Different shapes are used to tell apart the different flavours, the two most common shapes being half-moon (cheese) and square (meat). Size, flavour, and shape may vary greatly. They can be filled with various items, the most consumed being those filled with meat, cheese, chicken, heart of palm, without filling (called \"wind pastel\"), shrimp, chocolate with banana and cheese with guava paste.\nBolinhos de bacalhau (lit. 'Little cod cakes') are fried cod fish pastries that are mainly found in Rio de Janeiro, but also in other regions of the country.\nEmpadas are snacks that resemble pot pies in a small scale. They can be filled with various items, the most popular being empadas filled with hearts of palm, shrimp, chicken and cheese.\nQuibe, sometimes spelled Kibe, is a popular salgadinho that was created by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants as an adaption of kibbeh.\nEsfiha, sometimes spelled Esfirra, are pastries that were brought by Arab immigrants and are popular in the state of São Paulo. They are commonly filled with ground beef, cheese, or vegetables.\nOther appetizers that can typically be found in Brazilian territory are: croquette, rissole, coxa-creme, cueca virada, bolinho de aipim (cassava pastries), among others.\n\n## Popular dishes\nBrazilian cuisine is recognized around the world for its variety and quality. The city of São Paulo was chosen as the 7th main gastronomic destination in the world, for its recognized restaurants and bars. This Brazilian city comes after Rome, London, Paris, Dubai, Barcelona and Madrid. The city of São Paulo alone has more than 9,000 restaurants and bars.\n\nRice and beans is an extremely popular dish, considered basic at a table; a tradition Brazil shares with several Caribbean nations. Brazilian rice and beans usually are cooked utilizing either lard or the nowadays more common edible vegetable fats and oils, in a variation of the Mediterranean sofrito locally called refogado which usually includes garlic in both recipes.\nIn variation to rice and beans, Brazilians usually eat pasta (including spaghetti, lasagne, gnocchi, lamen, and bīfun), pasta salad, various dishes using either potato or manioc, and polenta as substitutions for rice, as well as salads, dumplings or soups of green peas, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, broad beans, butter beans, soybeans, lentils, moyashi (which came to Brazil due to the Chinese and Japanese tradition of eating its sprouts), azuki, and other legumes in substitution for the common beans cultivated in South America since Pre-Columbian times. It is more common to eat substitutions for daily rice and beans in festivities such as Christmas and New Year's Eve (the tradition is lentils), as the follow-up of churrasco (mainly potato salad/carrot salad, called maionese, due to the widespread use of both industrial and home-made mayonnaise, which can include egg whites, raw onion, green peas, sweetcorn or even chayote squashes, and pronounced almost exactly as in English and French) and in other special occasions.\nEither way the basis of Brazilian daily cuisine is the starch (most often a cereal), legume, protein and vegetable combination. There is also a differentiation between vegetables of the verduras group, or greens, and the legumes group (no relation to the botanic concept), or non-green vegetables.\nChurrasco is the main dish of southern Brazil. Over time, other regions of Brazil adopted churrasco and created other ways of making it. The restaurant specializing in churrasco is a churrascaria.\nPicanha is a typical Brazilian cut of meat, being the most appreciated by the people of the country.\nFarofa, cooked cassava flour that is served as an accompaniment/condiment. Its crunchiness is especially appreciated.\nBife a cavalo: a steak topped with a fried egg, usually accompanied by French fries and sometimes salad.\nBife à parmegiana: fried steak, consisting of a sliced piece of meat, breaded with wheat flour and eggs (egg whites), topped with parmesan cheese and lots of tomato sauce and seasonings such as oregano to taste. Sometimes parmesan replaces mozzarella slices. Although it is a dish invented in Brazil and typical of Brazilian culture, generally, in the country itself, it is considered an Italian recipe.\nVirado, typical dish from the state of São Paulo, where it is also known as Virado à Paulista, which consists of a pork chop, fried plantain, cassava flour beans, rice, cabbage and fried egg.\nTutu de feijão, typical dish from the state of Minas Gerais, made with boiled beans, sautéed and thickened with cassava or corn flour. It is usually sautéed with pieces of fried bacon, onion and garlic, and mixed with cassava flour or corn flour depending on the type of bean.\nArroz carreteiro is a typical dish from the southern region of Brazil, made from rice to which is added finely chopped and sautéed beef, shredded or minced dried meat or sun-dried meat, sometimes paio, bacon and chorizo. in pieces, sautéed in a lot of fat, with garlic, onion, tomato and parsley, always with a lot of seasoning.\nGalinhada is a typical dish from the states of Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Goiás, which consists of cooked rice and cooked chicken pieces. The seasoning is composed of saffron (which gives the rice the typical yellowish color), vinagrete (optional and to accompany), and bean tutu. The typical Goiás chicken dish contains guariroba (a type of bitter palm) and pequi.\nBarreado is a typical dish of Parana State, Brazil. It is a slow-cooked meat stew prepared in a clay pot whose lid is sealed with a sort of clay made from wheat or cassava flour, hence the name (which means, literally, \"muddied\"). Traditionally, Barreado was made of buffalo meat, but nowadays it is usually made of beef, bacon, tomatoes, onion, cumin and other spices, placed in successive layers in a large clay urn, covered and then \"barreada\" (sealed) with a paste of ash and farinha (manioc flour), and then slowly cooked in a wood-fired oven for 12 to 18 hours. Nowadays pressure cookers and gas or electric ovens are more commonly used.\nPizza is also extremely popular. It is usually made in a wood-fired oven with a thin, flexible crust, little or very little sauce, and a number of interesting toppings. While it is normal for a pizza to be thin and with few ingredients (the \"traditional\" Italian pizza), in Brazil it can have more than 100 flavors, savory (with ingredients such as linguiça calabresa, pepperoni, egg, tomato, poultry (either milled chicken meat or smoked turkey breast), catupiry, Canadian loin, tuna, onion and you can still find pizzas with more exotic flavors such as hamburger, stroganoff or sushi) or sweets (with flavors such as chocolate, banana with cinnamon, goiabada with cheese, fig, with scoops of ice cream, M&Ms, etc.). Traditionally olive oil is poured over the pizza, but in some regions people enjoy ketchup, mustard and even mayonnaise on pizza.\nCachorro quente is the Brazilian version of hot dogs. It is another dish that has been modified in Brazil, practically becoming a complete lunch. There, the most common version is the \"X-Tudo\" (in literal translation, cheese-everything), or \"Podrão\" (in literal translation, \"rotten\", or \"big rotten\" due to the usually excessive amount of food in the dish), where, in addition to conventional bread and sausages with ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise, it is filled with a series of additional ingredients ranging from straw fries, grated Parmesan cheese, corn kernels, peas and olives to quail eggs.\nMisto-quente is grilled ham and cheese sandwich.\nAngu is a popular side dish (or a substitution for rice replacing the \"starch element\" and it is commonly used in Southern and Southeastern Brazil). It is similar to the Italian polenta.\nArroz com pequi is a traditional dish from the Brazilian Cerrado, and the symbol of Center-Western Brazil's cuisine. It is basically made with rice seasoned on pequi, also known as a souari nut, and often chicken.\nCuscuz branco is a dessert consisting of milled tapioca cooked with coconut milk and sugar and is the couscous equivalent of rice pudding.\nAçaí, cupuaçu, carambola, and many other tropical fruits are shipped from the Amazon rainforest and consumed in smoothies or as fresh fruit. Other aspects of Amazonian cuisine are also gaining a following.\nPinhão is the pine nut of the Araucaria angustifolia, a common tree in the highlands of southern Brazil. The nuts are boiled and eaten as a snack in the winter months. It is typically eaten during the festas juninas.\nRisoto (risotto) is an Italian originated rice dish cooked with chicken, shrimp, and seafood in general or other protein staples sometimes served with vegetables, another very popular dish in Southern Brazil due to massive waves of Italian immigration.\nMortadella sandwich is very common in São Paulo due to Italian immigration.\nAlso noteworthy are:\n\nSpecial ethnic foods and restaurants that are frequently found in Brazil include Arab cuisine (Lebanese and Syrian), local variations of Chinese cuisine (nevertheless closer to the traditional than American Chinese cuisine), Italian cuisine, and Japanese cuisine (sushi bars are a constant in a lot of cities and towns, and people from Rio de Janeiro are more used to temaki than people from São Paulo, home of more than 70% of the Japanese diaspora in the country).\nBrazil nut cake is a cake in Brazilian cuisine that is common and popular in the Amazon region of Brazil, Bolivia and Peru.\nBroa, cornbread with fennel.\nPirão, a porridge-like dish of manioc in fish stock.\nPão na chapa, a popular breakfast food.\n\n## Cheese\nSeveral types of cheese are produced exclusively in Brazil. The characteristics vary between the different states of the country, mainly depending on the climate, type of soil and cattle diet, which causes subtle changes in the quality of the milk. The dairy-producing state of Minas Gerais is known for most of these cheeses. Some of them are considered among the best cheeses in the world. Some of the country's most famous cheeses are:\n\nMinas, also known as \"white cheese\", is a light cow's milk cheese, packaged in water.\nCatupiry, a creamy, processed cheese invented in Minas Gerais that is primarily used as a topping or filling for pizzas. It is often sold in a distinctive round wooden box.\nRequeijão: a mildly salty, silky-textured, spreadable cheese often eaten on bread. There are several varieties: The \"Requeijão de Corte\" is the oldest variety, essentially artisanal, being solid; \"Requeijão Cremoso\" is currently the most widespread variety, being a pasty, white dairy product, made with skimmed milk and fresh cream. It is usually sold in glass or plastic cups and spread on bread for breakfast. \"Requeijão Culinário\" is a more consistent variety of creamy cottage cheese, designed to withstand high temperatures.\nCanastra\nCoalho, is a heat-resistant cheese, which means it can be cooked and grilled. It is usually eaten on beaches or at barbecues, roasted over a fire on skewers and eaten smoked over a fire.\n\n## Drinks\nCachaça is Brazil's native liquor, distilled from sugar cane and it is the main ingredient in the national drink, the Caipirinha. Other drinks include mate tea, chimarrão and tereré (both made up of yerba maté), coffee, fruit juice, beer (mainly Pilsen variety), rum, guaraná and batidas. Guaraná is a caffeinated soft drink made from guaraná seeds and batida is a type of fruit punch.\nOther drinks include:\n\nÁgua de Coco – coconut water.\nCaldo de cana – sugarcane juice.\nAluá – prepared with maize, rice and sugar. It has also been referred to as corn wine.\nBombeirinho – prepared with cachaça and gooseberry syrup, it is similar to a Kir Royal cocktail.\nCachaça – a distilled spirit made from sugarcane juice.

Brazilians inherited the taste and cultivation of sugar from the Portuguese who immigrated to Brazil. In the kitchens of the sugar farms, the wives of the farmers taught the subordinates how to properly mix the ingredients. This led to a growth in its commercialization in the Brazilian market, Portuguese recipes spread throughout the Brazilian colony and became part of the colonial food menu.\nThe Portuguese tradition of producing sweets with eggs and sugar joined the immense variety of Brazilian tropical fruits, which provided an immense menu of delicacies. Brazil has a variety of candies such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and Romeu e Julieta (cheese with a guava jam known as goiabada).\nPeanuts are used to make paçoca, rapadura and pé-de-moleque. Local common fruits like açaí, cupuaçu, mango, papaya, cocoa, cashew, guava, orange, passionfruit, pineapple, and hog plum are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream.\n\n### Typical cakes (bolos)\nPavê\nCuca, a board cake made with eggs, wheat flour, and butter and covered with sugar, very similar to Streuselkuchen, a traditional German cuisine cake. It is typical of the southern region of Brazil.\nNega maluca (chocolate cake with a chocolate cover and chocolate sprinkles)\nPão de mel (honey cake, somewhat resembling gingerbread, usually covered with melted chocolate)\nBolo de rolo (roll cake, a thin mass wrapped with melted guava)\nBolo de cenoura (carrot cake with chocolate cover made with butter and cocoa)\nBolo prestígio (cake covered with a version of brigadeiro, which replaces cocoa powder for grated coconut)\nBolo de fubá (corn flour cake)\nBolo de milho (Brazilian-style corn cake)\nBolo de maracujá (passion fruit cake)\nBolo de mandioca (cassava cake)\nBolo de queijo (literally \"cheese cake\")\nBolo de laranja (orange cake)\nBolo de banana (banana cake with cinnamon drizzle)\nBolo Souza Leão\nBolo Marta Rocha\nBolo de noiva\n\n### Other popular and traditional desserts\nBrigadeiro (a Brazilian chocolate candy, considered the most typical dessert in the country, a type of truffle made of condensed milk, butter and cocoa powder)\nPaçoca (similar to Spanish polvorones, but made with peanuts instead of almonds and without the addition of fats)\nQuindim (egg custard with coconut)\nCocada (coconut sweet)\nBeijinho (coconut \"truffles\" with clove)\nCajuzinho (peanut and cashew \"truffles\")\nPudim de leite (condensed milk-based crème caramel, of French origin)\nDoce de leite\nGoiabada\nOlho-de-sogra\nPé-de-moleque (made with peanuts and sugar caramel)\nSagu\nMousse de maracujá\nQueijadinha\nCreme de papaya\nMaria-mole\nPamonha (a traditional Brazilian food made from fresh corn and milk wrapped in corn husks and boiled).

It usually consists of a light meal, not uncommonly only a fruit or slice of bread paired with a cup of coffee. Traditional items include tropical fruits, typical cakes, crackers, bread, butter, cold cuts, cheese, requeijão, honey, jam, doce de leite, coffee (usually sweetened and with milk), juice, chocolate milk, or tea.\nElevenses or brunch, the lanche-da-manhã (literally, \"morning snack\"): usually had between 9 and 11 am, consists of similar items as people have for breakfast.\nMidday dinner or lunch, the almoço: this is usually the biggest meal and the most common times range from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Traditionally, people will go back to their houses to have lunch with their families, although nowadays that is not possible for most people, in which case it is common to have lunch in groups at restaurants or cafeterias. Rice is a staple of the Brazilian diet, albeit it is not uncommon to eat pasta instead. It is usually eaten together with beans and accompanied by salad, protein (most commonly red meat or chicken) and a side dish, such as polenta, potatoes, corn, etc.\nTea, the lanche-da-tarde or café-da-tarde (literally \"afternoon snack\" or \"afternoon coffee\"): it is a meal had between lunch and dinner, and basically everything people eat in the breakfast, they also eat in the afternoon snack. Nevertheless, fruits are less common.\nNight dinner or supper, the jantar: for most Brazilians, jantar is a light affair, while others dine at night. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pasta, hamburgers or hot-dogs, pizza or repeating lunchtime foods are the most common dishes.\nLate supper, the ceia: Brazilians eat soups, salads, pasta and what would be eaten at the elevenses if their jantar was a light one early at the evening and it is late at night or dawn. It is associated with Christmas and New Year's Eve.\n\n### Restaurant styles\nA simple and usually inexpensive option, which is also advisable for vegetarians, is comida a quilo or comida por quilo restaurants (literally \"food by kilo value\"), a buffet where food is paid for by weight. Another common style is the all-you-can-eat restaurant where customers pay a prix fixe. In both types (known collectively as \"self-services\"), customers usually assemble the dishes of their choice from a large buffet.\nRodízio is a common style of service, in which a prix fixe is paid, and servers circulate with food. This is common in churrascarias, pizzerias and sushi (Japanese cuisine) restaurants, resulting in an all-you-can-eat meat barbecue and pizzas of varied flavours, usually one slice being served at a time.\nThe regular restaurant where there is a specific price for each meal is called \"restaurante à la carte\".\n\n### Vegetarian\nAlthough many traditional dishes are prepared with meat or fish, it is not difficult to live on vegetarian food as well, at least in the mid-sized and larger cities of Brazil. There is a rich supply of all kinds of fruits and vegetables, and on city streets one can find cheese buns (pão de queijo); in some cities even the version made of soy.\nIn the 2000s, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília have gained several vegetarian and vegan restaurants. However outside big metropolises, vegetarianism is not very common in the country. Not every restaurant will provide vegetarian dishes and some seemingly vegetarian meals may turn out to include unwanted ingredients, for instance, using lard for cooking beans. Commonly \"meat\" is understood to mean \"red meat\", so some people might assume a vegetarian eats fish and chicken. Comida por quilo and all-you-can-eat restaurants prepare a wide range of fresh dishes. Diners can more easily find food in such restaurants that satisfy dietary restrictions.\n\n## See also\nCulinary art\nBrazilian tea culture\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Cuisine of Brazil at Wikimedia Commons",

Since then, well-known British chefs have wielded considerable influence on modern British and global cuisine, including Marco Pierre White, Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, Heston Blumenthal, Rick Stein, Nigella Lawson, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and Fanny Cradock.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Celtic origins and Roman conquest\nBritish cuisine has its roots in the cooking practices of the indigenous Celts. Celtic agriculture and animal breeding practices produced a wide variety of foodstuffs, such as grain, fruit, vegetables, and cattle. Archaeological evidence of cheese production can be seen as early as 3,800 BC, while bread from cereal grains was being produced as early as 3,700 BC. Ancient Celts fermented apples to produce cider, as recorded by Julius Caesar during his attempted invasions of Britain in 55-54 BC.\nStrabo records that Celtic Britons cultivated millet, herbs, and root vegetables, and practised apiculture to produce honey. Trade with Celtic Gauls in what is now modern-day France and the Low Countries, as well as with the Roman Republic following its conquest of Gaul, introduced grains such as wheat, oats, and rye. Barley was grown to produce porridge and malt for beer, while flax was grown for its oil. Broad beans, wild spinach, herbs, and primitive parsnips were the primary sources of vegetables and greens in Celtic Britain.\nAccording to Julius Caesar, Celtic Britons domesticated cattle, which were symbols of status and wealth, sheep and goats for their meat and milk; and, to a lesser extent, pigs for ham. Caesar notes that Celts also domesticated geese, chickens, and hares, but it is unclear whether they were kept for food or for religious rituals due to the association with Celtic deities. Trade with Romans also led to the import of wine.\nIn 43 AD, the Roman Empire invaded and began its conquest of Britain, eventually encompassing all of modern-day England, Wales, and parts of southern Scotland. The Roman conquest brought a culinary renaissance to the island, importing many foodstuffs which were hitherto unknown to Celtic Britons, including fruits such as figs, medlars, grapes, pears, cherries, plums, damsons, mulberries, dates, olives, vegetable marrows, and cucumbers; vegetables such as carrots, celery, asparagus, endives, turnips, cabbages, leeks, radishes, onions, shallots, and artichokes; nuts, seeds, and pulses such as sweet chestnuts, lentils, peas, pine nuts, almonds, walnuts, and sesame; and herbs and spices such as garlic, basil, parsley, borage, chervil, thyme, common sage, sweet marjoram, summer savory, black pepper, ginger, cinnamon, rosemary, mint, coriander, chives, dill, and fennel. Produced foods such as sausages were also imported, along with new animals, including rabbits, pheasants, peacocks, guinea fowl, and possibly fallow deer.\nRoman colonists were able to grow wine in vineyards as far north as Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire, and the longevity of Roman occupation is credited as creating the wine industry in Britain. The importance of seafood to the Roman diet led to its increasing popularity in Britain, particularly shellfish such as oysters. The quality of oysters from Colchester in particular became prized in Rome as a delicacy. After the end of Roman rule in Britain and the subsequent collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the use of  more exotic food items lessened. After the Roman period, British cuisine predominately consisted of vegetables, cereals, and meats such as mutton.\n\n### The Middle Ages\nShortly after the end of Roman rule in Britain, the Germanic Anglo-Saxons began conquering and colonising the island. The Anglo-Saxons introduced bacon to Britain during this period; rural families had their own recipes for curing and smoking bacon, while urban residents would purchase bacon from butchers who developed their own curing methods. Residents in London had access to a particularly diverse range of bacon products from across Britain. Anglo-Saxons helped to entrench stews, broths, and soups into British cuisine, along with an early form of the crumpet. Bread and butter became common fare, and the English in particular gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables. Ale was a popular drink of choice among the nobility and peasantry alike, and mead production increased around Christian monasteries. Danish and other Scandinavian invaders during the Viking Age introduced techniques for smoking and drying fish.\nAfter the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Normans reintroduced many spices and continental influences that had been lost after the departure of the Romans. Many of the modern English words for foodstuffs, such as beef, pork, mutton, gravy, jelly, mustard, onion, herb, and spice are derived from Old French words introduced by the Normans. Though eating habits and cooking methods remained largely unchanged, pig farming intensified under the Norman dynasty. The Crusades and trade with Arab Muslim empires introduced foods such as oranges and sugarcane to Britain.\nIt was during the late 14th century that the first cookery books began to emerge, notably the English book the Forme of Cury, containing recipes from the court of Richard II. The recipes it describes are diverse and sophisticated, with a wide variety of ingredients such as capon, pheasant, almonds, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, dates, pine nuts, saffron, mace, nutmeg and sugar. It also describes foods such as gingerbread, and sweet and sour sauces. Elaborate stews such as dillegrout became commonly served at the coronations of English monarchs. It was during the Middle Ages that many staples of British cuisine began to develop, such as the apple pie, an early cheesecake (called sambocade), custard, mince pies, pasties, and various forms of meat pies.\n\n### Tudor and Stuart era\nThe dawn of the Tudor dynasty following the Wars of the Roses coincided with the European discovery of the New World, the initiation of the Columbian exchange, and globalisation of trade, which opened up Britain to a range of new foodstuffs not seen since the Roman conquest. Foods from the New World included grains such as maize; fruits such as avocados, chili peppers chocolate, cranberries, guavas, papayas, pineapples, squashes, and tomatoes; vegetables such as potatoes, cassavas, and sweet potatoes; legumes such as peanuts and haricot beans, spices such as vanilla; and animals, most notably turkeys. The growth of the global spice trade, now dominated by rapidly expanding European empires, led to the re-proliferation of black pepper, nutmeg, cloves, mace, and cinnamon in British cookery.\nThe late 15th century saw the development of well-known alcoholic beverage Scotch whisky. It was during the early 16th century that cookery books printed using the printing press became more widely available, notably The Boke of Cokery printed at the turn of the century in 1500 by Richard Pynson, and The Good Huswifes Jewell towards the end of the century in 1585 by Thomas Dawson. Under the Tudor dynasty in England and Wales, and the Stuart dynasty in Scotland, British cuisine became more refined and grew more sophisticated. Recipes began to emphasise a balance of sweet and sour flavours, butter became a key ingredient in sauces, reflecting a trend seen in France that continued in subsequent centuries, and herbs such as thyme, used only sparingly in the medieval period, began to replace spices as flavourings.\nThroughout the Tudor period, fruits such as apples, gooseberries, grapes, oranges, and plums were commonly eaten. The main source of carbohydrates in British diets remained bread, and its composition reflected one's socio-economic class: the peasantry ate bread made from rye or coarse wheat, the emerging middle class of prosperous tenants ate a yeoman's bread made of wholemeal, while the most expensive bread was made of white wheat flour. Meat consumption grew rapidly throughout the 16th century as the price of meat fell, and poorer families who would have rarely enjoyed meat a century before now had wider access to it. Commoners living by rivers or along the coast ate seafood that was plentiful to the waters surrounding Britain, such as haddock, sole, cod, oysters, whitebait, and cockles, while the wealthier classes ate sturgeon, seals, crab, lobster, salmon, trout, and shrimp. Commoners ate whatever meat they could hunt, such as rabbit, blackbirds, chicken, ducks, and pigeons.\nThe nobility consumed fresh meat in such vast quantities that it constituted approximately 75% of their diet. For example, the quantities of meat procured for the court of Elizabeth I in just one year included 8,200 sheep, 2,330 deer, 1,870 pigs, 1,240 oxen, 760 calves, and 53 wild boar. Pies became an important staple as both food and for court theatrics; the nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\", with its lyrics \"Four and Twenty blackbirds / Baked in a pie. // When the pie is opened, the birds began to sing\", refers to the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving at a banquet. Nobles ate costlier or more unusual varieties of meat, such as swans, lamb and mutton, veal, beef, heron, pheasant, partridge, quail, peafowl, geese, boar, and venison. Royal banquets during the court of Henry VIII included unusual meats such as conger eel and porpoise.\nDesserts and sweet foods grew rapidly as European demand for sugar ballooned during the 16th century. Sweets in British cuisine at this time included pastry-based foods such as tarts, sweet flans, and custards. The 16th century saw the emergence of sweet foods such as the fruit fool, most commonly made with gooseberries, sugar, and clotted cream; syllabubs, a dessert made with milk or cream, sugar, and wine, and trifle, at the time a thick cream flavoured with sugar, ginger, and rosewater. Trifle has remained a staple of British cuisine and is a popular sweet dish today. Scones and shortbread developed in Scotland at this time; though shortbread had been known since the 12th century, it was refined into its modern form during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. As trade with Southeast Asia increased, widespread eating of rice became more common, though it was usually in the form of a dessert, giving rise to rice pudding in Britain.\nDuring the Stuart dynasty into the 17th century, trade with Africa, India, and China increased, largely through private interests, namely the East India Company. Fruits such as bananas became more commonplace, however it was the introduction of tea that would have a much more profound effect on British culinary habits. Tea remained quite expensive until the 18th century, and it was only consumed by wealthier middle class individuals and those in the nobility before that time. Coffee, a drink derived from the beans of a plant native to Yemen, was introduced to Europe through Italy, and became highly successful in the mid-to-late 17th century. Coffee houses sprang up across Britain; one, Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still open today as the oldest continually-serving coffee house in Europe. Owing to the growing appreciation of sweet foods in Britain, the sponge cake, which would later become a defining food of the Victorian era and afternoon tea, had its start in the early 17th century, which mixed flour, sugar, and eggs, seasoned with anise and coriander seeds. The alcoholic beverage rum, produced from molasses throughout the Caribbean and North America, came to be associated with the British Royal Navy at this time, when they captured the valuable sugar-producing island of Jamaica in 1655.\n\n### Georgian era\nIn 1707, the kingdoms of England (which included Wales) and Scotland united to form a new country, the Kingdom of Great Britain. For the vast majority of the 18th century, the new British nation was ruled by the House of Hanover under the Georgian dynasty. During this time, the British deepened their influence in India, displacing the Dutch and French as the preeminent European power in southeast Asia. Increasing British domination of global trade, cheapening of ingredients hitherto affordable only to wealthier individuals, and a burgeoning middle class led to many innovations in British cuisine, influenced by foods the British encountered in India.  \nElizabeth Raffald brought out a cookbook, The Experienced English Housekeeper, that includes an early recipe for macaroni cheese.    It also contained the first recipe for a Bride cake.  It demonstrated the appreciation of potted meats and preserves in the Georgian era.\nThe 18th century saw a revolution in English cookery books, notably The Compleat Housewife in 1727 by Eliza Smith and The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy twenty years later by writer Hannah Glasse, which became a best seller for a century. Glasse's book not only heavily influenced British cuisine, but also early American cuisine, with copies owned by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington. The book contains the earliest written recipe for what looks like fried chicken as well as the first known recipe in English for curry, which called for chicken to be fried in butter, ground turmeric, ginger, and pepper, then stewed with cream and lemon juice added before serving, resembling the modern dish butter chicken. Dishes that would become staples of British cuisine well into the 21st century were first mentioned in Glasse's book, such as Yorkshire pudding, burgers (called \"Hamburgh sausage\"), the addition of jelly into trifle, and piccalilli.\nPies and other hearty snack-type foods continued to develop in variety and popularity, favoured by hunters as an easy, portable lunch. Glasse describes a \"Cheshire pork pie\", a pie filled with layers of pork loin and apples, sweetened with sugar and filled with white wine. The sandwich, now a global staple with countless varieties though originally referring to roast beef between two slices of toasted bread, and named for John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, gained widespread popularity in the 18th century. Montagu reputedly ordered the food during late-night sessions in gambling houses, as it could be eaten without the need for cutlery, allowing him to continue his gambling uninterrupted. With the Industrial Revolution rapidly developing during the 18th century in Britain and the growth of a new, industrial urban-based working class, the demand for fast, portable, and inexpensive meals grew considerably, leading to the ubiquitous adoption of the sandwich. Similar foods previously reserved for the upper class also started gaining popularity with the working class in other parts of the country, such as the Cornish pasty, favoured by miners in Cornish tin mines, working to fuel Britain's growing industry. Tavern-style foods which became culinary classics developed during this time, notably Welsh rarebit, consisting of toasted bread topped with a sauce made of cheese, ale, and mustard.\nRoast beef became an entrenched staple of British culinary identity in the 18th century, so much so that a French nickname for the British (more specifically the English) is \"les Rosbifs\" (the roast beefs). It was during the late 18th century that roast beef gained its association with the Sunday roast dinner, a cornerstone of British cuisine. Families would place a cut of meat into the oven with root vegetables such as potatoes, turnips, and parsnips before attending the Sunday church service. Upon their return, the meal would be cooked, and the juices from the roast was then used to make a gravy to pour on top of the dinner. Though roast beef is most strongly associated with the traditional Sunday roast dinner, other meats are more commonly used today, such as chicken, lamb, pork, and sometimes duck, goose, gammon, turkey, or other game birds. With the Industrial Revolution increasingly mechanising food production and advancing food science, the world's first commercial bacon processing plant was opened in Wiltshire by John Harris in the 1770s. Today, Wiltshire cured bacon is prized in Britain for its quality. Amateur plant breeder Thomas Edward Knight of Downton, near Salisbury, England, developed the world's first sweet-tasting pea.\nPoorer households attempting to extend the longevity of their meat stores made them into savoury batter puddings, giving rise to the classic dish Toad in the hole. Originally the dish used beef and pigeon, however it is most commonly associated today with sausages, served with vegetables and onion gravy. Scouse, essentially a beef and root vegetable stew, developed along similar lines of thrift. The name, derived from lobscouse, is the origin of the term \"Scouser\", a nickname for people from Liverpool, due to the association of the dish with that city, particularly sailors. Sailors engaged in trade in Asia returned with knowledge of savoury sauces used as condiments. Eliza Smith subsequently published the first recipe for ketchup, a mushroom variety which used anchovies and horseradish. British ketchup consequently used mushrooms rather than tomatoes as the primary ingredient, and was prepared extensively by British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies. Chutney, a type of preserved relish developed in India, gained huge popularity in Britain, particularly with the working class who desired ever more exotic flavours in their diet.\nThe British penchant for sweet foods continued throughout the Georgian era. The staple of bread and butter pudding, a baked custard-based dish made with bread, butter, currants, cream, eggs, and nutmeg, was first described in 1728 by Eliza Smith. Adapting earlier recipes of Portuguese quince paste, the Scots invented the modern form of marmalade; an easily spreadable fruit preserve made from bitter orange. Eccles cakes, a small flaky pastry filled with currants, emerged in the late 18th century, which still retains some popularity today particularly in Manchester and Lancashire. Suet pudding, a boiled, steamed, or baked pudding of wheat flour, suet, dried fruits, and spices developed during this time, and become popular fare.\nThe British conquest of India led to the acquisition of the large Indian tea industry, resulting in tea becoming cheaper to import than coffee. The ease of tea production compared to coffee led to tea becoming a British staple, spreading through all classes, becoming a prominent feature of modern British culture and identity. Gin, an alcoholic beverage introduced into Britain in the latter half of the 17th century, exploded in popularity throughout the first half of the 18th century, and became extremely popular with the lower classes. Its popularity and heavy consumption was such that the British Parliament passed five major Acts to control the consumption of the drink.\n\n### Victorian era\nVictoria ascended the throne in 1837 and ruled until 1901. The longevity of her reign helped entrench many culinary traditions and trends. For example, she developed a love of Indian chutneys and curry, and ordered curry twice a week on average. The trend became popular among the aristocracy and, in turn, spread throughout society.\nEmerging social changes also influenced the growth and development of British cuisine. Writers such as American-born Elizabeth Robins Pennell helped to re-cast cooking not as a duty, but as a valuable creative pursuit by framing cooking as a \"high art practised by geniuses\", encouraging upper and middle class Victorian women to express their own culinary creativity for the first time. This tied into the growth of the middle class in Victorian Britain as wealth poured in from all over the Empire, and industrialisation spread into food production which cheapened ingredients, allowing more people to purchase goods previously reserved only for the very wealthy. Middle-class women, in lieu of being able to afford servants and private cooks, began to make more elaborate dishes to impress guests at dinner parties.\nBritain's rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in the 19th century impacted people of all socio-economic classes. Wealthy aristocrats began to have their evening meal later in the day, but still took lunch at midday. Consequently, shortly after Victoria's ascension to the throne, one of her ladies-in-waiting, Anna Maria Russell, began to ask for tea, bread, and cake to be delivered to her room. The habit soon spread among the aristocracy, birthing a new tradition of afternoon tea. Industrialisation helped reduce costs of ingredients thanks to mass-production, and pared-down versions of lavish meals characteristic of the upper class began to reach the middle and working class, such as the cooked full breakfast, usually composed of fried sausage or bacon, cooked eggs, assorted sides and toast, which grew in popularity during the Victorian era.\nThroughout the 19th century, Iberian Jewish immigrants in London introduced their method of coating fish in flour, and later a mix of flour and water, before frying in oil. Fish, which was plentiful, affordable, and widely eaten on Fridays, led to the opening of the first fish and chip shop by Eastern European Jewish immigrant Joseph Malin. Combining fried fish with chips, often served with mushy peas and tartare sauce as fish and chips, proved to be an incredibly popular and affordable takeaway food among the working class. The popularity of the dish has led to it being termed one of Britain's national dishes.\nThe British staple of stewed meats further developed into more distinct dishes in the Victorian era. Lancashire hotpot, a dish served in the north-west of England around Liverpool and Manchester, consisting of a mutton or lamb stew topped with sliced potatoes and baked in a heavy pot, developed as a distinct regional dish. Like the Sunday roast, Lancashire hotpot could be left to cook slowly while the family worked, making it a popular choice for the growing working class. While a slowly steamed suet pudding of stewed beef had been common in British cuisine since the 18th century, it was not until the mid-19th century that cooks began to add kidneys, forming the steak and kidney pudding. Initially more of a regional dish, its ease of preparation and popularity led to it becoming recognised as a traditional British dish.\nThe continuing need for inexpensive and portable foods for the predominately industrial and urban working class, which had boosted the popularity of foods such as the Cornish pasty and the sandwich, led to the popularising of the sausage roll, consisting of seasoned sausage meat wrapped in puff pastry and baked golden-brown. While meats wrapped in dough were known in Ancient Greece and Rome, it was not until the 19th century that the sausage roll became widely available. Sausage rolls remain an indelible aspect of British culture and a widely popular snack food; the British bakery chain Greggs sells approximately 140 million of them every year.\n\nIt was during this time that mass-produced condiments became available thanks to industrialised food production. Worcestershire sauce, a fermented sauce made primarily of anchovies, vinegar, tamarind, and spices which had its roots in Ancient Roman garum and mushroom ketchup, was developed by chemists John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins in the early 19th century. Today, Lea & Perrins remains the world's largest brand of Worcestershire sauce. In the early 19th century, Royal chefs produced brown sauce, typically made of tomatoes and molasses. A.1. Sauce was first developed in Royal kitchens, however it fell out of favour in the British domestic market, though it has enjoyed enduring popularity in American cuisine as a steak sauce. HP Sauce, named after the Houses of Parliament, made from tomatoes, molasses, vinegar, and spices was introduced in the late 19th century and became so popular it is now regarded as an iconic sauce of British cuisine.\nThe British love of sweet foods spurred increasing innovation in the field of desserts. The world's first documented recipe for the ice cream cone was published by English writer Agnes Marshall, consisting of baked almonds. Marshall is consequently considered the inventor of the ice cream cone. Battenberg cake, made by baking yellow and pink almond sponge cakes before being cut and arranged into a chequered pattern, held together by jam and covered with marzipan, originated in the late 19th century, purportedly named for the marriage of Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria's granddaughter, to Prince Louis of Battenberg in 1884. The first printed recipe for Eton mess was published in 1893, a traditional dessert consisting of a mixture of strawberries, sweet meringue, and whipped cream. Madeira wine, popular in England in the mid-19th century, directly influenced the development of Madeira cake, a light sponge or butter cake traditionally flavoured with lemon, as an accompaniment to eat with the wine. Jam roly-poly, a simple dessert made of flat-rolled suet pudding spread with jam and rolled-up, similar to a Swiss roll, then steamed or baked and served with custard first emerged in the early 19th century. Its affordability, ease of production, and popularity led to it becoming a modern British classic.\nThroughout the mid 19th century, innovations in food preservation and production allowed the mass-production of chocolate as a food, as opposed to primarily a drink. British Quakers, who were opposed to alcohol as a cause of moral sin, began to champion chocolate as an ethical alternative. Quakers came to establish three household chocolate brands which became worldwide names: Fry's, Rowntree's, and notably, Cadbury's, the latter of which would become the world's second-largest confectionary brand.\nAs gin regained popularity fears of a return to the Gin Craze led to the Beerhouse Act, which aimed to promote beer as a safer alternative and encourage the creation of controlled venues for workers in rapidly expanding industrial centres. The Act spurred a proliferation of public houses and increased beer consumption. As the 19th century progressed, many establishments underwent lavish refurbishment to compete with gin palaces, and to distinguish themselves from one another, further solidifying alcohol consumption as an integral part of British culture.\n\n### 20th century\nThe haute cuisine of the late Victorian era and early 20th century was heavily influenced by French cuisine, with groundbreaking chefs such as Escoffier recruited by the Savoy Hotel in London. However, British cuisine for much of the 20th century was severely impacted by the effects of rationing during the First and Second World Wars. The latter half of the First World War saw voluntary rationing, which limited the average citizen to a daily 1,680 calorie-ration of butter or margarine, sugar, tea, jam, bacon, and other meat. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, bread was not rationed. During the war, average energy intake decreased by only 3%, but protein intake by 6%. Rationing after the First World War was not lifted in full until 1921, over three years after the war's end.\nRationing during the Second World War was much more significant, widespread, and tightly controlled by the state. Rationing continued for nearly a full decade after the war, and restrictions were made stricter in 1947 than during the war itself. As a result, many children of the Silent and Boomer generations were raised without access to many previously common ingredients. For example, in 1942, many young children when questioned about bananas did not believe they were a real fruit. Bread was not rationed until after the war ended, but was replaced by a \"national loaf\" of wholemeal which was found to be mushy and grey. Fish was not rationed, but hundreds of fishing trawlers were requisitioned for military use by the Royal Navy and fish supplies dropped by nearly a third of pre-war levels, resulting in increased prices at fishmongers. Owing to its popularity and morale-boosting comfort food qualities, fish and chips was one of the few dishes not subject to rationing. Though not rationed, most alcoholic drinks except beer were scarce, and there was a ban on importing sugar for brewing. Many pubs in 1945 ran out of pint glasses, as glass itself was in short supply and many patrons wishing to celebrate the end of the war at their local would recall a lengthy wait to be served; owing to wait on patrons finishing drinks so as their glass could be washed and reused.\nRestaurants were initially exempt from rationing, but this policy was subsequently reversed after public outrage that \"luxury\" foods were being enjoyed by wealthier classes while the rest of the population were subject to tightly controlled rationing. The Government subsequently introduced new restrictions on restaurants; capping prices, limiting the serving time of meals, and limiting the ingredients that could be used. A standard weekly ration by the war's end consisted of 4oz (113g) of bacon,1 shilling 2d of Meat,  8oz of sugar, 2oz of loose tea, 2oz of cheese, 2lb of marmalade (or 1lb of either preserves or sugar), 2oz of butter, 4oz of margarine, and 2oz of lard. Additionally, 12oz of sweets were allowed on a monthly basis.\nThere was an allowance for vegetarians, who, in exchange for surrendering their meat coupons, could receive double rations of cheese instead.\nAfter the war ended, rationing was kept in place, partially to help feed people in European areas whose economies had been virtually destroyed by the fighting, but also because resources were unavailable to expand food production and imports. Frequent strikes, critically by dock workers, only exacerbated the dire situation. The most common form of rationing fraud, was people using ration books of those who had died as a means to acquire extra food. In the years following the war, the bacon ration was cut by a quarter, and poor harvests resulted in the introduction of potato rationing, Due to the austerity measures that were kept in place or expanded (with the exception of the new National Health Service) by the postwar Labour government, the Conservatives rallied support from disgruntled housewives that led them to victory at the 1951 general election. The Conservative government formally abolished rationing entirely in 1954, although the effects of rationing severely impacted the food production industry for decades to come. For example, cheese production virtually ground to a halt, and some varieties of British cheese came close to disappearing altogether; with the cheese industry not fully recovering until the 1990s.\nWartime rationing and subsequent food scarcity at a time when British culinary traditions were strong, likely contributed to a sharp decline of the international reputation of British cuisine. The Good Food Guide in the 1960s described the food of the previous decade as \"intolerable\" due to food shortages of even simple ingredients such as butter, cream, and meat.\nRationing helped to spur innovation in recipes as food shortages compelled creativity. The natural sweetness of carrots, a vegetable whose consumption was promoted by the Government, were favoured as an alternative to sugar. Carrot cake, though it had its origins in a 16th-century recipe, exploded in popularity across Britain. Crumble, a sweet dish of baked fruit filling topped with a streusel grew in popularity during and after the war, due to the topping being easier and less expensive to produce compared to pastry. The Ploughman's lunch, initially a simple rustic meal of bread, cheese, beer, and pickled onions emerged in the 1950s, though it didn't achieve widespread popularity until the 1970s where it was favoured due to its simplicity, ease of preparation, and high profit margin due to it not containing meat; though modern variations of the meal include pork pies. The Bakewell tart, a variant of the Bakewell pudding, made of a shortcrust pastry shell beneath layers of jam, frangipane, and topped with flaked almonds developed in the 20th century. The sticky toffee pudding, now a widely-popular dessert of a muffin-like sponge cake covered in a toffee sauce made from cream and dark sugars, served with custard or vanilla ice cream, developed in the north-west of England, where it is seem as a regional culinary symbol.\n\n### 21st century\nBritish cuisine has continued to evolve throughout the 21st century. Some of Britain's more classic dishes have fallen out of favour with the modern British public. A 2021 survey by Mortar Research found more than 28% of Britons had never eaten toad in the hole, and many traditional dishes and ingredients were believed to be imaginary by the following margins: 20% for toad in the hole, 18% for spotted dick, 13% for Eton mess, 11% for bangers and mash and Scotch eggs, and 10% for black pudding. However, other classic foods remained popular, with 90% having eaten a Cornish pasty at some point in their lives. Snack foods such as sausage rolls also remain popular, with the bakery chain Greggs selling 140 million per year.\nEating habits and recipes have been affected by rising vegetarianism and veganism; a 2021 YouGov survey found 8% of Britons were now eating a plant-based diet, and more than a third said they were interested in becoming vegan. In 2023, government reports found that meat and fish consumption were at their lowest levels since record-keeping began in 1974.\nDebora Robertson, writing in The Daily Telegraph, argues that all aspects of British cuisine has undergone a culinary revolution, shedding the spectres of wartime rationing and post-war food scarcity, and its standards now rivals that of France. This has been reflected in the number of Michelin starred restaurants in Britain: the 2024 Michelin Guide awarded 9 restaurants in Britain with the coveted three stars, with six of them in London alone, more than any other city in the world except for Paris and Tokyo. In 2010, The Waterside Inn in Bray became the first restaurant outside of France to retain three Michelin stars for a quarter of a century. The Fat Duck, a three-Michelin-star restaurant, also in Bray, was named the world's best restaurant in 2005. As of the 2024 guide, there are 185 restaurants in Britain with at least one Michelin star; 165 in England, 11 in Scotland, 6 in Wales, and 3 in Northern Ireland, only 75 fewer than the entirety of the United States.\nThe late 1990s and particularly the early 21st century saw a major shift in British pubs. While many pubs had a long tradition of serving food, owing to their historic heritage as traveller's inns, most pubs were solely drinking establishments and little emphasis was placed on food, other than simple meals such as sandwiches, and bar snacks, usually pork scratchings, pickled eggs, crisps, and peanuts. These foods with their strong emphasis on salt, which dries out the mouth, were specifically intended to increase beer sales. By the turn of the century with the widespread introduction of microwave ovens and frozen food, the quality of food pubs served declined but variety increased, with most pubs serving steak and ale pie, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, ploughman's lunch, chicken tikka masala, and pasties, as well as foods typically indicative of other cultures, such as burgers, chicken wings, lasagne and chilli con carne.\nIn 1991 the term gastropub, a portmanteau of \"gastronomy\" and \"pub\", was coined when David Eyre and Mike Belben took over The Eagle pub in London. Gastropubs are defined as pubs that serve high-quality food comparable with a restaurant, with a near equal emphasis on eating and drinking. Gastropubs caused a significant shift in British dining and pub culture, with the term being added to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2012, and the gastropub concept being exported overseas where it found significant popularity in the United States and Canada. The renewed emphasis on food quality in gastropubs has led many to be awarded Michelin stars: the gastropub The Hand & Flowers in Marlow became the first pub to ever be awarded two Michelin stars.\nThe popularity and growth of gastropubs has been such that, in 2011, The Good Food Guide suggested that there was no longer any need to distinguish traditional pubs from gastropubs in any meaningful way, and the term had become irrelevant. Gastropubs have attracted criticism, however, from those arguing that they have gentrified traditional pubs, causing them to lose their quaint character.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing movement to revive traditional British bread-making. Chef Michel Roux Jr highlighted the decline of artisanal baking in Britain, and the need to return to traditional methods. Roux has emphasised the importance of making bread with simple, natural ingredients and the benefits of supporting local, independent bakeries. He hopes that public awareness and consumer choices will help preserve this aspect of Britain's culinary heritage.\n\n## Popular dishes\nAccording to a 2025 survey by YouGov, the most popular British food is roast chicken, closely followed by chips and English breakfast.\nCurries are a large part of British cuisine, with cooks in the United Kingdom creating curries distinct to the country. Chicken tikka masala, which comprises 15 per cent of orders in British Indian restaurants, was called \"a true British national dish\" by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in 2001. Generally, British curries are thicker and sweeter than their Indian counterparts. Curry sauces in Britain are interchangeable between meats, while in India different meats have non-interchangeable sauces. A key ingredient to a British curry is curry powder, a \"British concoction\" of spices.\n\n## National cuisines\n\n\n### English\nEnglish cuisine has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from North America, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration. Some traditional meals, such as sausages, bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, broths and freshwater and saltwater fish have ancient origins. The 14th-century English cookery book, the Forme of Cury, contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II.\n\n### Northern Irish\nNorthern Ireland's culinary heritage has its roots in the staple diet of generations of farming families—bread and potatoes.  Historically, limited availability of ingredients and low levels of immigration resulted in restricted variety and relative isolation from wider international culinary influences. The 21st century has seen significant changes in local cuisine, characterised by an increase in the variety, quantity and quality of gastropubs and restaurants. There are currently three Michelin-starred restaurants in Northern Ireland, all of which specialise in traditional dishes made using local ingredients.\n\n### Scottish\nScottish cuisine has closer links to Scandinavia and France than English cuisine has. Traditional Scottish dishes include bannocks, brose, cullen skink, Dundee cake, haggis, marmalade, porridge, and Scotch broth. The cuisines of the northern islands of Orkney and Shetland are distinctively different from that of mainland Scotland. The nation is known for its whiskies.\n\n### Welsh\nWelsh cuisine in the Middle Ages was limited in range; Gerald of Wales, chaplain to Henry II, wrote after an 1188 tour that \"The whole population lives almost entirely on oats and the produce of their herds, milk, cheese and butter. You must not expect a variety of dishes from a Welsh kitchen, and there are no highly-seasoned titbits to whet your appetite.\"\nIn modern times, the cuisine includes recipes for Welsh lamb, and dishes such as cawl, Welsh rarebit, laverbread, Welsh cakes, bara brith and Glamorgan sausage.\n\n## See also\nAgriculture in the United Kingdom#History\nChannel Islands cuisine\nCuisine of the Thirteen Colonies\nCulture of the United Kingdom\nList of British breads\nList of British desserts\nList of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status\nList of English dishes\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nBlue, Anthony Dias (2004).

Alcohol is banned in Brunei. In rural areas, game animals such as wild birds, sambar deer, and barking deer are hunted.\n\n## Foods and dishes\nDishes from Brunei are often spicy and are commonly eaten with either rice or noodles. Nasi katok, beef rendang, nasi lemak, and pajeri nanas are popular foods in Brunei. Among the few dishes peculiar to Brunei is ambuyat, a sticky ball of flavourless sago starch, which is wrapped around a bamboo fork and dipped into a spicy and sour gravy. Nasi katok, which literally means 'knock rice', consists of plain rice, fried chicken and sambal, a spicy relish made from ground chili peppers and a variety of secondary ingredients, including shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, lime juice, vinegar, and anchovies. Traditionally, nasi katok is served and wrapped in brown paper.\n\n## Beverages\nCommon drinks include coconut milk, fruit juice, tea, milk tea and coffee.\n\n## References\n\nBrunei 2009.

Bun kababs are usually eaten as a main course or snack.\n\n## History\nThe origins of the bun kabab trace back to Karachi during the 1950s, however its exact inception is debated. Some claim that Haji Abdul Razzak introduced the sandwich as a quick meal for workers in 1953. Another claim is that the bun kebab evolved from the vada pav, a fast food style sandwich native to the Indian city of Mumbai. A third view is that it was first found outside the Khayam Cinema as a food made primarily for moviegoers.\nAfter the initial emergence of the bun kabab, new patty variations rose to popularity, including dal patties and shami kebab.\n\n## Ingredients\nA bun kabab consists of a shallow-fried spicy patty called shami kebab, onions, and chutney and/or raita in a grilled bun. The chutney is made up from tamarind (imli), salt, cumin powder, and whole red chillies.\nBun kabab patties are typically composed of ground beef or mutton, ground lentils, powdered cumin seeds, and an egg batter. Although they can be vegetarian. The patties are fried in ghee or oil. A bun kabab can also be served with a fried egg or omelette and topped with tomatoes, cucumbers, or onions.\n\n## Variations\nThe patty, shami kabab, can be made of chicken, beef, mutton, potato (aloo wala), egg (anday wala), or lentil (daal). The beef and egg recipe is the most popular, especially among street vendors.\n\n## See also\n\nIndian cuisine\nAwadhi cuisine\nHyderabadi cuisine\nPakistani cuisine\nFast food\nKebab\nList of sandwiches\nList of buns\nVada pav\n\n\n== References ==",

By 3000 BCE, irrigated rice cultivation flourished in the region, paralleled by the domestication of cattle and pigs by inhabitants.\nIn addition to rice, tea originated in the borderlands separating Myanmar from China, precipitating a longstanding tradition of tea consumption and the development of pickled tea known as laphet, which continues to play a pivotal role in Burmese ritual culture. This longstanding history is reflected in the Burmese language, which is among the few world languages whose word for \"tea\" is not etymologically traced back to the Chinese word for \"tea\" (see etymology of tea).\nAgrarian settlements were settled by ancestors of Myanmar's modern-day ethnolinguistic groups. From these settlements emerged a succession of Burmese, Mon, Shan, Rakhine-speaking kingdoms and tributary states that now make up contemporary Myanmar. Paddy rice cultivation remains synonymous with the predominantly Buddhist Bamar, Mon, Shan, and Rakhine peoples who inhabit the country's fertile lowlands and plateaus.\nBurmese cuisine has been significantly enriched by contact and trade with neighboring kingdoms and countries well into modern times. The Columbian exchange in the 15th and 16th centuries introduced key ingredients into the Burmese culinary repertoire, including tomatoes, chili peppers, peanuts, and potatoes. A series of Burmese–Siamese wars between the 16th to 19th centuries resulted in the emergence of Thai-inspired delicacies, including khanon dok, shwe yin aye, mont let hsaung, and Yodaya mont di.\n\nWhile record-keeping of pre-colonial culinary traditions is scant, food was and remains deeply intertwined with religious life, especially among Buddhist communities, exemplified in the giving of food alms (dāna), and communal feasts called satuditha and ahlu pwe (အလှူပွဲ). One of the few remaining pre-colonial cookbooks is the Sadawhset Kyan (စားတော်ဆက်ကျမ်း, lit. 'Treatise on Royal Foods'), written on a palm leaf manuscript in 1866 during the Konbaung dynasty. By the Konbaung dynasty (16th to 19th centuries), elaborate preparations of food played a central role in key court ceremonies (e.g., naming ceremonies, wedding ceremonies, etc.), including as ritual offerings to Hindu and indigenous deities, and as celebratory meals for attendees. By the Konbaung period, 126 distinct varieties of rice were cultivated in the country.\nBritish rule in Burma between the 19th and 20th centuries led to the establishment of Burmese Indian and Sino-Burmese communities that introduced novel cooking techniques, ingredients, food vocabulary, and fusion dishes that are now considered integral parts of Burmese cuisine. These range from Indian breads such as naan and paratha to Chinese stir frying techniques and ingredients like tofu and soy sauce.\n\n## Etiquette and customs\n\n\n### Dining\nTraditionally, the Burmese eat meals from plates on a low table or daunglan, while sitting on a bamboo mat. Dishes are simultaneously served and shared. A traditional meal includes steamed white rice as the main dish accompanied by Burmese curries, a light soup or consommé, and other side dishes, including fried vegetables, Burmese fritters, and ngapi yay gyo (ငါးပိရည်ကျို), a plate of fresh and blanched vegetables served with pickled fish dip. The meal is then finished with a piece of palm sugar or laphet (fermented tea leaves).\nOut of respect, the eldest diners are always served first before the rest join in; even when the elders are absent, the first morsel of rice from the pot is scooped and put aside as an act of respect to one's parents, a custom known as u cha (ဦးချ, lit. 'first serve').\nThe Burmese traditionally eat with their right hand, forming the rice into a small ball with only the fingertips and mixing this with various morsels before popping it into their mouths. Chopsticks and Chinese-style spoons are used for noodle dishes, although noodle salads are more likely to be eaten with just a spoon. Western-style utensils, especially forks and knives, have gained currency in recent years.\nIn traditional Burmese eateries, green tea and numerous side dishes are served complimentary alongside the main dishes and rice.\n\n### Religious practices\nThe country's diverse religious makeup influences its cuisine, as Buddhists and Hindus traditionally avoid beef and Muslims pork. Beef is considered taboo by devout Buddhists and farmers because the cow is highly regarded as a beast of burden. Vegetarianism is commonly practiced by Buddhists during the three-month Vassa (ဝါတွင်း) between July and October, as well as during Uposatha days, reflected in the Burmese word for \"vegetarian,\" thet that lut (သက်သတ်လွတ်, lit. 'free of killing'). During this time, devout Buddhists observe eight or more precepts, including fasting rules that restrict food intake to two daily meals (i.e., breakfast and lunch) taken before noon.\n\n### Beef taboo\nThe beef taboo is fairly widespread in Myanmar, particularly in the Buddhist community. In Myanmar, beef is typically obtained from cattle that are slaughtered at the end of their working lives (16 years of age) or from sick animals. Cattle is rarely raised for meat; 58% of cattle in the country is used for draught animal power. Few people eat beef, and there is a general dislike of beef (especially among the Bamar and Burmese Chinese), although it is more commonly eaten in regional cuisines, particularly those of ethnic minorities like the Kachin. Buddhists, when giving up meat during the Buddhist (Vassa) or Uposatha days, will forego beef first. Butchers tend to be Muslim because of the Buddhist doctrine of ahimsa (no harm).\nDuring the country's last dynasty, the Konbaung dynasty, habitual consumption of beef was punishable by public flogging. In 1885, Ledi Sayadaw, a prominent Buddhist monk wrote the Nwa-myitta-sa (နွားမေတ္တာစာ), a poetic prose letter which argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, because Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle, and that the practice was ecologically unsound. He subsequently led successful beef boycotts during the colonial era, and influenced a generation of Burmese nationalists in adopting this stance.\nOn 29 August 1961, the Burmese Parliament passed the State Religion Promotion Act of 1961, which explicitly banned the slaughtering of cattle nationwide (beef became known as todo tha (တိုးတိုးသား); lit. 'hush hush meat'). Religious groups, such as Muslims, were required to apply for exemption licences to slaughter cattle on religious holidays. This ban was repealed a year later, after Ne Win led a coup d'état and declared martial law in the country.\n\n### Food theories\nIn traditional Burmese medicine, foods are divided into two classes: heating (အပူစာ, apu za) or cooling (အအေးစာ, a-aye za), based on their effects on one's body system, similar to the Chinese classification of food. Examples of heating foods include chicken, bitter melon, durian, mango, chocolate, and ice cream. Examples of cooling foods include pork, eggplant, dairy products, cucumbers, and radish.\nThe Burmese also hold several taboos and superstitions regarding consumption during various occasions in one's life, especially pregnancy. For instance, pregnant women are not supposed to eat chili, due to the belief that it causes children to have sparse scalp hairs.\n\n## Cooking techniques\nBurmese dishes are not cooked with precise recipes. The use and portion of ingredients used may vary, but the precision of timing is of utmost importance. Burmese dishes may be stewed, boiled, fried, roasted, steamed, baked or grilled, or any combination of the said techniques. Burmese curries use only a handful of spices (in comparison to Indian ones) and use more fresh garlic and ginger.\n\n## Regional cuisines\nBroadly speaking, Burmese cuisine is divided between the culinary traditions of Upper Myanmar, which is inland and landlocked; and Lower Myanmar, which is surrounded by numerous rivers, river deltas, and the Andaman Sea. Variations between regional cuisines are largely driven by the availability of fresh ingredients. Myanmar's long coastline has provided an abundant source of fresh seafood, which is particularly associated with Rakhine cuisine. Southern Myanmar, particularly the area around Mawlamyaing, is known for its cuisine, as the Burmese proverb goes: \"Mandalay for eloquence, Yangon for boasting, Mawlamyaing for food.\"\nCuisine in Lower Myanmar, including Yangon and Mawlamyaing, makes extensive use of fish and seafood-based products like fish sauce and ngapi (fermented seafood). The cuisine in Upper Myanmar, including the Bamar heartland (Mandalay, Magway, and Sagaing Regions), Shan State, and Kachin States, tends to use more meat, poultry, pulses and beans. The level of spices and use of fresh herbs varies depending on the region; Kachin and Shan curries will often use more fresh herbs.\nFusion Chettiar (ချစ်တီးကုလား) cuisine, originating from Southern Indian cuisine, is also popular in cities.\n\n## Dishes and ingredients\nBurmese cuisine incorporates numerous local ingredients that are less frequently used in other Southeast Asian cuisines, among them sour roselle leaves, astringent pennywort leaves, goat, mutton, and dried beans and lentils.\nBecause a standardised system of romanisation for spoken Burmese does not exist, pronunciations of the following dishes in modern standard Burmese approximated using IPA are provided (see IPA/Burmese for details).\n\n### Preserved foods\nMyanmar is one of very few countries where tea is not only drunk but eaten as lahpet, pickled tea served with various accompaniments. The practice of eating tea dates in modern-day Myanmar back to prehistoric antiquity, reflecting the legacy of indigenous tribes who pickled and fermented tea leaves inside bamboo tubes, bamboo baskets, plantain leaves and pots. Tea leaves are traditionally cultivated by the Palaung people. Pickled tea leaves continue to play an important role in Burmese culture today.\nNgapi (ငါးပိ), a fermented paste made from salted fish or shrimp, is considered the cornerstone of any Burmese traditional meal. It is used to season many soups, salads, curries and dishes, and condiments, imparting a rich umami flavor. The ngapi of Rakhine State contains no or little salt, and uses marine fish. Meanwhile, ngapi made with freshwater fish is common in Ayeyarwady and Tanintharyi regions. Ngapi yay (ငါးပိရည်) is an essential part of Karen and Bamar cuisine, in which a sauce dip of ngapi cooked in various vegetables and spices is served with blanched and fresh vegetables, similar to Thai nam phrik, Indonesian lalab, and Malay ulam. Pickled fish, called ngachin, is also used in Burmese cooking.\nShan cuisine traditionally uses fermented beans called pè ngapi (ပဲငါးပိ; lit. 'bean ngapi'), in lieu of ngapi, to impart umami. Dried bean ngapi chips (ပဲပုပ်; lit. 'spoiled beans') are used as condiments for various Shan dishes.\nPon ye gyi (ပုံးရည်ကြီး), a thick salty black paste made from fermented beans, is popular in the Bamar heartland. It is used in cooking, especially with pork, and as a salad with peanut oil, chopped onions and red chili. Bagan is an important pon ye gyi producer.\nBurmese cuisine also features a wide variety of pickled vegetables and fruits that are preserved in oil and spices, or in brine and rice wine. The former, called thanat (သနပ်), are similar to South Asian pickles, including mango pickle. The latter are called chinbat (ချဉ်ဖတ်), and include pickles like mohnyin gyin.\n\n### Rice\nThe most common staple in Myanmar is steamed rice, called htamin (ထမင်း). Burmese varieties of rice are typically starchier than jasmine or basmati rice. Fragrant, aromatic varieties of white rice, including paw hsan hmwe (ပေါ်ဆန်းမွှေး), are popular. Lower-amylose varieties of glutinous rice, which are called kauk hnyin (ကောက်ညှင်း), also feature in Burmese cuisine, including a purple variety called ngacheik (ငချိပ်). Consumers in the northern highlands (e.g., Shan State) prefer stickier, lower-amylose varieties like kauk hnyin and kauk sei, while consumers in lower delta regions preferring higher-amylose varieties like kauk chaw and kauk kyan. Lower-amylose varieties of rice are commonly used in traditional Burmese snacks called mont. While rice is traditionally eaten plain, flavored versions like buttered rice and coconut rice are commonplace festive staples.\n\nHtamin gyaw (ထမင်းကြော် [tʰəmɪ́ɴ dʒɔ̀]) – fried rice with boiled peas, sometimes with meat, sausage, and eggs.\nSan byok (ဆန်ပြုတ် [sʰàɴbjoʊʔ]) – rice congee with fish, chicken or duck often fed to invalids.\nDanbauk (ဒံပေါက် [dàɴbaʊʔ], from Persian dum pukht) – Burmese-style biryani with either chicken or mutton served with mango pickle, a fresh salad of sliced onions, julienned cabbage, sliced cucumbers, fermented limes and lemons, fried dried chilies, and soup\nHtamin jin (ထမင်းချဉ်‌ [tʰəmíɴ dʒɪ̀ɴ]) – a rice, tomato and potato or fish salad kneaded into round balls dressed and garnished with crisp fried onion in oil, tamarind sauce, coriander and spring onions often with garlic, Chinese chive roots, fried whole dried chili, grilled dried fermented bean cakes (pé bok) and fried dried tofu (tohu gyauk kyaw) on the side\nThingyan rice (သင်္ကြန်ထမင်း [ðədʒàɴ tʰəmɪ́ɴ]) – fully boiled rice in candle-smelt water served with pickled marian plums\n\n### Noodles\nBurmese cuisine uses a wide variety of noodles, which are prepared in soups, salads, or other dry noodle dishes and typically eaten outside of lunch, or as a snack. Fresh, thin rice noodles called mont bat (မုန့်ဖတ်) or mont di (မုန့်တီ), are similar to Thai khanom chin, and feature in Myanmar's national dish, mohinga. Burmese cuisine also has a category of rice noodles of varying sizes and shapes called nan, including nangyi (နန်းကြီး), thick udon-like noodles; nanlat (နန်းလတ်), medium-sized rice noodles; nanthe (နန်းသေး), thinner rice noodles; and nanbya (နန်းပြား), flat rice noodles. Cellophane noodles, called kyazan (ကြာဆံ, lit. 'lotus thread') and wheat-based noodles called khauk swe (ခေါက်ဆွဲ), are often used in salads, soups, and stir-fries.\n\nDry or fried noodle dishes include:\n\nKat kyi kaik (ကတ်ကြေးကိုက် [kaʔtɕígaɪʔ], lit. 'bitten with scissors') – a southern coastal dish (from the Dawei area) of flat rice noodles with a variety of seafood, land meats, raw bean sprouts, beans and fried eggs, comparable to pad thai\nMeeshay (မြီးရှည် [mjíʃè]) – rice noodles with pork or chicken, bean sprouts, rice flour gel, rice flour fritters, dressed with soy sauce, salted soybean, rice vinegar, fried peanut oil, chilli oil, and garnished with crisp fried onions, crushed garlic, coriander, and pickled white radish/mustard greens\nMont di – an extremely popular and economical fast-food dish where rice vermicelli are either eaten with some condiments and soup prepared from ngapi, or as a salad with powdered fish and some condiments.\nPanthay khao swè (ပန်းသေးခေါက်ဆွဲ [páɴðé kʰaʊʔ sʰwɛ́]) – halal egg noodles with a spiced chicken curry. The dish is associated with Panthay community, a group of Burmese Chinese Muslims.\nSigyet khauk swè (ဆီချက်ခေါက်ဆွဲ [sʰìdʑɛʔ kʰaʊʔ sʰwɛ́]) – wheat noodles with duck or pork, fried garlic oil, soy sauce and chopped spring onions. The dish originated from with the Sino-Burmese community\n\nNoodle soups include:\n\nMohinga (မုန့်ဟင်းခါး [mo̰ʊɴhíɰ̃ɡá]) – the unofficial national dish, made with fresh thin rice noodles in a fish broth with onions, garlic, ginger, lemon grass and tender banana stem cores, served with boiled eggs, fried fishcake and Burmese fritters\nOhn-no khauk swè (အုန်းနို့ခေါက်ဆွဲ [ʔóʊɴno̰ kʰaʊʔsʰwɛ́]) – curried chicken and wheat noodles in a coconut milk broth. It is comparable to Malaysian laksa and Northern Thai khao soi\nKyay oh (ကြေးအိုး [tʃé ʔó]) – rice noodles in a broth of pork offal and egg, traditionally served in copper pot\nKawyei khao swè (ကော်ရည်ခေါက်ဆွဲ [kɔ̀ jè kʰaʊʔ sʰwɛ́]) – noodles and duck (or pork) curried with five-spice powder in broth with eggs, comparable to Singaporean/Malaysian lor mee\nMi swan (မြူစွမ် [mjù swàɴ]) – thin wheat noodles, known as misua in Singapore and Malaysia. It is a popular option for invalids, usually with chicken broth.\nShan khauk swé (ရှမ်းခေါက်ဆွဲ [ʃáɴ kʰaʊʔsʰwɛ́]) – rice noodles with chicken or minced pork, onions, garlic, tomatoes, chili, crushed roasted peanuts, young snowpea vine, served with tofu fritters, and pickled mustard greens\nTofu Nway (တိုဖူးနွေး; Shan: တူဝ်းဖူယုင်; literally \"warm tofu) - a warm, creamy Shan tofu dish made from yellow split peas.\n\n### Salads\nBurmese salads (အသုပ်; transliterated athoke or athouk) are a diverse category of indigenous salads in Burmese cuisine. Burmese salads are made of cooked and raw ingredients that are mixed by hand to combine and balance a wide-ranging array of flavors and textures. Burmese salads are eaten as standalone snacks, as side dishes paired with Burmese curries, and as entrees.\nLahpet thoke (လက်ဖက်သုပ် [ləpʰɛʔ ðoʊʔ]) – a salad of pickled tea leaves with fried peas, peanuts and garlic, toasted sesame, fresh garlic, tomato, green chili, crushed dried shrimps, preserved ginger and dressed with peanut oil, fish sauce and lime\nGyin thoke (ချင်းသုပ်‌ [dʒɪ́ɰ̃ ðoʊʔ]) – a salad of pickled ginger with sesame seeds\nKhauk swè thoke (ခေါက်ဆွဲသုပ် [kʰaʊʔsʰwɛ́ ðoʊʔ]) – wheat noodle salad with dried shrimps, shredded cabbage and carrots, dressed with fried peanut oil, fish sauce and lime\nLet thoke son (လက်သုပ်စုံ [lɛʔ θoʊʔzòʊɴ]) – similar to htamin thoke with shredded green papaya, shredded carrot, ogonori sea moss and often wheat noodles\nNan gyi thoke (နန်းကြီးသုပ် [náɰ̃dʒí ðoʊʔ]) or Mandalay mont di, thick rice noodle salad with chickpea flour, chicken, fish cake, onions, coriander, spring onions, crushed dried chilli, dressed with fried crispy onion oil, fish sauce and lime\nSamusa thoke (စမူဆာသုပ် [səmùsʰà ðoʊʔ]) – samosa salad with onions, cabbage, fresh mint, potato curry, masala, chili powder, salt and lime\nKya zan thoke – glass vermicelli salad with boiled prawn julienne and mashed curried duck eggs and potatoes\n\n### Curries\nBurmese curry refers to a diverse array of dishes in Burmese cuisine that consist of protein or vegetables simmered or stewed in an base of aromatics. Burmese curries generally differ from other Southeast Asian curries (e.g., Thai curry) in that Burmese curries make use of dried spices, in addition to fresh herbs and aromatics, and are often milder. The most common variety of curry is called sibyan (ဆီပြန်; lit. 'oil returns'), which is typified by a layer of oil that separates from the gravy and meat after cooked. Pork, chicken, goat, shrimp, and fish are commonly prepared in Burmese curries.\n\nPork sibyan (ဝက်သားဆီပြန်) – classic Burmese curry with fatty cuts of pork\nChicken sibyan (ကြက်သားဆီပြန်) – the classic Burmese curry, served with a thick gravy of aromatics\nBachelor's chicken curry (ကြက်ကာလသားချက်) – a red and watery chicken curry cooked with calabash\nGoat hnat (ဆိတ်သားနှပ်) – a braised goat curry spiced with masala, cinnamon sticks, bay leaf, and cloves\nNga thalaut paung (ငါးသလောက်ပေါင်း [ŋəθəlaʊʔbáʊɴ]) – a curry of hilsa fish and tomatoes, which is slowly simmered to melt the fish bones\nEgg curry (ဘဲဥချဥ်ရည်ဟင်း) – a sour curry made with hardboiled duck or chicken eggs, cooked in tamarind paste and mashed tomatoes\n\n### Soups\nIn Burmese cuisine, soups typically accompany meals featuring both rice and noodles, and are paired accordingly to balance contrasting flavors. Lightly flavored soups, called hin gyo (ဟင်းချို) are served with saltier dishes, while sour soups, called chinyay hin (ချဉ်ရည်ဟင်း), are paired with rich, fatty Burmese curries.\nThizon chinyay (သီးစုံချဉ်ရည် [θízòʊɴ tʃìɴjè], lit. 'sour soup of assorted vegetables'), cooked with drumstick, lady's finger, eggplant, green beans, potato, onions, ginger, dried chilli, boiled eggs, dried salted fish, fish paste and tamarind, is an elevated version of chinyay hin, and served during festive occasions.\n\n### Other grains and breads\nIndian breads are commonly eaten for breakfast or teatime in Myanmar. Palata (ပလာတာ), also known as htattaya (ထပ်တစ်ရာ), a flaky fried flatbread related to Indian paratha, is often eaten with curried meats or as dessert with sprinkled sugar, while nanbya (နံပြား), a baked flatbread, is eaten with any Indian dishes. Other favorites include aloo poori (အာလူးပူရီ), chapati (ချပါတီ), and appam (အာပုံ).\n\nOther dishes include:\n\nBurmese tofu (ရှမ်းတို့ဟူး [ʃáɴ tòhú]) – a tofu of Shan origin made from chickpea flour, eaten as fritters, in a salad, or in porridge forms\nA sein kyaw (အစိမ်းကြော် [ʔəséɪɴdʒɔ̀]) – cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, green beans, baby corn, corn flour or tapioca starch, tomatoes, squid sauce\nNgapi daung (ငါးပိထောင်း) – a spicy Rakhine-style condiment made from pounded ngapi and green chili\nNga baung htoke (ငါးပေါင်းထုပ် [ŋəbáʊɴ doʊʔ]) – a Mon-style steamed parcel of mixed vegetables and prawns, wrapped in morinda and banana leaves\nWet tha chin (ဝက်သားချဉ် [wɛʔ θə dʑɪ̀ɴ]) – Shan-style preserved minced pork in rice\n\n### Snacks\nBurmese cuisine has a wide variety of traditional snacks called mont, ranging from sweet desserts to savory food items that are steamed, baked, fried, deep-fried, or boiled. Traditional Burmese fritters, consisting of vegetables or seafood that have been battered and deep-fried, are also eaten as snacks or as toppings.\nSavory snacks include:\n\nHpet htok (lit. 'leaf wrap', ဖက်ထုပ် [pʰɛʔtʰoʊʔ]) – meat, pastry paper, ginger, garlic, pepper powder, and salt. Usually served with soup or noodles.\nSamusa (စမူဆာ [səmùzà]) – Burmese-style samosa with mutton and onions served with fresh mint, green chilli, onions and lime\nBurmese pork offal skewers (ဝက်သား တုတ်ထိုး [wɛʔθá doʊʔtʰó]) – pork offal cooked in light soy sauce, and eaten with raw ginger and chili sauce.\nHtamane (ထမနဲ [tʰəmənɛ́]) – dessert made from glutinous rice, shredded coconuts and peanuts\nSweet snacks include:\n\nMont let hsaung (မုန့်လက်ဆောင်း [mo̰ʊɴlɛʔsʰáʊɴ]) – tapioca or rice noodles, glutinous rice, grated coconut and toasted sesame with jaggery syrup in coconut milk\nSanwin makin (ဆနွင်းမကင်း [sʰà.nwɪ́ɴ məgɪ́ɴ]) – semolina cake with raisins, walnuts and poppy seeds\nShwe yin aye (ရွှေရင်အေး [ʃwè jɪ̀ɴ ʔé]) – agar jelly, tapioca and sago in coconut milk\nPathein halawa (ပုသိမ်ဟာလဝါ [pəθèɪɴ ha̰ləwà]) – a sticky sweetmeat made of glutinous rice, butter, coconut milk, inspired by Indian halwa\nHpaluda (ဖာလူဒါ [pʰàlùdà]) – rose water, milk, coconut jelly, coconut shavings, sometimes served with egg custard and ice cream, similar to Indian falooda\nNgapyaw baung (ငှက်ပျောပေါင်း) – A Mon-style dessert of bananas stewed in milk and coconut, and garnished with black sesame\nSaw hlaing mont (စောလှိုင်မုန့်) – a Rakhine-style baked sweet, made from millet, raisins, coconut and butter\n\n### Fruits and fruit preserves\nMyanmar has a wide range of fruits, mostly of tropical origin. Fruit is commonly eaten as a snack or dessert. While most fruits are eaten fresh, a few, including jengkol, are boiled, roasted or otherwise cooked. Popular fruits include banana, mango, watermelon, papaya, jujube, avocado, pomelo, and guava. Others include marian plum, mangosteen, sugar-apple, rambutan, durian, jackfruit, lychee, and pomegranate. Some fruits, including green mangoes, plums, and guavas, are traditionally eaten before they ripen, often mixed with chili powder and salt.\nBurmese fruit preserves, called yo (ယို), are also commonly eaten as standalone snacks. Common ones include fruit preserves made from fig, jujube, marian plum, citrus, mango, pineapple, and durian.\n300 cultivars of mango are grown in Myanmar, including seintalon (စိန်တစ်လုံး, lit. 'one diamond'), Ma Chit Su (မချစ်စု), and mya kyauk (မြကျောက်, lit. 'emerald stone'). 13 species of banana are locally cultivated in Myanmar, including the following cultivars:\n\nred - locally called shweni (ရွှေနီ, lit. 'golden red')\nDwarf Cavendish - locally called htawbat (သီးမွှေး, lit. 'fragrant fruit')\nMysore - locally called Rakhine (ရခိုင်), sweet and rounder in shape\nLatundan - locally called htawbat (ထောပတ်, lit. 'butter')\n\n## Beverages\nTea is the national drink of Myanmar, reflecting the influence of Buddhism and its views on temperance. Tea is central to Burmese dining culture; complimentary green tea is customarily served to diners at restaurants and teashops alike. Various liquid concoctions made from fruits and coconut milk, including sugarcane juice, and mont let hsaung (မုန့်လက်ဆောင်း) are also popular. Indigenous fermented drinks like palm wine are also found across the country. During a traditional Burmese meal, drinks are not often served; instead, the usual liquid refreshment is a light broth or consommé served from a communal bowl.\n\n### Burmese tea\nPlain green tea, yay nway gyan (ရေနွေးကြမ်း, lit. 'crude tea water'), is a popular form of tea drunk in Myanmar. Tea leaves are traditionally cultivated in Shan State and Kachin State. Milk tea, called laphet yay cho (လက်ဖက်ရည်ချို), made with strongly brewed black tea leaves, and sweetened with a customized ratio of condensed milk and evaporated milk, is also popular.\n\n### Alcohol\nPalm wine, called htan yay (ထန်းရည်), made from the fermented sap of the toddy palm, is traditionally consumed in rural parts of Upper Myanmar Ethnic communities, including the Kachin and Shan, also brew local moonshines. Several ethnic minorities traditionally brew alcoholic beverages using rice or glutinous rice called khaung (ခေါင်ရည်). The khaung of the Chin peoples is brewed using millet seeds. Locally brewed beers include Irrawaddy, Mandalay, Myanmar, and Tiger.\n\n## Food establishments\n\n\n### Restaurants\nDine-in restaurants that serve steamed rice with traditional Burmese curries and dishes are called htamin hsaing (ထမင်းဆိုင်; lit. 'rice shop'). At traditional curry shops, soup is typically served complimentary, alongside pickled and raw vegetables, chutneys and various seasonings.\n\n### Tea shops\nDuring British rule in Burma, Burmese Indians introduced tea shops to the country, first known as kaka hsaing, which later evolved into tea shops called laphet yay hsaing (လက်ဖက်ရည်ဆိုင်) or kaphi (ကဖီး), the latter word from French café. Burmese tea shop culture emerged from a combination of British, Indian, and Chinese influences throughout the colonial period. Tea shops are prevalent across the country, forming an important part of communal life. Typically open throughout the day, some Burmese tea shops cater to locals, long-distance drivers and travellers alike. The Burmese typically gather in tea shops to drink milk tea served with an extensive array of snacks and meals.\n\n### Street food\nStreet food stalls and hawkers are a feature of the Burmese urban landscape, especially in major cities like Yangon. Burmese salads, snacks, and fritters are especially popular street foods. In recent years, some major cities have clamped down on street food vendors. In 2016, Yangon banned the city's 6,000 street vendors from selling food on major thoroughfares, and relocated them to formal night markets set up by the city.\nNight markets, called nya zay (ညဈေး), are a feature of many Burmese towns and cities. Colonial observers as early as 1878 noted Burmese street hawkers selling delicacies, such as fruits, cakes, and laphet during \"night bazaars.\" The streets surrounding major daytime markets, such as Zegyo Market in Mandalay, typically double as makeshift night markets during the evenings.\n\n## See also\nRice production in Myanmar\n Food portal\n Myanmar portal\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nMyanmar Business Today; Print Edition, 27 February 2014.

    "text": "# Butter chicken\n\nButter chicken or Murgh Makhni (Hindi : मुर्ग मखनी) is a curry made from chicken cooked in a spiced tomato and butter-based (makhan) gravy. The gravy is known for its creamy, rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste. The dish originates in Delhi, India.\n\n## History\nThe curry was allegedly developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, who were both Punjabi Hindu refugees from Peshawar, in the North-West Frontier Province of British India. The curry was made \"by chance\" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato sauce, rich in butter (makhan). \nIn 1975, the English phrase \"butter chicken\" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan. In Canada and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls, while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present. Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly assumed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is sometimes confused with).\nIn 2024, the owners of restaurant sued a rival restaurant in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.\n\n## Preparation\nChicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste.\nThe marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and dried fenugreek leaves (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.\n\n## See also\nBiryani\nChicken curry\nDal makhani\nList of chicken dishes\nList of Indian dishes\nPaneer makhani\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\nCurry Club Tandoori and Tikka Dishes.

Cayenne and Louisiana-style hot sauce are the primary sources of spice in Cajun cuisine, which usually tends towards a milder, well-balanced heat, despite the national \"Cajun hot\" craze of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n## History\nThe Acadians are an ethnic group descended from French colonists who settled in what is today Eastern Canada in the early 17th century. In the mid-18th century, thousands were deported by the British during the French and Indian War in what they termed le Grand Dérangement, and many of them resettled in southern Louisiana where they are known as Cajuns.\n\nDue to the extreme change in climate from that of Acadia, Acadians were unable to cook their original dishes. Soon, their former culinary traditions were adapted and, in time, incorporated Native American and African American traditions—as exemplified in the classic Cajun dish gumbo, which takes its name from the word for its principal ingredient, okra, in the West African Bambara language. In Louisiana, the Acadian settlers replaced the whole-wheat bread they were accustomed to with cornbread, which by the beginning of the 19th century they were eating with cane syrup. Between 1790 and 1810 most Louisiana Acadians bought one to three enslaved black persons, many from the West Indies, from whom they learned the use of new ingredients, including okra. The ragu sauces that the Cajuns developed are very similar to sauces used in French West Africa, possibly introduced by enslaved cooks.\nMany other meals developed along these lines, adapted in part from Haiti, to become what are now considered classic Cajun cuisine traditions (in contrast to the more modern concepts associated with Paul Prudhomme's style).\nUp through the 20th century, the meals were basic, not elaborate. The public's false perception of \"Cajun\" cuisine was based on Prudhomme's style of Cajun cooking, which was spicy, flavorful, and not true to the classic form of the cuisine.\nCajun and Creole cuisine have mistakenly  been considered the same, but the origins of Creole cooking are in New Orleans, and Cajun cooking arose 40 years after its establishment. Today, most restaurants serve dishes that consist of Cajun styles, which Prudhomme dubbed \"Louisiana cooking\". In Cajun home cooking, these individual styles are still kept separate. However, there are fewer people cooking the classic Cajun dishes that would have been eaten by the original settlers.\n\n## Cultural aspects\nAccording to political scientist Kevin V. Mulcahy writing on cultural identity, Cajun cuisine today is different from that of the 19th and early 20th centuries, but still defines Cajun culture for many people within and outside Acadiana. Its heritage reflects French, Spanish, American Indian, German, and Afro-Caribbean influences. Cajun food is the result of this assimilation or \"cultural blending\". Rural Cajun cuisine is distinct from the urban Creole cuisine, having arisen by economic necessity among the Acadian immigrants who came to Louisiana in the 18th century. These settlers lived off the land and survived on foods they could obtain by hunting, fishing, ranching, foraging, or growing crops.\nAlthough there is a large variety of dishes within the regions that make up Cajun country in Louisiana, rural Cajuns generally prefer strong dark roast coffee, highly seasoned foods, hot peppers, vegetables smothered in brown gravy, and one-pot dishes served with rice. Each region has its own specialties, such as andouille sausage on the west bank of the Mississippi River above New Orleans, formerly known as the German Coast; barbecued shrimp in Terrebonne Parish; tasso ham made from hog's shoulder in the area around Opelousas; and crawfish all across the parishes of southern Louisiana, where they are abundant in the fresh water wetlands and waterways.\nMany Cajun recipes are based on rice and the \"holy trinity\" of  onions, celery, and green pepper, and use locally caught shellfish such as shrimp and crawfish. Much of Cajun cookery starts with a roux made of wheat flour cooked and slowly stirred with a fat such as oil, butter or lard,  known especially as the base for étouffée, gumbo and sauce piquante. Cajun cooks in south Louisiana historically have cooked meals in single pots, and still cook meats by braising. Almost all Cajun households had gardens up until the latter years of the 20th century, and lifted regional culinary standards by adding the fresh vegetables they grew to their dishes.\nThere was continuity in cuisines between the southern Bayou Teche area and the northern boundary of Cajun country in Avoyelles Parish. Fresh sausage, pork, and the use of salt and pepper as the main seasonings were universal in the region's foodway traditions, north and south. The role of seafood in the cuisine of the southern parishes distinguished it from that of the prairies, where more wild game was consumed instead.\nAnthropologist Charlotte Paige Gutierrez has written extensively on Louisiana's traditional foodways. She writes: \"The term foodways, as it is now used by writers in various disciplines, has a broad definition. The study of foodways may include the production, distribution, preparation, preservation, serving, and eating of food, as well as the social, symbolic, psychological, and behavioral aspects of food.\" Modern conveniences influenced Louisiana's culinary traditions: with the introduction of electricity and refrigerators, consuming freshly butchered meat immediately was not imperative as in the past, thus community events such as hog-killings (boucheries) occurred less frequently. Improved transportation and increased incomes made food stores more accessible and buying produce became more affordable for working families. Cajuns now bought their bread at a grocery store rather than baking their own. According to Gutierrez, when the economy of southern Louisiana boomed with the expansion of oil industry operations in the 1970s, Cajuns gained a renewed pride in their ethnicity.\nOnly those Cajuns who live near the coast are able to regularly harvest seafood such as crabs, oysters, shrimp, and saltwater fish directly from their habitats. Shrimping, crabbing, fishing, frog-gigging, and gardening have been practiced in Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes as subsistence and commercial pursuits for many generations. Before the introduction of modern transportation and refrigeration, Cajuns who lived in the southwestern prairie parishes away from the coast had little opportunity to incorporate seafood into their diets. Today, fresh seafood is available all across Acadiana, so that now it is regarded as a regional food rather than one available only to coastal residents.\nThe cooking traditions of the western prairies and those of the Bayou country in southeastern Louisiana overlap in the lower and middle Bayou Teche region. The complicated network of lakes, streams, bayous, and the flood plains with their rich soil characterize the terrain of Iberia, St. Martin, and St. Mary parishes. The traditional cuisine uses those resources available in the area: pork from hog farms on the plains and seafood from the lowlands.\nSeasoning practices in the Teche country occupy a middle place between the salt and black pepper-based approach to spices in the Bayou country and the prevalent use of cayenne pepper in the Cajun prairies. People along the lower and middle Teche use cayenne more often than in the Laforche area. Hot pepper sauce has a more dominant role in the Teche country cuisine than in other Cajun regions.\nIn the upper Teche region, wild game, freshwater fish, and pork are important in the local diet, with rabbit, duck, and venison being eaten more often than among their neighbors to southward. Avoyelles Parish, along the northern edge of Cajun country where cultural influences converge, shares some of these dietary features, although local cooking traditions are somewhat different than in the Teche country. Natives of the parish make fresh sausage, but cling to certain European customs, notably the preparation of cochon de lait róti, or roasted suckling pig. After the young pigs are slaughtered, they are suspended vertically by a rope tied to a tree limb and hang over a hardwood fire. For even cooking of the pig, it is rotated with a stick. Halfway through the roasting, the carcass is turned end for end to assure even heating of the meat. Local cooks have constructed improvised rotisseries, some fitting theirs with small motors for mechanized rotation.\nThe upper prairie, historically an area of small farms, ranches, and rice fields, has its own distinctive cuisine, well known for its smoked meats and boudin blanc, white sausage made of pork, rice, and seasonings. Local hardwoods such as oak, pecan, and hickory are used to smoke sausages and tasso. Smoked meats are comparatively rare, however, in other Cajun communities.\n\n## Cajun cooking methods\nBarbecuing—similar to \n\"low and slow\" Southern barbecue traditions, but with Creole/Cajun seasoning. A classic example is Johnson's Boucaniere (\"smokehouse\") in Lafayette, which was named best barbecue in Louisiana by the Food Network in July 2022. In the Ville Platte area, a unique sauce is made from dried onions reconstituted in water and vegetable oil thick with ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings. The flavorful oil that rises to the top is applied directly to meats being cooked as a baste. Two popular brands are Jack Miller's and Pig Stand, which are available online and in grocery stores across the state. This sauce is also commonly used on hamburgers, hot dogs, pork chops, chicken, and other grilled items.\nBaking—direct and indirect dry heat in a furnace or oven, faster than smoking but slower than grilling\nGrilling—direct heat on a shallow surface, fastest of all variants; sub-variants include:\nCharbroiling—direct dry heat on a solid surface with wide raised ridges\nGridironing—direct dry heat on a solid or hollow surface with narrow raised ridges\nGriddling—direct dry or moist heat along with the use of oils and butter on a flat surface\nBraising—combining a direct dry heat charbroil-grill or gridiron-grill with a pot filled with broth for direct moist heat, faster than smoking but slower than regular grilling and baking; time starts fast, slows down, then speeds up again to finish\nBoiling—as in boiling of blue crabs, crawfish, or shrimp, in seasoned liquid, often with side items like corn on the cob, whole new potatoes, and mushrooms cooked in the same boiling pot. A seafood boil is often a large outdoor social event.\nDeep frying—lightly breaded and fried seafood including various fish, shrimp, oysters, and soft-shell crab is universally popular in Cajun cuisine, often on French bread po-boys in the New Orleans style, along with traditional Southern favorites like fried chicken, fried okra, and pork chops.\nSmothering—cooking a vegetable or meat over low heat with the sauteed \"trinity,\" plus small amounts of water or stock, similar to braising. This forms a pan sauce or gravy, and the finished product is served over rice. Étouffée is a popular variant done with crawfish or shrimp. A meatless version might feature mushrooms and eggplant. Two commonly smothered meats are pork chops and round steak; these heartier meats may sometimes have a bit of roux added to the gravy.\nPan-broiling or pan-frying\nInjecting—using a large syringe-type setup to place seasoning deep inside large cuts of meat; this technique is much newer than the others on this list, but very common in Cajun cuisine\nStewing, also known as fricassée; a whole chicken cut into pieces is a popular choice for this method, particularly an older hen.\nDeep frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine. Blackening was actually an invention by chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1970s, becoming associated with Cajun cooking, and presented as such by him, but is not a true historical or traditional Cajun cooking process.\n\n## Ingredients\nIn the late 18th century, about the same time that Acadian musicians embraced the Spanish guitar, spices from the Iberian Peninsula were adopted in the Acadian cuisine. With the cross-cultural borrowing that took place between them and their neighbors in southern Louisiana, Acadians were eating African okra and American Indian corn by the time of the Louisiana Purchase (1803) in such dishes as gumbo, pain de maïs, and soupe de maïs, which did not closely resemble the African and Indian versions.\nThe following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.\n\n### Meat and seafood\nCajun foodways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.\nGame (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.\nThe recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in place of the more traditional wild-caught speckled trout.\n\nAndouille—a spicy smoked pork sausage, characterized by a coarse-ground texture and large-diameter casing.\nBoudin—a cooked sausage made with green onions, pork, and rice, and usually a large amount of ground pork or chicken livers. Boudin may be thought of as \"dirty rice in a casing.\" Some locals prefer to eat the sausage with the casing on, while others squeeze the contents out. Boudin filling is completely cooked before being stuffed into casings and may be consumed immediately after purchase, although it is also popularly grilled at cookouts. Pork blood is sometimes added to produce boudin rouge. Other versions can contain seafood, such as crawfish.\nChaurice, a sausage similar to Spanish chorizo\nChaudin or ponce—a pig's stomach, stuffed with spiced pork & smoked.\nHam hocks\nWild boar or feral hog\nHead cheese\nGratons—hog cracklings or pork rinds; fried, seasoned pork fat & skin, sometimes with small bits of meat attached. Similar to Spanish chicharrones.\nNew Orleans hot sausage—a spiced pork or beef sausage characterized by a reddish color.\nPork sausage (fresh)—distinctively seasoned and usually smoked, this sausage is often used in gumbos as is andouille, but it may also be grilled or pan-cooked to produce a rice and gravy dish. The sausage itself does not include rice, separating it from boudin. In Cajun country, a distinction exists between this sausage, which is simply called \"pork sausage,\" is finer ground, and uses smaller pork casings, and the similar andouille, which has a coarser grind and larger beef casings.\nSalt pork\nTasso—a highly seasoned, smoked pork shoulder\nBeef and dairy\nThough parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the US, although seasoned differently.\nDairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional Cajun and New Orleans Creole-influenced desserts are common.\n\n### Seasonings\nOnion (bell pepper, onion, and celery used together are known as the \"holy trinity\" of Cajun cuisine)\nThyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil are considered sweet herbs. In colonial times a herbes de Provence would be several sweet herbs tied up in a muslin.\n\n### Cooking bases\nDark roux—Cajuns inherited roux from the French. However, unlike the French, theirs is made with oil or bacon fat and more lately with olive oil, and not normally with butter. It is used as a thickening agent, especially in gumbo and étouffée.\nPreparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine, involving heating fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for about 15–45 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor. The temperature should not be too high, as a burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable.\nLight roux—The secret to making a good gumbo is pairing the roux with the protein. A dark roux, with its strong (dense) nutty flavor will completely overpower a simple seafood gumbo, but is the perfect complement to a gumbo using chicken, sausage, crawfish or alligator.\nA light roux, on the other hand, is better suited for strictly seafood dishes and unsuitable for meat gumbos for the reason that it does not support the heavier meat flavor as well. Pairing roux with protein follows the same orthodox philosophy as pairing wine with protein.\nStocks: Cajun stocks are more heavily seasoned than Continental counterparts, and the shellfish stock sometimes made with shrimp and crawfish heads is unique to Cajun cuisine.\n\n## Cajun dishes\n\n\n### Well-known dishes\nBoudin—a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, green onions and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, maque choux or bread. Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.\nGumbo—Among the best-known elements of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Contrary to non-Cajun or Continental beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply \"everything in the pot\". Gumbo exemplifies the influence of French, Spanish, African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine.\nThe origins of the word gumbo are in West Africa. Kellersberger Vass lists kingumbo and tshingombo as the Bantu words for okra, while John Laudon of the University of Louisiana says the word gombo is a French word that came to the Western Hemisphere from West Africa, where okra was known as (ki) ngombo along much of the region's coast.\nBoth filé and okra can be used as thickening agents in gumbo. Historically, large amounts of filé were added directly to the pot when okra was out of season. While a distinction between filé gumbo and okra gumbo is still held by some, many people enjoy putting filé in okra gumbo simply as a flavoring. Regardless of which is the dominant thickener, filé is also provided at the table and added to taste.\nMany claim that gumbo is a Cajun dish, but gumbo was established long before the Acadian arrival. Its early existence came via the early French Creole culture in New Orleans, where French, Spanish and Africans frequented, and it was later also influenced by Italian, German and Irish settlers.\nThe backbone of a gumbo is roux, as described above. Cajun gumbo typically favors darker roux, often approaching the color of chocolate or coffee beans. Since the starches in the flour break down more with longer cooking time, a dark roux has less thickening power than a lighter one. While the stovetop method is traditional, flour may also be dry-toasted in an oven for a fat-free roux, or a regular roux may be prepared in a microwave oven for a hands-off method. If the roux is for immediate use, the \"trinity\" may be sauteed in it, which stops the cooking process.\nA classic gumbo is made with chicken and andouille, especially in the colder months, but the ingredients vary according to what is available. Seafood gumbos are also very popular in Cajun country.\nJambalaya—The only certain thing that can be said about jambalaya is that it contains rice, some sort of meat (often chicken, ham, sausage, or a combination), seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish), plus other items that may be available. Usually, it will include green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. This is also a great pre-Acadian dish, established by the Spanish in Louisiana. Jambalaya may be a tomato-rich New Orleans-style \"red\" jambalaya of Spanish Creole roots, or a Cajun-style \"brown\" jambalaya which draws its color and flavor from browned meat and caramelized onions. Historically, tomatoes were not as widely available in Acadiana as the area around New Orleans, but in modern times, both styles are popular across the state. Brown is the style served at the annual World Jambalaya Festival in Gonzales.\nRice and gravy—Rice and gravy dishes are a staple of Cajun cuisine and is usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are deglazed and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice.\nThe dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast-iron pot, typically for an extended time period to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee.\n\n### Food as an event\n\n\n## List of Cajun-influenced chefs\nFrank Joseph Davis\nJohn Folse\nEmeril Lagasse\nPaul Prudhomme\nJustin Wilson\n\n## See also\nCuisine of New Orleans\nCuisine of the United States\nList of festivals in Louisiana\nLouisiana Creole cuisine\nAcadian cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Cambodian cuisine\n\nCambodian cuisine is the national cuisine of Cambodia. It reflects the varied culinary traditions of different ethnic groups in Cambodia, central of which is Khmer cuisine (Khmer: សិល្បៈធ្វើម្ហូបខ្មែរ, lit. 'Khmer culinary art'), the nearly-two-thousand-year-old culinary tradition of the Khmer people. Over centuries, Cambodian cuisine has incorporated elements of Indian, Chinese (in particular Teochew), French, and Portuguese cuisines. Due to some of these shared influences and mutual interaction, Cambodian cuisine has many similarities with the cuisines of Central Thailand, and Southern Vietnam and to a lesser extent also Central Vietnam, Northeastern Thailand and Laos.\nCambodian cuisine can be categorized into three main types: rural, elite and royal cuisine. Although there is some distinction between royal and popular cuisine, it is not as pronounced as in Thailand and Laos. Cambodian royal dishes tend to feature a wider variety of higher-quality ingredients and contain more meat.\n\n## Historical influences\n\n\n### 1st–9th century\nArchaeological evidence shows that by the 1st and 2nd centuries, the region's inhabitants had already settled in small communities that cultivated rice and raised animals. As early as the 1st century, the communities along the Mekong and the Tonlé Sap were growing rice and gathering seafood and fish from the sea, rivers, and lakes.\nAround the 2nd century, Indian merchants introduced many spices to Khmer cuisine. The Indian influence on cuisine among other aspects of Khmer culture was already noted by a Chinese visitor around 400 AD. From South India through Java, Khmer royal cuisine adopted the preparation of curry pastes, adding lemongrass and galangal to the recipe. According to Cambodian anthropologist Ang Choulean, the influence of Indian cuisine on rural Cambodian cuisine has been limited or even non-existent.\nA passage in the Book of Sui describes the diet of 7th-century Chenla inhabitants, noting that it \"includes a lot of butter, milk-curds, powdered sugar, rice, and also millet, from which they make a sort of cake which is soaked in meat juices and eaten at the beginning of the meal.\"\n\n### 9th–15th century\nBetween 9th and 15th century the culinary influence of the growing Khmer Empire spread beyond the borders of modern-day Cambodia into what is now Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Indonesia. According to Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan's account, onions, mustard, chives, eggplants, watermelons, winter gourds, snake gourds, amaranth and many other vegetables, as well pomegranates, sugarcane, lotus flowers, lotus roots, Chinese gooseberries, bananas, lychees, oranges, and many other fruits were available in the Khmer Empire in late 13th century.\nFood crops and other plants were actively cultivated and harvested in tropical gardens both in and around cities and temples of the Khmer Empire. Archaeobotanical investigations at Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm have identified macroremains of rice, sesame, mung beans, crepe ginger, black peppers, long peppers, and either citron or kaffir lime rind, as well as phytoliths from plants of Cucurbitaceae, Mus, Arecaceae, and Canarium families, while archaeobotanical investigations at 14th–15th century Angkor Thom have identified macroremains of rice, sesame, mung beans, pigeon peas, hyacinth beans, and yardlong beans.\nFor centuries, Khmer Empire was the dominant Indianized civilization in the region and its influence extended to the culinary arts. The Khmer Empire played a mediating role in transferring the Indian culinary influence now fundamental to Central Thai cuisine. The close affinity between Cambodian and Central Thai cuisine has been attributed to the extensive, centuries-long contact between the Khmer Empire and Ayutthaya Kingdom. The flavour principles of many Cambodian dishes, such as sour fish soups, stews and coconut-based curries, including steamed curries, share very similar flavour profiles with Central Thai cuisine. However, Cambodian dishes tend to use less chili and sugar, instead emphasizing aromatic spices such as cardamom, star anise, cloves, and nutmeg, along with lemongrass, ginger, galangal, coriander, and wild lime leaves.\nKhmer cuisine has also influenced Thailand's Isan cuisine and Khmer cuisine is very popular in the region's lower southern provinces of Surin, Sisaket and Buriram that have a large Northern Khmer population. Khmer-influenced dishes of the Surin province include sanlo chek, salot rao or kaeng phueak, ang kaep bop, and som jruk. As Thai tribes migrated southwards they were influenced by the Khmer practice of fermenting fish and adopted local ingredients, including prahok, which became imbedded in the Isan (as pla ra) and Lao cuisine (as padaek) from the time both Isan and Laos were part of the Khmer Empire.\nLao cuisine has influenced the cuisine of Cambodia through Lao migration into the country. Khmer cuisine has much less in common with Isan and Lao cuisines than with Central Thai cuisine.\n\n### 16th–18th century\nIn the beginning of 16th century, Portuguese merchants and explorers arrived in Cambodia, introducing a variety of fruits and vegetables from South America, Europe and other parts of Asia. These included papayas, tomatoes, pineapples, peanuts, cashews, avocados, vanilla, apples, passion fruit and sweet potatoes.  However, the Portuguese influence on Cambodian cuisine extended beyond just ingredients. The traditional Khmer dessert krob knor (គ្រាប់ខ្នុរ) is a direct descendant of Portuguese fios de ovos, and Cambodian egg cakes num barang (នំបារាំង) are also believed to have Portuguese origins.\n\nFrom the 18th century onwards, the ingredients and dishes of Mekong Delta's indigenous Khmer Krom, most notably spices (cardamom, cinnamon, star anise, clove, ginger, turmeric and ground coriander), curries and fermented food have influenced the cuisine of modern-day Southern Vietnam as large numbers of Vietnamese began settling in the area. Khmer Krom dishes, such as bún nước lèo, bún mắm and canh xiêm lo have been adopted by the region's Vietnamese and Chinese people, while Khmer Krom have adopted the Vietnamese lẩu mắm and canh chua and Chinese Yang Chow fried rice into their cuisine. Khmer specialties from the Sóc Trăng province, such as cốm dẹp and nom kapong (នំកំប៉ុង) have gained popularity throughout the Mekong Delta and other parts of Vietnam. Khmer-style crepes known as ọm chiếl are commonly sold in food stalls around the Mekong Delta, especially in Trà Vinh province. Conversely, the Vietnamese influence on Cambodian cuisine intensified during two centuries of Vietnamese rule in Cambodia. Dishes that Cambodian cuisine is believed to have been borrowed from the Vietnamese include beef lok lak and nem noeung.\n\n### 19th–20th century\nFrom 1863 to 1953, Cambodia was a French protectorate, which led to the adoption of French culinary elements into Cambodian cuisine. Baguettes, or more often demi-baguettes, have become common in Cambodia, often used to make sandwiches with butter, sardines in oil or with pâté. They are also eaten with curries as an alternative to fresh rice noodles or rice. For breakfast, slices of baguette topped with melted cheese, pork liver pâté, or sardines in oil are sometimes served alongside fried eggs or omelettes. The French introduced several ingredients to Cambodian cooking, such as potatoes, onions, butter, margarine, and carrots. Fried potatoes are featured in the so-called \"English\" version of lok lak, carrots are added to soups, lettuce leaves or sliced onions are incorporated in other Cambodian dishes. Butter and margarine have become preferred fats in Cambodian cuisine. Other Khmer adoptions from the French cuisine include coffee, condensed milk, chocolate, beer and wine. The French influence is shared with Vietnamese and Lao cuisine as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were all part of French Indochina.\n\nIn the decades following World War II, many Cambodian urban middle-class and elite families employed cooks trained in French cuisine, and the children of these households often did not learn cooking themselves. The transmission of Cambodian culinary knowledge was further disrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Cambodian genocide in the 1970s and 1980s. During the rule of Khmer Rouge, Cambodian cuisine was reduced to a plain rice gruel and Cambodians were forced to start catching and eating insects, frogs, snakes, snails and other small animals to avoid starvation. A lingering remnant of this era is the practice of eating fried spiders (a-ping), which are now sold as street food to tourists and still consumed by some locals, particularly in Skuon, for which it has earned the nickname Spiderville.\n\n### 21st century\nNowadays, more and more Asian fast food chains (such as The Pizza Company, Lotteria, Pepper Lunch, Yoshinoya and Bonchon) and Western fast food chains (such as Burger King, KFC, Krispy Kreme and Carl's Jr.) have entered the Cambodian market, especially in Phnom Penh, and fast food has become increasingly integrated into the Cambodian food scene, particularly among the younger generation.\nSince the early 2010s, an emerging grassroots culinary movement in Siem Reap, called \"New Cambodian Cuisine\", has gained momentum. It loosely consists of six Cambodian chefs and restaurateurs (Pola Siv, Sothea Seng, Pol Kimsan and Sok Kimsan, Mengly Mork and Pheak Tim) who are experimenting with and modernizing traditional Cambodian dishes. More recently, mobile applications dedicated to Khmer traditional recipes have also been developed, such as \"Khmer Cooking Recipe\" downloaded more than 100,000 times on Google Play and \"Khmer Cooking\".\n\n## Geographic variations\nIn Cambodia's coastal regions, dishes with saltwater fish are more common. Kampot was once renowned for its deep-fried pomfret with garlic, sugar, lime juice and chilies. The colonial resort town of Kep historically hosted numerous fine dining seafood restaurants along the promenade that after the city's destruction by Khmer Rouge in the 1970s have been replaced by individual vendors offering simpler seafood dishes, such as crabs sauteed with onions and black pepper, or pieces of dried squid, pounded or grilled over a wood fire served with pickled papaya and cucumbers.\nIn the northern part of the country, along the Cambodia–Thailand border, dishes are influenced by Thai cuisine and contain an increased amount of coconut milk, chillies and sugar. In northern Cambodia, dishes also include game meats, such as venison and wild bird meat, and bamboo shoots, popular in Lao cuisine, are more frequently used. In northwest Cambodia, remnants of the Khmer imperial cuisine are present, particularly in its steamed curries. In Cambodia's upland areas, the availability of wild vegetables is decreasing due to the enclosure of common forests and indigenous Khmer Loeu households are increasingly adopting Khmer-style cooking and meat-heavy diet introduced by Khmer migrants.\nThe differences between rural and urban cuisines are more pronounced than regional variations. Rural cuisine tends to be simpler, relying largely on ingredients that locals can grow or gather themselves. Beef is rare and while pigs and chickens are commonly raised, meat is used sparingly. Due to the high cost of spices and the labour-intensive process of grating meat and extracting coconut milk, curries are typically reserved for special occasions and holidays. In contrast, the ingredients in urban cuisine are more diverse and the dishes more developed, though there remains a notable difference between the food eaten by the poor and the wealthy. Some of the haute cuisine in urban areas originates in the imperial court.\n\n## Kitchen and eating utensils\nIn the Khmer Empire, kitchens earthenware pots were used to cook rice, and sometimes an earthenware stove was used to make sauces. Hearths were formed by burying three stones in the ground and ladles were made from coconut shells. Pottery dishes imported from China or copperware were used for serving rice, while sauce containers were made from leaves. Chiao leaves were also used to make single use spoons for carrying liquid to the mouth.\nThe south wall of the 12th/13th century Bayon temple depicts a Khmer kitchen, including its utensils, many of which are still used throughout modern Cambodia. According to local folklore, the 12th century Wat Athvea once housed an Angkorean-era royal open-air kitchen. They describe the temple's loose fallen stones as kraya cham-en meaning \"the preparation of the royal meal\" and talk about once-standing brick stoves and a wall where meat, baskets of ingredients, and utensils were hung. However, French archaeologist Claude Jacques contends that there is no archaeological evidence of a surviving Khmer Empire kitchen from that period. He believes the Bayon temple’s bas-reliefs and the writings of the Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan are the only surviving records of ancient Khmer kitchens.\nNowadays, Khmer rural kitchens are usually placed in an airy location, close, but separate from the main house to avoid smoke from firewood and undesirable odours from disturbing the main household. The most important Khmer kitchen utensils are:\n\nA mortar and pestle for making kroeung;\nA bamboo sieve for filtering prahok and ripe tamarind juice;\nEarthen stoves with varying heat intensity for cooking different dishes;\nA coconut grater;\nEarthen pots for cooking rice and soup, as well as storing water;\nJars for storing prahok, kapi and other ingredients.\nLoose bamboo baskets for storing vegetables.\nIn many kitchens, aluminium pots have replaced earthenware. Utensils are usually hung on the walls of the kitchen for easier access. With frying adopted from the Chinese, frying pans are also often found in modern Khmer kitchens. Although usually not considered part of the kitchen utensils, some houses may also have a larger mortar for grinding rice, and flat round bamboo trays for separating husk from the grain.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n\n### Rice\nBecause of Cambodia's geographic location, rice together with fish, especially freshwater fish, are the two most important sources of nutrients in the Cambodian diet. Rice is a staple food generally eaten at every meal.\nRice is believed to have been cultivated by the ancestors of the Khmers in the territory of Cambodia since 5,000 to 2,000 B.C. The advanced hydraulic engineering developed during the Khmer Empire allowed the Khmer to harvest rice and other crops three to four times a year. According to the International Rice Research Institute, there are approximately 2,000 rice varieties indigenous to Cambodia bred over the centuries by the Cambodian rice farmers. One of them – \"Malys Angkor\" (ម្លិះអង្គរ, Mlih Ángkô) – has been regarded as the world's best rice.\n\n### Fermented sauces\nIn Khmer, a distinction is made between fermented seafood depending on its consistency and the ingredient. Mam (មាំ) is the general term for seafood fermented with a special technique and usually includes more solid pieces of the fermented ingredient, whereas prahok (ប្រហុក, prâhŏk) and kapi (កាពិ, kapĭ) have more homogeneous consistency than mam.\nMam is prepared by adding a mixture of salt, roasted red sticky rice, and palm sugar to snakehead fillets and fermenting them for more than a year. The palm sugar and rice give mam an earthier and sweeter flavour and a reddish tone. Prahok, on the other hand, can either be made from small fish with all the bones and less salt (called prahok chhoeung) or large deboned fish and more salt (called prahok sach (ប្រហុកសាច់, prâhŏk săch)), which in turn can be made from larger fish (such as the striped snakehead (ត្រីរ៉ស់)) or smaller fish (such as trei kamplienh), with or without roe. Roe can be removed from the fish, cleaned, drained, and fermented separately. Kapi is made by pounding cleaned, dried, and salted shrimp into a homogeneous paste, sun-drying it for one day, pounding the paste again, sun-drying it for two more days, and pounding the paste for the final time to attain a viscous consistency.\nPrahok is used as flavouring for almost every Khmer dish, mixed with rice or served as a dipping sauce (ទឹកជ្រលក់, tœ̆k chrôluŏk). It can also be prepared into dishes of its own, such as  prahok k'tis (ប្រហុកខ្ទិះ, prâhŏk khtih), prahok kap (ប្រហុកកប់, prâhŏk káp), teuk khreung, teuk prahok prahok ang (ប្រហុកអាំង, prâhŏk ăng), and prahok chien (ប្រហុកចៀន, prâhŏk chiĕn). Fermented roe (ពងត្រី, pông trei) is primarily eaten with steamed eggs, omelettes, and other hen or duck egg dishes. Kapi is often mixed with sugar, garlic, lime juice, chili, and crushed peanuts and used as a dipping sauce for vegetables, fruit, meat, and fish.\nOther sauces used in the Cambodian cuisine include fish sauce (ទឹកត្រី, tœ̆k trei), oyster sauce (ទឹកប្រេងខ្យង, tœ̆k préng khyâng), soy sauce (ទឹកស៊ីអ៊ីវ, tœ̆k si-iv; តៅអ៊ីវ, tau iv; សាអ៊ីវ, sa-iv or ស៊ីអ៊ីវ, si-iv), tamarind sauce (ទឹកអម្ពិល, tœ̆k âmpĭl) and hoisin sauce (ទឹកសៀង). In particular, Kampot is known for its distinctive variety of fish sauce, made from locally sourced anchovies and valued for its rich, complex flavor.Fish sauce is an important ingredient in Khmer cooking, used to add saltiness to soups and noodle dishes, marinate meats, or as a dipping sauce for fish. Mixed with ingredients, such as garlic, ginger, and lime juice, it is used as a sauce for spring rolls, salads, and noodles.\n Oyster sauce was introduced by Chinese immigrants and has become a common ingredient in Cambodian cooking used to add a tangy-sweet flavour to meats and stir-fried vegetables. Oyster sauce, along with fish sauce and soy sauce, is commonly used together when seasoning foods. Soy sauce is also a common ingredient and condiment, mixed with garlic or aged radish to be eaten with primarily high-protein dishes, as well as used to add saltiness when fish sauce is not used. Tamarind sauce is made from tamarind paste mixed with fish sauce, garlic, chili peppers, lime juice, palm sugar, and vinegar.\n\n### Herbs and spices\nThe most common herbs and spices in Cambodian cuisine are sweet basil (ជីរនាងវង, chi néangvông), coriander (ជីរវ៉ាន់ស៊ុយ, chivănsŭy), hot mint (ជីរពងទាកូន, chi pông téa kon), turmeric (រមៀត, rômiĕt), garlic, ginger (ខ្ញី, khnhei), galangal (រំដេង, romdeng), kaffir lime leaves (ស្លឹកក្រូចសើច, slœ̆k kroch saeuch), neem leaves (ស្លឹកស្ដៅ, slœ̆k sdau), peppermint (ជីរអង្កាម, chi ángkam), lemongrass (ស្លឹកគ្រៃ, slœ̆k krey), chives (គូឆាយ, kuchhay), scallions, saw leaf herb (ជីរបន្លា, chi bánla), fingerroot (ខ្ខ្ជាយ, khchéay), and rice paddy herb.\nCertain regions in Cambodia are known for their spices. Kampot pepper and Kampong Speu palm sugar (ស្ករត្នោតកំពង់ស្ពឺ, Skor Thnaot Kompong Speu) have been granted Geographical Indications in Cambodia and protected geographical indication in the European Union. Cardamom Mountains in Southwest Cambodia are famous for their large population of wild cardamom plants.\nThe cultivation of peppercorns in Cambodia dates back to at least the 13th century, and because of its \"uniquely strong yet delicate aroma\" and \"slightly sweet eucalyptus taste,\" Kampot pepper is often regarded as the world's best pepper.\n\n### Vegetables\nVegetables are a major component in Cambodian cooking and the second highest quantity of foodstuff consumed after rice, making up 70–80% of a dish. The Cambodian diet consists heavily of leaf vegetables, such as water morning glory (ត្រកួន, trâkuŏn), cabbage (ស្ពៃក្តោប, spey kdaôp), Chinese kale (ខាត់ណាចិន, khăt-na chĕn), betel (ស្លឹកម្លូ, mlu), vine spinach (វល្លិ៍ជន្លង់, voă chónlóng), and watercress (ច្រាច់, crac), which are used in soups, stir-fries (ឆា, chá), and salads.\nCambodian cuisine also uses different squashes, such as bitter melon (ម្រះ, mreăh), winter melon (ផ្លែត្រឡាច, phlê trâlach), kabocha, and luffa (ននោង, nong); root vegetables, such as carrots (ការ៉ុត, karŏt), cassava (ក្ដួច, kduŏch), lotus rhizomes (ឫសឈូក, rœ̆h chhuk), potatoes (ដំឡូង, dámlong), radish (រ៉ាឌី, radi), sweet potatoes (ដំឡូងជ្វា, dámlong chvéa), and jicama (ដំឡូងរលួស, dâmlong rôluŏh or ប៉ិកួៈ, pĕkuŏk); and other vegetables, such as cucumbers (ត្រសក់, trâsák), eggplants (ត្រប់, tráp), tomatoes (ប៉េងប៉ោះ, péngpaôh), cauliflower (ផ្កាខាត់ណា, phka khăt-na), chayotes (ផ្លែស៊ូ, phlê su), shallots (ខ្ទឹមក្រហម, khtœ̆m krâhâm), yardlong beans (សណ្ដែកកួរ, sándêk kuŏ), and maize (ពោត, pot). Many unripe fruits, such as papaya, green banana, and mango, are also used as vegetables.\n\n### Fruits\nFruits in Cambodia are so popular that they have their own royal court. Durian (ទុរេន, tŭrén) is considered the \"king\", mangosteen the \"queen\", sapodilla (សាប៉ូឌីឡា) the \"prince\", and milk fruit (ផ្លែទឹកដោះគោ, phlê tœ̆k daôh ko) the \"princess\". Other popular fruit include kuy fruit (ផ្លែគុយ, phlê kŭy), romduol, pineapple (ម្នាស់, mnoăh), rose apple, jackfruit (ផ្លែខ្នុរ; phlê khnŏl), papaya (ល្ហុង, lhŏng), watermelon (ឪឡឹក, âulœ̆k), banana (ចេក, chék), mango (ស្វាយ, svay), rambutan (សាវម៉ាវ, sav mav), guava (ត្របែក, trɑbaek), longan (មៀន, miĕn), and tamarind (អម្ពិល, âmpĭl).\nAlthough fruits are usually considered desserts, some, such as ripe mangoes, watermelon, and pineapples, are commonly eaten with heavily salted fish with plain rice. Fruits are also made into smoothies (ទឹកក្រឡុក, tœ̆k krâlŏk). Popular fruits for smoothies are durian, mangos, and bananas. Sun-dried limes boiled in sugar and salt water are used in chicken and duck soups, sauces with fish, as well as beverages.\nSince 2018, Koh Trong pomelos (ក្រូចថ្លុងកោះទ្រង, kroch thlŏng Kaôh Trông) are recognized as one of the geographical indications in Cambodia. Pomelos grown in the Kratié Province's Koh Trong commune are known for their sweeter taste and the absence of seeds after ripening.\n\n### Fish and meat\nThere are more than 900 different freshwater and saltwater fish species found in Cambodia. Approximately 475,000 tons of fish (ត្រី, trei) are caught in Cambodia every year, and a Cambodian annually consumes 63 kg of fish on average. They are fried, dried, smoked, and fermented into prahok and fish sauce. Fish and fish-based products are eaten two to three times a day. Popular fish are snakeheads, snappers, catfishes (ត្រី, trei chleang), and mackerels. Cambodian chef Luu Meng has estimated that approximately 40–50% of Cambodian dishes are made with fish.\nIn the late-13th-century Khmer Empire, cows were only used for pulling carts, and geese had been recently introduced by the Chinese sailors. Since the 1980s, the role of meat in the Cambodian diet has increased significantly, and nowadays the consumption of meat, such as beef (សាច់គោ, săch koo), pork (សាច់ជ្រូក, săch chruk), and poultry, has become common, especially in the capital region. In Siem Reap, ground pork or beef is made into spicy or sweet and savoury sausages (សាច់ក្រក, săch krɑɑk (pork); ខ្វាគោ, kwa koo (beef)) that are eaten with steamed white rice, congee, or baguettes.\nOther seafood includes an array of shellfish such as crabs (ក្ដាម, kdaam), clams, cockles (ងាវ, ngiəw), crayfish (បង្កង, bang kang), shrimp, and squid (ត្រីមឹក, trei mik). Boiled or fried cockles seasoned with salt, chili, and garlic are sold as a popular street food. Giant freshwater prawns are usually only eaten by middle- and upper-class Cambodians because of their price. More unusual varieties of meat include frogs (កង្កែប, kɑngkaep; most commonly eaten are East Asian bullfrogs, rice field frogs, balloon frogs, banded bullfrogs, yellow frogs, and Asian common toads), turtles (អណ្ដើក, ɑndaək), and arthropods (such as tarantulas (សត្វអាពីង, sata ping), fire ants, grasshoppers (កណ្ដូប, kandoup), giant water bugs, and crickets (ចង្រិត, cɑngrət)). Crickets, water bugs, and tarantulas are seasoned with salt, sugar, and oil, deep-fried, and sold as street food.\n\n### Noodles\nCambodian noodles are made out of rice, wheat, and tapioca flour (បាញ់កាញ់, bañ kañ) in varying thickness. Wheat noodles, such as the hand-pulled noodles (មី (mii), a loanword from Teochew 面) and the thinner wheat vermicelli (មីសួ, mii suə), have been adopted from the Chinese cuisine and incorporated into distinct Cambodian noodle soups and stir-fries. Rice noodles include the indigenous lightly fermented num banhchok (នំបញ្ចុក), as well as rice vermicelli (គុយទាវ, kŭytéav), banh sung (បាញ់ស៊ុង, bɑɲ song), silver needle noodles (លត, lat), and banh hoi (បាញ់ហយ).\n\n## Food stalls\nIn Khmer, haan bai (ហាងបាយ lit. 'rice stall') is a generic term for food stalls serving both made-to-order and pre-prepared food (usually from large aluminum pots). In Phnom Penh, haan bai account for nearly four-fifths of all meals eaten outside the house, with pre-prepared food venues or soup-pot restaurants accounting for nearly three-quarters of meals eaten at a haan bai. Soup-pot restaurants are the most popular dining format among Cambodians and their popularity is inversely correlated with socioeconomic status.\nThe Khmer word haan (ហាង) is borrowed from Chinese háng (\"store\", \"business\"). More specifically, the stalls are referred to by the main food served—for example, rice noodle stalls (ហាងគុយទាវ, hang kŭytéav) or coffee stalls (ហាងកាហ្វេ, hang kafe).\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Stews and curries\nThe Khmer term samlor (សម្ល) encompasses a wide variety of stews and curries, which are staples in Cambodian cuisine. These curries are typically served with rice, fresh noodles, or a baguette. and often include seafood, chicken, beef, or pork. Vegetarian Cambodian curries are less common. Popular Cambodian curries are fish amok, num banhchok, kari sach moan, sour beef curry and curry leaf chicken. The word kari (ការី, kari) specifically refers to an Indian-style curry and is believed to be a loanword from Tamil. Curries play an important role in ceremonial occasions in Cambodia and are distinctive for their use of sweet potatoes, setting them apart from other Asian curries.\n\n### Stir-fries\nCambodian stir-fries combine aromatic ingredients with strong flavours, such as lemongrass, galangal, holy basil and garlic. An essential component of Cambodian stir-fry dishes is fish sauce and oyster sauce, which provide a pungent, umami-rich base, balanced by lime juice, palm sugar and other milder ingredients. The Khmer term cha (ឆា), borrowed from Chinese, refers to the method of sautéing or stir-frying, which has been integrated into Cambodian cuisine from Chinese cuisine and can be found as fried rice (បាយឆា, baay chaa) and fried noodles (មីឆា, mii chaa), among others. The Khmer verb kha (ខ), on the other hand, refers to the technique of stewing in soy sauce and could be ascribed to Vietnamese kho.\n\n### Salads\nVegetables and fruits are the foundation of many Cambodian salads; for example, green cabbage forms the basis of neorm salads. Fruits, especially unripe ones, are also frequently used, such as green papaya in bok lahong and green mango in nhoam svay. Common herbs in Cambodian salads include  lemongrass, mint, Asian basil, and cilantro. Popular spices that add pungency to these dishes are garlic, ginger, shallots, and Kampot pepper. Dressings and favouring, such as fish or soy sauce, lime juice, vinegar, and white or palm sugar, are often used to balance saltiness, acidity, and sweetness. Sugar is used to counterbalance the intensity of lime juice or other sour ingredients. Almost all Cambodian salads include some form of animal protein, such as beef, chicken, pork, or seafood, and sometimes even raw or marinated meat. Some of the most popular Cambodian salads are nhoam svay (ញាំស្វាយ), pleah sach ko (ភ្លាសាច់គោ), nhoam trasak, nhoam masour, nhoam kroch thlong (ញុំាក្រូចថ្លុង) and larb (which can be made with chicken, pork, or beef).\n\n### Desserts\nDesserts are eaten at the end of a meal or throughout the day as a snack by Cambodians. There are four main types of Cambodian desserts: rice-based desserts, fruit-based desserts, puddings (ចាហួយទឹក, cha houy teuk), and custards. Steaming and grilling are the most common cooking techniques for Cambodian desserts, whereas deep-frying is often used to make pastries as baking is not very widespread in Cambodia outside of commercial bakeries. For rice-based desserts, glutinous rice and rice flour are most frequently used. Popular Cambodian rice-based desserts are num ansom chek, num plae ai (នំផ្លែអាយ) and num chak chol (នំចាក់ចុល). In fruit-based desserts, fruit, such as mango, jackfruit, papaya, and guava, are often combined with pandan leaf extract, banana leaves, coconut milk, cream, or shavings. Bey dom neib is an essential fruit-based Khmer dessert that blends the fragrance and sweetness of ripe mangoes and coconut. Cambodian puddings are generally made with coconut milk or cream and tapioca pearls, and are eaten either hot or chilled, with ice cubes. Two common Cambodian puddings are with sweetcorn (បបរស្ករពោត, babor skor bot) and mung beans (បបរសណ្តែកខៀវ, babor sɑɑ tek khiəw).\n\n## Beverages\nWater is the most popular drink. As drinking water sources are not always easily accessible in rural areas water is boiled at home and consumed hot. In urban areas bottled water, as well as soda and sweetened fruit beverages, are available. Green tea (តែបៃតង, tê baitâng) is consumed throughout the day. It is believed to have been introduced in the Khmer Empire by the Chinese, but despite the growing consumption and suitable climate nowadays most green tea is imported and very little is grown locally. Camellia sinensis cambodiensis, a local strain of the tea plant, grows in the Kirirom National Park, in the remnants of a former 300-hectare tea plantation established in the 1960s by the King Norodom Sihanouk, and the area around Chamkar Te village in Mondulkiri Province. Recently, there have been efforts to revive the Cambodian tea production. Sweet tea (ទឹកតែស្ករ, tœ̆k tê skar) is also prepared and consumed.\nIn urban areas coffee (កាហ្វេ, kaafee) is also popular and is usually served with sweetened condensed milk rather than black. Coffee can be consumed either iced (កាហ្វេទឹកកក, kaafee tœ̆k kɑɑk) or hot. It is sold in coffee carts, coffeehouse chains and specialty coffee shops. More than 90% of all coffee in Cambodia is imported from other countries, such as Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand.\nSmoothies (ទឹកផ្លែឈើលាយ, tœ̆k krɑlok) are made out of mixed fruit juice and are sold in food markets. Soy milk (ទឹកសណ្ដែក, tœ̆k sɑndaek) is sold in the morning by street vendors; the green version is sweetened and thicker than the unsweetened white. Served either hot or cold, sweetened or unsweetened. Sugarcane juice (ទឹកអំពៅ, tœ̆k ʼɑmpɨw) is also a popular street drink made by pressing the juice out of sugarcane stalks with a special machine. Served with ice and sometimes flavoured with citrus to balance the sweetness. Pandan juice (ទឹកតើយ, tœ̆k taeuy) is made from the extract of pandan leaves and usually sold in Cambodian food stalls.\n\n### Fermented beverages\nFive fermented alcoholic beverages were produced in the late-13th century Khmer Empire: mead, pengyasi made from the leaves of an unidentified plant, baolengjiao made from rice hulls and rice leftovers, \"sugar-shine wine\" made from sugar and palm starch wine made from the starch of the leaves of a palm growing on the riverbank.\nNowadays, the most popular alcoholic beverage is beer (ប៊ីយេរ, biiyɛɛ). The first domestically brewed beer was produced in the 1930s during the French Indochina period by the Brasseries & Glacières de L'Indochine company in Phnom Penh. In 1995, the annual beer consumption per capita was only around two liters, but by 2004 it began to rise significantly and in 2010 beer overtook spirits as the most popular alcoholic beverage in Cambodia. Currently, the four biggest beer producers in Cambodia are the Cambrew Brewery, Cambodia Brewery, Khmer Brewery and Kingdom Breweries. Recently, there has also been a quickly growing craft beer scene with 12 brewpubs or microbreweries operating in Cambodia in 2019.\nIn rural areas, rice wine (ស្រាស, sra sa) and palm wine (ទឹកត្នោតជូរ, tœ̆k tnaot cuu) are the most consumed alcoholic beverages. Rice wine is produced by fermenting boiled and dried rice with a natural fermentation starter (dom bai) for at least 24 hours and distilling the resulting mixture. Modern distillation methods were introduced during the French Indochina period. Occasionally, there have been instances of methanol poisoning from low quality home-made rice wine. Rice wine can be infused with various herbs, roots, bark and insects to create medicinal rice wines (srah tinum). A popular drink infused with deer antlers and different herbs is the Special Muscle Wine manufactured since 1968 by Lao Hang Heng Wine. The company also produces popular Golden Muscle Liquor and Wrestler Red Wine, whereas Sombai manufactures a line of premium infused rice wines.\nPalm wine is a lower-prestige alcoholic beverage. It might have become popular during the French Indochina period as a cheap alternative to other wines. Palm wine is produced by fermenting Asian palmyra palm sap either through spontaneous fermentation by adding several plants to the sap and hanging the containers on trees or through the addition of a fermentation starter (ម៉ែទឹកត្នោតជូរ, mae tœ̆k tnaot cuu) made from fermented palm sap and various dried plant xylems and bark. Confirel in Pou Senchey District uses the Champagne method to produce sparkling palm wine under the name \"Thnot Sparkling Mekong Wine\".\nA regional beverage of the Mondulkiri province is yellow and purple passion fruit wine, while wine from jambolan is produced by a company in Takéo province. Samai Distillery, Cambodia's first rum distillery, produces rum and even uses Kampot peppercorns in one of its products. Cambodia's first and only winery Chan Thai Choeung In Battambang has been commercially producing grape wine since 2005.\n\n## Meals and eating etiquette\nIn Cambodia, meals are usually freshly prepared three times a day (for breakfast, lunch and dinner), although in rural areas only breakfast and dinner may be eaten. Due to a general lack of refrigeration, leftovers are usually discarded. A typical Cambodian breakfast consists of rice porridge with dried salted fish, rice with dried salted fish and vegetables, baguette with condensed milk or rice/egg noodles with meat and leaf vegetables. For lunch and dinner, Cambodians usually eat steamed rice, soup with meat (fish, pork, chicken or beef) and leaf vegetables, fried fish or other meat and fruit. In the wet season, Cambodian meals contain considerably more rice, vegetables, starchy root vegetables and tubers, as well as condiments and spices.\nIn Cambodian meals just like the rest of Southeast Asia, all dishes are served and eaten simultaneously, as opposed to the European course-based meal format or the Chinese meal with overlapping courses. The only exception is if the meal contains French-style dishes, in which case the dishes are served in courses. A number of side dishes are usually served alongside the main dishes. In addition to that, a variety of condiments, such as chili jam, pickled green chillies, sugar, garlic flakes, fish sauce and soy sauce, are also available. While steamed rice and soups are usually served hot, side dishes may be served at room temperature. The balance of flavours and satisfaction of individual preferences are achieved by combining the individual dishes and rice. For example, a Cambodian meal may consist of a sour soup, a salty fish, fried vegetables and plain rice, which is different from Thai food where sourness, saltiness, sweetness and spiciness are usually contained within a single dish.\nKhmer food is traditionally eaten with hands, but nowadays spoons, forks and chopsticks are also used. Knives are rarely used as the majority of Cambodian food is already cut into bite-sized pieces. Forks and spoons were introduced by the French and are used for eating rice and/or soup-based dishes, whereas chopsticks were introduced by the Chinese and are used only for eating noodle dishes.\n\n## International popularity\nUnlike the neighboring Vietnamese or Thai cuisines, Cambodian cuisine is not very known across the world. Food Republic has described Cambodian cuisine as \"The Greatly Underappreciated Outlier In Asian Cooking\". Fodor's Travel has called Cambodian cuisine \"the most underrated in Southeast Asia\" and Siem Reap \"SE Asia’s Most Underrated Food Destination\", while the magazine Time Out has named Kep one of \"18 of the world’s most underrated food cities\"\n\nOver the past three decades, the West has fallen in love with the cuisines of Thailand, southern China, Vietnam and Malaysia, even Burma (for its barbecue), but somehow, Cambodia's food has slipped through the cracks.\nOutside of Cambodia, Cambodian cuisine can generally be found in countries with sizeable Cambodian diaspora, such as the United States, France, Australia and Canada, especially in the Little Cambodia ethnic enclaves, but it is often aimed towards the local Cambodian community. Due to commercial considerations and the ethnic composition of the Cambodian diaspora many Cambodian-owned restaurants have chosen to serve the better-known Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese food instead, making most of them a fusion restaurant instead of a Cambodian focused one.\n\n## Culinary diplomacy\nIn December 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation launched an official \"Food Diplomacy 2021–2023\" campaign as part of a larger economic diplomacy strategy. At the launch Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Prak Sokhonn listed prahok, fish amok, nhoam kroch thlong, samlor kako, samlor ktis, prahok ktis and num banhchok as some of the Khmer dishes to be promoted in the campaign. The ministry also established a program to train Cambodian cooks for serving in Cambodian embassies and a program for providing ambassador spouses with knowledge about the Khmer cuisine.\nIn February 2021, the ministry published a cookbook The Taste of Angkor as a culinary promotion tool for Cambodian diplomatic missions abroad. A 1960 Cambodian cookbook and culinary guide \"The Culinary Art of Cambodia\" by Princess Norodom Rasmi Sobbhana republished in May 2021 by Angkor Database was also included in the campaign. In June 2021, a series of promotional videos under the slogan \"Taste Cambodia\" featuring Khmer foods and culinary activities in different Cambodian regions commissioned by the Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia were released. In May 2022, culinary training and representation facilities under the name of \"Angkor Kitchen\" were unveiled at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.\n\n## Awards\n\n\n### Cookbooks\nThe cookbook \"From Spiders to Water Lilies, Creative Cambodian Cooking with Friends\" published by non-governmental organization Friends-International has received the 2009 Gourmand World Cookbook Award as the \"Best Asian Cuisine Cookbook\", becoming the first book from Cambodia to win the award.\nThe French-language Khmer cookbook Au Pays de la Pomme Cythère, de Mère en Fille, Authentiques Recettes Khmères written and self-published by Kanika Linden and her mother Sorey Long has won the 2010 Gourmand Awards as the world's \"Best Asian Cuisine Cookbook\". The English-language version of the book \"Ambarella, Cambodian Cuisine\" has won the 2013 Gourmand Awards as the \"Best Asian Cuisine Cookbook\" in the UK and world's \"Best Asian Cuisine Cookbook\" in 2014.\nThe cookbook \"The Taste of Angkor\" published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Cambodia has won the 2021 Gourmand World Cookbook Award as the \"Best Asian Cookbook\" and 2022 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards as the \"Best Asian Cuisine Book\" and \"Heads of State/Food\" for the book's foreword written by Deputy Prime Minister Prak Sokhon.\nThe republished Cambodian cookbook and culinary guide The Culinary Art of Cambodia has received the \"Special Award of the Jury\" at the 2022 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards. Rotanak Ros' cookbook \"Nhum: Recipes from a Cambodian Kithchen\" has received 2020 Gourmand Awards in the \"Woman chef Book\" and \"Published in Asia\" categories and her second cookbook \"SAOY – Royal Cambodian Home Cuisine\" has received Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in the categories \"Best Of The Best\", \"Asian-Books\" and \"Heads Of State\".\n\n### Restaurants\nJoannès Rivière's Cuisine Wat Damnak has been included in position No. 50 of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants in 2015, becoming the first Cambodian restaurant to make the list. In the 2016 list it rose to the 43rd position. In 2020, the restaurant Embassy spearheaded by the Kimsan Twins was included in the Asia's 50 Best Restaurants newly created 50 Best Discovery list.\n\n### Chefs\nCambodian chef Luu Meng has received Asia's Top Chef award from the Malaysia-based business and lifestyle magazines \"Top 10 of Malaysia\" and \"Top 10 of Asia\" in 2014.\nCambodian chefs from the Cambodia Chefs' Association have won the 2019 ASEAN Gourmet Challenge with three gold medals, as well as received six silver and 17 bronze medals in the Global Pastry Chefs Challenge and Global Young Chefs Challenge categories at the Thailand Ultimate Chef Challenge taking place from 28 May to 1 June in Bangkok.\n\n## See also\nKhmer royal cuisine\nCambodian Chinese cuisine\nKula cuisine\nCham cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\nDe Monteiro, Longteine; Neustadt, Katherine (1998).

Regional cuisines have continued to develop with subsequent waves of immigration during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, such as from Central Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and the Caribbean. There are many culinary practices and dishes that can be either identified as particular to Canada, such as fish and brewis, peameal bacon, pot roast and meatloaf, or sharing an association with countries from which immigrants to Canada carried over their cuisine, such as fish and chips, roast beef, and bannock.\n\n## Definitions\nThough certain dishes may be identified as \"Canadian\" due to the ingredients used or the origin of their inception, an overarching style of Canadian cuisine may be more difficult to define. Some commentators, such as former prime minister Joe Clark, believe Canadian cuisine to be a collage of dishes from a variety of cultures. Clark has been paraphrased to have noted that \"Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a smorgasbord.\" Canadian food culture writer and author Jennifer Cochrall-King has said that \"there is no single definition of Canadian cuisine. It starts with ingredients that spring from the landscape and with traditional dishes steeped in the region's history and culture.\"\nWhile the immense size of Canada, and the diversity of its inhabitants, compounds the difficulty in identifying a monolithic Canadian culinary tradition, Hersch Jacobs acknowledges that the lack of a hegemonic definition does not preclude the existence of Canadian cuisine. Lenore Newman argues that there is a distinctly Canadian creole cuisine, and identifies five key properties that together define Canadian cuisine: its reliance on seasonality, multiculturalism, wild foods, regional dishes, and the privileging of ingredients over recipes. This adaptation, preparation, and emphasis on specific local ingredients is of particular note, and a common theme in Canadian food is the use of foreign recipes, introduced by immigrants and their descendants, that have been modified for use of local products. Tourtière, for example, is a Canadian meat pie of French origin that can be cooked with beef, pork or fish. The sections on regionality and national foods below illustrate this tradition of diversity and emphasis on local elements, such as dulse and lobster in the Maritimes, deer meats in the Northern Territories, salmon and crab in British Columbia, or maple syrup in Central Canada.\nIndigenous food may be considered uniquely Canadian, and the influence of Métis culture can be considered to have played a particularly important role in the origin of a distinct Canadian cuisine. Foods such as bannock, moose, deer, bison, pemmican, maple taffy, and Métis stews, such as barley stew, are all either traditional Indigenous foods, or originate from Canada with roots in Indigenous cuisines, and are eaten throughout the country.\nThere are many foods of foreign origin that are eaten commonly and considered integrated constituents of Canadian cuisine. Pierogies (dumplings of Central and Eastern European origin) are an example, due to the large number of early Ukrainian and Polish immigrants, while the ubiquity of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding are an example of the heavy English influence. As much of Canadian cuisine is coloured by the adaptation and development of dishes brought over by European, and later Asian, settlers, there is a variety of noteworthy Canadian variations on pre-established templated food and drink, with their own nationally defined particularities, such as Canadian Cheddar cheese, whisky, bread, wine, bacon, and pancakes.\nIn general, much of what is considered to be traditional Canadian cuisine contains strong elements of richness, breads and starches, game meat, and often stews and soups. Certain culinary traditions in Canada, such as the frying of dough, which developed out of the country's voyaging and frontier culture, have seen to both the creation of distinct national foods and the flourishing of a broader national association with certain types of dishes. In the case of frying dough, for example, particular foods originating from Canada would include beavertails, apple fritters and toutons, whilst foods such as doughnuts, cronuts, bannock, bagels, and pancakes, though not physically originating from Canada, have nonetheless developed within a broader tradition of nationally recognized cuisine.\n\n## History\nCanadian cuisine has been shaped by the historical and ongoing influences of Indigenous peoples, settlers and immigrants. Indigenous influences remain prevalent in Canada's contemporary food scene, alongside those of the three major immigrant groups of the 17th and 18th centuries: English, Scottish, and French. This diversity has been further expanded by subsequent waves of immigration in later centuries.\n\n### Indigenous\nThe traditional Indigenous cuisine of Canada is based on a mixture of wild game, foraged foods, and farmed agricultural products. Indigenous peoples are known to gather more than five-hundred plant species for food. They cultivate and forage a variety of plants, hunt a diversity of animals, and use various tools to boil, smoke/preserve and roast their food. Each region of Canada, with its own First Nations and Inuit, utilizes local resources and distinct preparation techniques for their cuisines.\nMaple syrup was first collected and used by the Indigenous peoples of Eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, and Canada remains the world's largest producer. Though the origin of maple syrup production is not clear, the earliest known syrups were made by repeatedly freezing the collected maple sap and removing the ice to concentrate the sugar in the remaining sap. Maple syrup is one of the most commonly consumed Canadian food of Indigenous origin.\nDried meat products such as pânsâwân and pemmican are commonly consumed by the Indigenous peoples of the plains. In particular, the former was a predecessor for North American-style beef jerky, with the processing methods adapted for beef.\nIn most of the Canadian West Coast and Pacific Northwest, Pacific salmon is an important food resource to the First Nations peoples, along with certain marine mammals. Salmon are consumed fresh during the spawning season, or smoked dry to create a jerky-like food that can be stored year-round. The latter food is commonly known and sold as \"salmon jerky\".\nWhipped soapberry, known as sxusem (sk-HOO-shum, \"Indian ice cream\") in the Interior Salish languages of British Columbia, is consumed similarly to ice cream or as a cranberry-cocktail-like drink. It is known for being a kidney tonic, which are called agutak in Arctic Canada (with animal/fish fat).\n\nIn the Arctic, Inuit traditionally survived on a diet consisting of land and marine mammals, fish, and foraged plant products. Meats were consumed fresh, but also often prepared, cached, and allowed to ferment into igunaq or kiviak. These fermented meats have the consistency and smell of certain soft aged cheeses. Snacks such as muktuk, which consist of whale skin and blubber is eaten plain, though occasionally dipped in soy sauce. Chunks of muktuk are sliced with an ulu prior to or during consumption.\nFish are eaten boiled, fried, and prior to today's settlements, often in dried forms. The so-called \"Eskimo potato\", (Inuit: oak-kuk: Claytonia tuberosa) and other \"mousefoods\", are some of the plants consumed in the Arctic.\nFoods such as \"bannock\", popular with First Nations and Inuit, reflect the historic exchange of these cultures with European fur traders, who brought with them new ingredients and foods. Common contemporary consumption of bannock, powdered milk, and bologna by Indigenous Canadians reflects the legacy of Canadian colonialism in the prohibition of hunting and fishing, and the institutional food rations provided to Indian reserves. Due to similarities in treatment under colonialism, many Native American communities throughout the continent consume similar food items, with some emphasis on local ingredients.\n\n### North and West European\nSettlers and traders from the British Isles account for the culinary influences of early English Canada in the Maritime provinces and Southern Ontario (Upper Canada). Cuisines found in Newfoundland and the Maritimes derive largely from British and Irish cooking, with a preference for salt-cured fish, beef, and pork. Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia also maintain strong British culinary traditions. The French settlers of New France, who would become the Canadiens and Acadians, account for much of the cuisine of southern Quebec (Lower Canada), Northeastern Ontario, and New Brunswick.\nSeafood had an important influence on the early European settlers and explorers of Atlantic Canada, which continues to be expressed in Maritime cuisine and culture to this day. In the late 15th-century, John Cabot's journey to the shores of what would become Newfoundland brought England knowledge of the Grand Banks and their abundance in cod. He is reported to have told King Henry VII that \"the sea was covered with fish which could be caught not merely by nets, but weighted basket lowered into the water.\" Fleets of fishermen from England, France, Portugal, and Spain flocked to Newfoundland to return with fish, filling a market need in Europe and cutting out the necessity of importing from Iceland. The English, Scottish, Irish, and French settlers of what would become the Atlantic provinces frequently built their communities beside the ocean and rivers for easy access, and the fishing industry along the Canadian east coast steadily expanded until it became the region's major industry. Accounts from early settlers list fish that were caught, sold, and incorporated into local meals, such as trout, eels, mackerel, oysters, lobsters, salmon, cod and herring. Meals that incorporated such fish included, and continue to include, fried cod roe, fried or baked cod tongues, stewed or fried cod heads, fish hash, codfish balls, cod sounds, toast and fish, roasted scrawn, fish and brewis, salt fish and potatoes, and boiled rounders, among others. The abundance of seafood and the ease by which it could be obtained made the British and French colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Acadia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador attractive destinations for settlers.\n\nThe influx of United Empire Loyalists into British North America in the 18th century, and the subsequent establishment of Upper Canada, saw the wider expansion of British cooking with indigenous ingredients in the future province of Ontario. These settlers established customs similar to their compatriots in England, but with a particular focus on dietary staples, such as meat, bread, and tea. Local forage and game were typically incorporated into the cooking of early English-Canadians in Upper Canada, such as wild berries, maple sugar, venison, partridge, waterfowl, maize, pumpkin, and turkey. Meals often contained more meat than was typical in England and were particularly reliant on pork and potatoes during early settlement, although these meals began to include beef and mutton as farming became more established in the region. Roasting was a common method of cooking for Upper Canadians, and Scottish immigration, largely onset by the Highland Clearances, brought a wider emphasis on mutton.\n\nThe Victorian era saw a greater swell of British immigration to Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and the Atlantic colonies; further, the urban and rural development that followed encouraged the spread of eating establishments, local cookbooks, and a busier ingredients market. By the mid-19th century, there was a tavern every couple odd miles along the major roads of Upper Canada; reportedly, there were 29 such establishments along the route between Halifax and Digby, Nova Scotia alone. The larger urban centres, such as Toronto, Kingston, and Coburg in Upper Canada, Montreal and Quebec City in Lower Canada, and Halifax in Nova Scotia, saw the opening of hotels that could better serve a burgeoning upper class of Victorian patrons. These hotels, broadly, provided beef steak, fried pork, buckwheat cakes, roast beef and pork, wild game and fowl, vegetables, pudding, and tea. Cookbooks published during this period include The Home Cookbook (1877) and The Galt Cook Book (1898). Traditions that developed out of the Victorian era in Canada include the Victorian cooking fireplace, which saw continued use in homes and restaurants even after the metal stove was introduced, and picnics, which often involved ham, fowl, meat pies, tarts, and cakes.\nIn the territory of Rupert's Land, the development of communities throughout the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries, which centred around Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company trading posts, saw to the intermingling of European (largely Scottish and French) traders, clerks, guides, and canoers with the local Indigenous population. The resulting genesis of the Métis culture saw to the development of cuisine in the Canadian West which combined the culinary traditions of these previously separate groups.\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk and his Scottish retinue (people largely displaced by the Highland Clearances), as well as the purchase of forty-five million acres of land in the Red River Valley, many Scottish culinary traditions were brought to the region. These foods included black bun, haggis, honey cakes, and rowies. Cooperation with the local Métis saw Scottish immigrants hunting buffalo and incorporating game into their meals.\nThe completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th-century led to a significant influx of not just settlers of British origin, but of also a multitude of different backgrounds, notably Ukrainian, Polish, German, Scandinavian, Belgian, Dutch, Greek, Czech, Slovak, Chinese, American, Mennonite, and Jewish. It is in this way that the Canadian Prairies, or the future provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, were a frontier of multicultural community-building in Canada, and the creation of a regional cuisine which absorbed influences from a variety of ethnic, national, and religious backgrounds.\nIcelandic immigration has a particular influence on the cuisine of Manitoba, which, besides Iceland itself, has a larger Icelandic population than anywhere else in the world. One example is vinarterta, a layer cake filled with prune jam and flavoured with cardamom, and a popular Christmas treat in Manitoba. Bakeries in the province often include other pastries brought over and adapted from Iceland, including kleinur (similar to doughnuts), laufabrauð (flatbread decorated with patterns), kransakaka (a type of cake with almonds), and ugbraud (a rye bread).\nOntario's southwestern regions also have strong Dutch and Scandinavian influences.\n\n### Central and East European\nIn Canada's Prairie provinces, which saw significant immigration from Eastern and Northern Europe in the pre-WWI era, Ukrainian, German, and Polish cuisines are strong culinary influences. Such examples include perogies, kielbasa, and babka. Emigration from Russia to Western Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries also established a Doukhobor influence, noted in particular for its emphasis on vegetarian recipes on the cuisine of the British Columbia Interior and the Prairies.\nThe Waterloo, Ontario, region and the southern portion of Manitoba have traditions of Mennonite and German cookery.\nJewish immigrants to Canada during the late 1800s played a significant culinary role within Canada, chiefly renowned for Montreal-style bagels and Montreal-style smoked meat. A regional variation of both emerged within Winnipeg, Manitoba's Jewish community, which also derived Winnipeg-style cheesecake from New York City recipes. Winnipeg has given birth to numerous other unique dishes, such as the schmoo torte, smoked goldeye and \"co-op style\" rye bread and cream cheese.\n\n### East Asian\nChinese immigration to Canada, beginning predominantly in the 1850s, saw to the local modification of dishes imported from Qing China. Much of what are considered to be \"Chinese dishes\" in Canada are largely Canadian or North American inventions, with Chinese restaurants having tailored their traditional cuisine to local tastes, local ingredients, and a largely non-Chinese clientele. This \"Canadian Chinese cuisine\" is widespread across the country, with great variation from place to place. Examples of such variation are seen in unique regional dishes, including Calgary ginger beef, Montreal peanut-butter dumplings, Newfoundland chow mein, and Thunder Bay bon bons.\nThe \"Chinese buffet\", although found in other parts of North America, traces its origins to early Gastown, Vancouver, c. 1870. This meal format developed from the practice of Chinese restaurateurs providing a steam table on a sideboard to serve Scandinavian lumberjacks working in local forests and mills.\nJapanese-Canadians have had a profound influence on the cuisines of British Columbia and Ontario. Distinct varieties of sushi, such as the B.C. roll and the California roll, originate from the Metro Vancouver region, while sushi pizza was invented in Toronto. Japadog street food in Vancouver is also a popular example of Canadian west coast fusion cuisine.\n\n### South Asian\nIndian and South Asian culinary influences are a relatively recent addition to Canadian cuisine, having gained wider prominence in the country during the post-1960's era of immigration, despite earlier South Asian settlement in British Columbia dating back to the late 19th century. Indian food is particularly popular in Canada, deriving mostly from Northern Indian cuisine. It is characterized for its use of bread, curry, and use of yogurt and cream for meat-based dishes; it also draws inspiration from South Indian cuisine in its use of sour and spicy combinations.\nUnique Indo-Canadian food includes the East Indian roti wrap, which gained popularity in Toronto during the 1980s and 1990s; using North Indian/Pakistani bread and curries as stuffing, local chefs originally drew inspiration from the West Indian roti which had entered the city's food scene in the 1960s and 1970s after a wave of Caribbean immigration. Also known as butter chicken roti, the dish is served at many Indian restaurants and fast food locations across Southern Ontario.\nOther Canadian food unique to the South Asian community includes \"Indian-style pizza\" (also known as \"Punjabi-style pizza\" or \"Desi-style pizza\") which has gradually gained popularity since originating in Greater Vancouver during the 1980s. Indian-style pizza has since expanded outside of Greater Vancouver, across other urban centres in western and central Canada with large South Asian populations, including Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Greater Toronto, later expanding to other regions. This type of pizza typically includes sauce with mixed spices and toppings such as cilantro, ginger, spinach, cauliflower, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, or paneer.\n\n### Southeast Asian\nContributions from Southeast Asia to Canadian cuisine includes a style of medium-thick crust pizza Margherita in Toronto. An example of fusion cuisine, the pizza is topped with garlic and basil oil topping, combining an Italian pizza with the Vietnamese tradition of using herbed oil toppings in food.\n\n## Regional ingredients\nWhile numerous and varied ingredients are commonly found throughout Canada, each region, with its tradition of culinary development, utilizes locally derived ingredients, both wild and agricultural, which are used to define unique dishes. The table below is meant to provide particular examples of regional staples and their key local ingredient.\n\n \n\nWild game of all sorts is still hunted and eaten by many Canadians, though not commonly in urban centres. Venison, from white-tailed deer, moose, elk (wapiti) or caribou, is eaten across the country and is considered quite important to many First Nations cultures. Seal meat is eaten, particularly in the Canadian North, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Wild fowl like ducks and geese, grouse (commonly called partridge) and ptarmigan are also regularly hunted. Other animals like bear and beaver may be eaten by dedicated hunters or indigenous people, but are not generally consumed by much of the population.\nSeafood is a very common constituent of Canadian cuisine broadly, but particularly in British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces. West Coast salmon varieties include sockeye, coho, chinook (also known as king), chum (also known as dog salmon), and pink, while salmon used on the East Coast can be broadly defined as Atlantic salmon. Freshwater fish, such as the walleye (also known as pickerel) and lake whitefish are commercially fished in the Great Lakes and are popular in southern Ontario. Both wild-caught and farmed rainbow trout are consumed throughout Canada.\nAlthough the majority of Canada's fish yield is captured wild, about 28% of the country's yield came from aquaculture in 2018. British Columbia accounts for 49% of the country's total aquaculture production volume, while the Maritime provinces account for 46%. Canada is the world's fourth-largest producer of farmed salmon, and other species, such as trout, Arctic char, mussels, oysters, and clams are well established industries.\nForage in Canadian cooking can include a variety of berries, mushrooms, Canada rice and herbs. Wild chanterelle, pine, morel, lobster, puffball, and other mushrooms are commonly consumed. Gooseberries, salmonberries, cranberries, strawberries, Saskatoon berries, cloudberries, soapberries, blackberries, blueberries, bilberries, currants, and huckleberries are gathered wild or grown.\nAlberta is renowned for its production of beef; in 2016, Alberta's cattle herd accounted for 41.6% of the national total. Alberta beef is thought to have a rich marbled flavour due to the province's nutritious grasslands and barley. Examples of local recipes that utilize Alberta beef include beef tartare, bistecca, roast beef, Sunday roast, short ribs, ginger-fried beef, and grilled steak. Canada ranks among the world's top 10 per capita consumers of beef.\nSaskatchewan is often referred to as the \"breadbasket of Canada\"; it accounts for nearly 50% of Canada's total crop yield and for two-fifths of the country's total field acreage. In 2016, canola and spring wheat were the two largest crops, Saskatoon berries accounted for over half of the \"fruit, berry and nut area\", and sweet corn was the largest field vegetable crop by area. Saskatchewan also produces most of the country's spice yield, particularly mustard, but also caraway and coriander.\n\n## Canadian foods\n\n\n### Main dishes, side dishes and appetizers\nAlthough there are considerable overlaps between Canadian culinary practices and those of the British Isles, France and the rest of North America, many dishes (or variations of imported dishes) are particular to, quintessential of, or available only in Canada.\n\n### Pastries and desserts\nMany pastries and desserts originate from Canada. Over 2100 bakery product manufacturing establishments, and more than 1200 retail bakeries, operate in the country. Tim Hortons, a Canadian restaurant chain that specialized in baked goods, maintains the highest number of franchises in the country.\n\nApple fritter—deep fried pastry rolled with apple and cinnamon, broken into pieces and then reformed into a single mass, then glazed with icing.\nBeaver tails—also known as elephant ears, moose antlers, dog ears, whale tails, or simply fried dough.\nBlueberry grunt—sweetened and stewed blueberries topped with a biscuit or dumpling.\nBrownie dominoes with wild blueberry cinnamon sauce—British Columbia regional delicacy; chocolate brownies topped with sauce made of wild B.C. blueberries and heated cinnamon.\nButter tarts—said to be invented in Eastern Ontario around 1915. The main ingredients for the filling include butter, sugar and eggs, but raisins and pecans are often added for additional flavour.\nCanadian maple doughnut—similar to a Boston cream doughnut; a custard-filled, solid pastry with a maple icing.\nCinnamon buns—Canadian variation of the cinnamon roll. One British Columbia variation includes apple and cranberry.\nDate square (also called \"Date crumblies\" or \"Matrimonial cake\")—date-filled desserts with an oatmeal crumb topping.\nDutchie—a square, yeast-lifted doughnut containing raisins and coated with a sugary glaze.\nGirl Guide Cookies—chocolate and vanilla cream-filled cookies, as well as chocolate mint. Traditionally sold by the Girl Guides of Canada since 1927.\nGlazed maple shortbread cookies—typically served during Canada Day celebrations.\nGrands-pères—dough dumplings boiled in maple syrup.\nJam busters—prairie jelly doughnuts\nJam Jams—molasses cookie sandwiches filled with jam.\nLassy Mogs—Newfoundland cookies made with molasses, spices, dried fruits, and toasted pecans.\nMaple leaf cream cookies—\"sandwich cookie\" containing maple-flavoured cream.\nMoosehunters—molasses cookies.\nNanaimo bars—consists of three layers: a wafer, nut (walnuts, almonds, or pecans), and coconut crumb base; custard icing in the middle; and a layer of chocolate ganache on top. Most common in British Columbia, gaining its name sake from the Vancouver Island town of Nanaimo, BC.\nNanaimo balls—a bite-sized variation of the British Columbian classic. Considered a Christmas treat.\nPassion flakes—pastry sandwich filled with raspberries or apple jam, and vanilla icing or whipped cream.\nPersians—somewhat like a cross between a large cinnamon bun and a doughnut, topped with strawberry icing; particular to Thunder Bay.\nPets de sœurs—\"nun farts\", pastry dough wrapped around a brown sugar and butter filling.\nPinecone gingerbread cookies—pinecone-shaped gingerbread cookies.\nPouding chômeur—\"poor man's pudding\".\nQueen Elizabeth cake—a lightly sweet, moist, and low-fat date (fruit) cake, topped with a brown sugar, butter and coconut broiled topping.\nSchmoo torte—a torte with layered whipped cream, caramel, and nuts, commonly made using angel food or sponge cake.\nSweet bannock—a piece of bannock sweetened with cinnamon and sugar, or made into bread pudding with berries.\nTea biscuit—similar to the North American biscuit or scone; quickbread typically made with cheese and herbs.\nTimbits—fried dough balls, provided in a variety of flavours and toppings.\n\n### Cheese\nDairy products became prominent among Central Canadian producers in the 1860s. Ontario's first cheese factory opened in 1863, and by the end of the decade, they had expanded to over two-hundred. The 1860s also saw to the start of a shift from wheat production to dairy and livestock in Quebec, which would become the dominant agricultural sector in the province by the early 20th century. Cream and cheese factory production would begin to increase exponentially in both Central and Eastern Canada by the 1880s.\nCanada is currently the 12th largest producer of cheese by tonnage, and is considered to be one of the major cheese-producing countries. Canadian cheese is mostly \"firm\", with cheddar and mozzarella being the most produced varieties in 2020. Among Canadians, specialty cheese (such as cream cheese, cottage cheese, and parmesan) is the most popular type, with cheddar being the second-most.\n\n### Commercially prepared food, condiments and beverages\nBaby food\nLove Child Organics\nPablum\nPure Organic Baby Food\nMother Hen\nBread\nBrands (bakeries): Ben's, Bon Matin, Dempster's, POM, Stonemill, Villaggio\nCanadian white bread, simply referred to as \"white bread\" in Canada, is distinct from its international counterparts due to the high protein content of Canadian wheat, as required by the Canadian Grain Commission, which gives it a heartier consistency.\nCandy/sweets \nChocolate bars: Coffee Crisp, Mr. Big, Caramilk, Big Turk, Cherry Blossom, Crunchie, Crispy Crunch, Aero, Pal-o-mine, Oh Henry!, Eat-more Chocolate bar\nChocolate candy: Bridge mixture, Smarties, Glosette pieces (peanut, raisin, or almonds)\nToffee: Templeman's Toffees, Two Brothers Toffee, Canadian Mackintosh's Toffee\nCereal \nAnita's Organic Mill\nDaybreak Mill\nFieldstone Organics\nHoly Crap\nMadeGood Foods\nRed River Cereal\nShreddies\nSunny Crunch\nVector\nCoffee—Canada is the 10th-highest coffee consumer, per capita, in the world. \nBrands: 49th Parallel Coffee Roasters, Kicking Horse, Nabob Coffee, Second Cup, Tim Hortons, Van Houtte, among numerous smaller brands.\nCanadian coffee—a blend of coffee, rye whisky, and maple syrup, often with whipped cream.\nCoffeehouses and doughnut shops\nBaker's Dozen Donuts\nCoffee Time\nCountry Style\nRobin's Donuts\nSecond Cup\nTim Hortons\nCondiments\nChow-chow\nCretons\nHoney dill sauce\nHoney garlic sauce\nMaple butter\nMaple syrup\nMontreal steak seasoning\nPeanut butter—Marcellus Gilmore Edson was the first to invent the manufactured product in 1884\nWindsor Salt\nFast food  \nA&W (Canada)\nBurger Baron\nEdo Japan\nExtreme Pita\nHarvey's\nManchu Wok\nMr. Sub\nMucho Burrito\nPita Pit\nTaco Time\nThai Express\nTriple-O's\nIce cream\nChapman's\nCows ice cream\nDickie Dee\nKawartha Dairy Company\nLaura Secord\nNeilson Dairy\nSwensen's\nMiscellaneous distributors and brands\nAgropur dairy brands, including Natrel\nKraft Dinner (also a proprietary eponym)\nLactalis Canada dairy brands, including Black Diamond and Cracker Barrel\nMaple Leaf Foods meat products\nNature's Path organic food products, including breakfast cereal, granola, and oatmeal\n\"No Name\" food brand\nOverwaitea Food Group brands, including Western Family\nPresident's Choice food brand\nSaputo Inc. dairy brands, including Dairyland Canada\nTim Hortons non-coffee products, such as \"timbit\" cereal, tea, soup, and granola bars\nNon-alcoholic drinks \nBagged milk\nBrio chinotto\nCanadian tea—various tea varieties grown and developed in the Chemainus River valley\nDavidsTea\nGinger ale (Canada Dry and Sussex Golden)\nIced Capp\nLabrador (or Hudson's Bay) tea\nLondon Fog\nRed Rose Tea\nSpruce beer—bière d'épinette, non-alcoholic soft drink from Quebec\nPizzerias\n241 Pizza\nBoston Pizza\nFreshslice Pizza\nGabriel Pizza\nGreco Pizza Restaurant\nKing of Donair\nMikes\nMother's Pizza\nPanago\nPizza 73\nPizza Delight\nPizza Nova\nPizza Pizza\nPizzaiolo\nTopper's Pizza\nSnacks \nDare Foods snack foods, such as Whippets and Wagon Wheels\nHawkins Cheezies\nHostess Potato Chips\nKetchup, salt and vinegar, dill pickle, and \"all dressed\" flavoured potato chips\nMiss Vickie's kettle-cooked chips\nNuts and Bolts aka Chex Mix\nPizza Pops\nRingolos and Humpty Dumpty Party Mix\nVachon Bakery snack pastries, such as Jos Louis and May West cakes\n\n## Alcohol\nCanada is considered one of the top whisky-producing countries, and is most renowned for rye whisky. Regulation states that Canadian whisky must age for a minimum of three years and be kept in oak barrels.  Canada houses about thirty whisky distilleries across the country, and produces 54.2 million liters. Canadian whisky is noted for its light and smooth style, and though most of it is blended, single-malt and 100% rye are some of the country's most desired. The Glenora Inn & Distillery is the only single-malt distillery in North America. \n\nCanada's wine industry is over two-hundred years old and includes the wine regions of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Canada's first commercial vineyard, the Pelee Island Winery, was established in 1866. There are currently over eight-hundred licensed wineries in the country, with the most recognized wine-producing areas being southern Ontario (most notably the Niagara peninsula), and the Okanagan valley of British Columbia.\n\n### Straight\nAcerum\nAlcohol Global 94%\nCanadian beer\nBrands (breweries): Alexander Keith's, Stanley Park Brewing, Kokanee beer, Labatt, Molson Canadian, Moosehead Breweries, Sleeman Breweries, among others.\nCream Ale\nIce beer\nCanadian whisky, commonly referred to as \"rye\".\nAlberta Premium\nBlack Velvet\nCanadian Club\nCrown Royal\nForty Creek\nGlen Breton\nGooderham and Worts\nJ.P.

Montreal food trucks offer shish taouk, the Montreal hot dog, and dollar falafels.  Although falafel is available in Vancouver, East Asian-influenced offerings are much more widespread, including sushi, samosas, Vietnamese banh mi or pho, Filipino offerings, and various Japanese and Chinese cuisines. In Victoria, British Columbia, vegan and vegetarian burgers are common, as are various seafood take-aways and Mexican-influenced street food. Since 2007, Toronto has encouraged vendors to sell street food from a wider variety of cuisines.\nIn Western Canada, a version of the Ukrainian garlic-pork sausage, referred to as \"kubasa\" (a corruption of the Ukrainian sausage \"kobasa\") is widely available. The term \"smokies\" or \"smokeys\" may refer to kubasa rather than frankfurters.\nFusion cultural foods are constantly evolving, such as the Japadog, which tops a hot dog with traditional Japanese ingredients, such as wasabi, teriyaki, shredded daikon radish, or bonito (fish) flakes. Pizza slices are a common street offering. Shawarma is quite prevalent in Ottawa and Windsor, while Halifax offers its own unique version of the döner kebab called the donair, which features a distinctive sauce made from condensed milk, sugar, garlic and vinegar. Ice cream trucks can be seen (and often heard due to a jingle being broadcast on loudspeakers) nationwide during the summer months. Winnipeg has a  line-up of food truck vendors on Main Street.\nLebanese Canadian fast-food restaurants such as Boustan offer their own unique version of poutine called the shawarma poutine, which features shawarma meat on top.\n\n### Street food markets\nVarious street food markets exist across the country. Metro Vancouver offers the \"Richmond Night Market\", with over 200 retail stalls offering predominantly East Asian-inspired food, such as grilled octopus, takoyaki, dumplings, fish sticks, and taiyaki. As well, there is the Shipyards Night Market in North Vancouver, which is more varied in its offerings and provides more than 35 food trucks per week over the course of its annual run.\nIn Alberta, notable street food markets include the Calgary Night Market, as well as the Calgary Stampede Night Market and Edmonton's What the Truck?. The Greater Toronto area runs Market 707, Adelaide Eats, and Night It Up!. Market 707 on Dundas Street is of particular aesthetic note given that it is formed out of refurbished shipping containers. Eastern Canada also maintains several street food markets of note, including Montreal's First Fridays and Halifax's Trusk-Side.\n\n## National food of Canada\nThough finding consensus among Canadians in determining a national food or dish can prove difficult, there are nonetheless several items broadly recognized as being representative of Canada's national cuisine. Foods typically considered national dishes of Canada include poutine and butter tarts. Canadian back or peameal bacon, as well as Atlantic or Pacific salmon, are also commonly thought of as representative of Canada.\nPublished by the Statista Research Department, a June 2015 poll asked Canadians, \"If Canada were to identify one of the following as official national food, which should it be?\" The results revealed Canadian bacon to be the top choice, followed by poutine:\n\nCanadian bacon (35%)\nPoutine (30%)\nAtlantic or Pacific salmon (17%)\nBeavertail (8%)\nTourtiere (6%)\nDoughnut (4%)\nCanCulture Magazine conducted a 2021 social media poll that sampled from fifty-five Canadians given ten choices. The poll revealed the following results:\n\nPoutine (38.9%)\nMaple syrup (25.9%)\nBeaverTails (9.3%)\nPeameal bacon and Timbits (7.4% each)\nAccording to an informal survey by The Globe and Mail conducted through Facebook from collected comments, users considered the following to be the Canadian national dish, with maple syrup likely above all the other foods if it were considered:\n\nPoutine (51%)\nMontreal-style bagels (14%)\nSalmon jerky (dried smoked salmon) (11%)\nPierogi/Perogy (10%)\nKetchup chips (7%)\nNova Scotian donair (4%)\nCalifornia roll (1%)\nCanada's most \"iconic\" foods were named in a survey conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in the summer of 2012, as:\n\nMaple syrup\nPoutine\nNanaimo bars, smoked salmon and butter tarts\nIn 2020, Hayley Simpson identified the \"best signature Canadian dishes\" as poutine, Nanaimo bars, butter tarts, beavertails, tourtière, pea soup, Halifax donair, Saskatoon berry pie, and Montreal-style bagels. The following year, Reader's Digest published an article similarly listing \"10 Must-Try Canadian Dishes\" as poutine, Canadian bacon, caesar, beavertails, Canadian pizza, butter tarts, Nanaimo bars, split pea soup, tourtière, and \"ketchup...on everything\".\n\n## Meal formats\nAs in other countries, Canadian meals are commonly segmented accordingly to their suitability for the time of day.\nBreakfast takes place in the morning and typically consists of a variety of foods, such as toast, biscuits, muffins, scones, pancakes, bacon, bagels, cereals, fruit and eggs, among others. Breakfast condiments are very common and can often include an assortment of jam, cream cheese, peanut butter, marmalade, or Nutella. Typical drinks include water, juice, coffee, and tea. Breakfast traditionally occurs before work or school on weekdays, or otherwise soon after waking up in the morning. An archetypal French-Canadian meal may contain more starch-based material, while an English-Canadian meal might consist of more protein.\n\nLumberjack's breakfast, also known as logger's breakfast or \"the lumby\"—a gargantuan breakfast of three-plus eggs, rations of ham, bacon and sausages, and several large pancakes.  This was invented by hotelier J. Houston c. 1870, at his Granville Hotel on Water Street in old pre-railway Gastown, Vancouver, in response to requests from his clientele for a better \"feed\" at the start of a long day of work.\nCoffee customarily refers to a small meal during a break from labour. This involves the consumption of a snack that, although it is the typical drink of choice (hence the name), may or may not include coffee. The Canada Labour Code requires employers to provide 30-minute breaks for every five consecutive hours of work.\nLunch generally takes place around noon. Sandwiches, soups, fruit, nuts, cheese and a variety of snacks are common foods during this meal. Lunches are usually compact, utilitarian, and/or casual, particularly given that they are often eaten at work, school, or otherwise outside of the home.\nDinner usually takes place from anywhere between 17:00 to 19:00, and tend to be heartier affairs based around protein and vegetables. Local flora and fauna are most fully realized during dinner; in the Maritimes, dinner may be more likely to include fish, while the Prairies might include more beef.\n\nSunday dinner in Canada is commonly observed as a more formal affair than typical dinners, often involving family and/or guests, and a more thoroughly prepared meal. Roast beef is a common centerpiece, but particular specialties also vary by region, such as traditional Prairie pot roast and Newfoundland Jiggs dinner.\n\n### Occasions\nChinese buffet or smorgasbord is a particular meal system invented in Gastown, Vancouver and prevalent throughout the country. This style of buffet was developed in the 19th century by Chinese immigrants in order to cater to the local clientele of Scandinavian Canadian loggers. Staples of Chinese-Canadian cuisine, as well as North American Chinese cuisine broadly, such as ginger beef, chow mein, and dumplings, are commonly available.\nChristmas dinner in Canada draws from the traditions of both Britain and France. These dinners are typically meant to serve a larger group than is usual, with the pièce de résistance often being turkey, roast beef, and/or ham. Sides often include stuffing, mashed or roast potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and cooked vegetables (such as carrots or yams). Pies and cakes are common desserts. Treats during the Christmas season typically include tarts, shortbread and gingerbread, bar, square, and \"snowball\" pastries, toffee, roll kuchen (particularly in the Prairies), crème brûlée, and biscotti. Easter weekend (April), Victoria Day weekend (May), and Canadian Thanksgiving (October) tend to share certain culinary customs with Christmas, albeit with different ingredients based on seasonality.\nPancake breakfast is a traditional public meal, particularly in Western Canada, which takes place during festivals, celebrations, and community events. This tradition has roots in the Prairies' ranching culture, as well as the Christian tradition of Shrove Tuesday. Such events that take part in a pancake breakfast include the Calgary Stampede, Grey Cup festival, and K-Days.\nPotlatch is a gift-giving feast practiced by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Although the occasion as a whole incorporates complex political, social, and economic elements, feasting is still a central aspect of the practice.\nRéveillon is a long dinner held in the evenings preceding Christmas Day and New Year's Eve, and is a traditional practice for French-Canadians across the country. Meals tend to be particularly opulent, and may include lobster, oysters, escargot, foie gras, and tourtière.

Below is a selection of various livestock breeds and cultivars that originate from Canada.\nApples\n\nDue to an influx of grain from the Prairies into British Columbia during the late 19th century, via the advent of the Canadian rail network, the province's grain production became largely redundant. This allowed for the development of specialized produce industries, such as fruit in the Okanagan. As a result, many of Canada's unique apple varieties have been developed in the interior of British Columbia.\n\nAmbrosia\nAurora Golden Gala\nBattleford\nCreston\nGolden Nugget\nJubilee\nMcIntosh\nMelba\nNicola\nNova Easygro\nSpartan\nWijcik McIntosh\nBeans\n\nCDC Blackstrap\nCDC Floral\nCDC Ray\nCDC Sol\nCDC Sunburst\nCDC Whitetrack\nCDC WM-2\nCDC WM-3\nMajesty\nWolfe\nCattle\n\nCanadienne\nHays Converter\nLynch Lineback\nSpeckle Park\nCherries\n\nLapins cherry\nSaskatoon Prairie cherry\nSkeena cherry\nStella cherry\nSweetheart cherry\nVan cherry\nPigs\n\nLacombe\nMiniature, or \"Teacup\"\nPotatoes\n\nThere are over sixty potato varieties that originate from Canada.

    "text": "# Caribbean cuisine\n\nCaribbean cuisine is a fusion of West African, Creole, Amerindian, European, Latin American, Indian/South Asian, Chinese, Javanese/Indonesian, North American, and Middle Eastern cuisines. These traditions were brought from many countries when they moved to the Caribbean.\n\n## History\nAs a result of the colonization, the Caribbean is a fusion of multiple sources; British, Spanish, Dutch and French colonized the area and brought their respective cuisines that mixed with West African as well as Amerindian, Indian/South Asian, East Asian, Portuguese, and Arab, influences from enslaved, indentured and other laborers brought to work on the plantations.\nIn 1493, during the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Spaniards introduced a variety of ingredients, including coconut, chickpeas, cilantro, eggplants, onions and garlic.\n\n## Caribbean dishes\nIngredients that are common in most islands' dishes are rice, plantains, beans, cassava, cilantro, bell peppers, chickpeas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, coconut, and any of various meats that are locally available like beef, poultry, pork, goat or fish. A characteristic seasoning for the region is a green herb-and-oil-based marinade called sofrito. Ingredients may include garlic, onions, Scotch bonnet peppers, celery, green onions, and herbs like cilantro, Mexican mint, chives, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. This green seasoning is used for a variety of dishes like curries, stews and roasted meats.\nTraditional dishes are so important to regional culture that, for example, the local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of Montserrat and is also one of the signature dishes of St. Kitts and Nevis. Another popular dish in the Anglophone Caribbean is called \"cook-up\", or pelau. Ackee and saltfish is another popular dish that is unique to Jamaica. Callaloo is a dish containing leafy vegetables such as spinach and sometimes okra amongst others, widely distributed in the Caribbean, with a distinctively mixed African and indigenous character.\nThe variety of dessert dishes in the area also reflects the mixed origins of the recipes. In some areas, black cake, a derivative of English Christmas pudding, may be served, especially on special occasions.\n\n## By location\n\n\n## See also\n\nGround provisions\nList of cuisines\nCaribbean Chinese cuisine\nPuerto Rican Chinese cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Central Asian cuisine\n\nCentral Asian cuisine has been influenced by Persian, Indian, Arab, Turkish, Chinese, Mongol, and Russian cultures, as well as the culinary traditions of other varied nomadic and sedentary civilizations. Contributing to the culinary diversity were the migrations of Uyghur, Slav, Korean, Tatar, Dungan and German people to the region.\n\n## Background\nNomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppe had simple subsistence diets based primarily on dairy products, and to a lesser extent game and plant-based foods. Excavations at Adji Kui in the Karakum Desert of Turkmenistan have shown the site was occupied between 2400 and 1300 BC. Archaeobotanical evidence has shown that crop diffusion was ongoing across the mountain valleys and oasis towns of Central Asia as early as the 3rd millennium BC. The earliest evidence of domesticated grains bring used by nomadic herders (2800 to 2300 BC) has been found at the Tasbas and Begash sites of the Kazakh highland steppe. Triticum turgidum and panicum miliaceum found at highland campsites in Central Eurasia represent the first known transmission of these domesticated grains from China and the region south of the Syr Darya river into Central Eurasia.\nCentral Asian cooking techniques were influenced by the lack of water. Poplar trees, saxaul and animal dung were the primary fuel sources used in tandyr ovens, designed to maximize the heat gained from the limited supply of fuel, where flatbread, samsa and meats were cooked. Soups, stews and steamed dumplings were cooked in single cauldron pots. \n\nPersian cuisine in the golden age of Iran was highly sophisticated with ingredients from China and the Mediterranean. Turkic influence was seen in manti dumplings, wheat porridge called sumalak and assorted dairy products. Mahmud al-Kashgari describes pit cooking, baking in earthenware and grilling. Even after the disruption of the 13th century Mongol invasions, Iranian and Turkic culinary traditions carried on in Ottoman palace cuisine and have survived into the 20th century.\nTimur's empire is considered the last significant Central Asian Empire of the 14th century, covering the territories of modern-day Baghdad, the Volga and Delhi. The Mughal Empire, founded by Babur, a descendant of Timur, was noted for cultural achievements, among this a sophisticated cuisine that blended Indian and Persian elements into a unique style. Fragrant spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and mace were used to flavor dishes, that were served with thick sauces made from yogurt and crushed nuts. The rice pilafs were sophisticated. Desserts were flavored with rose. Modern Indian cuisine is heavily influenced by Mughal cuisine, including the grilled tandoori meats and yogurt sauces.\n\n## Characteristics\nThe culinary cultures of Central Asia may be divided as follows: nomadic or urban; highland or lowland; and Mongol, Turkic or Iranian. The nomadic diet based on meat and dairy products is found in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. While lamb and beef, breads, baked pies and homemade noodles are common across the region, besh barmak (a lamb dish eaten with the hands) and horse meat are found only in some regions, mostly Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe typical dishes of the settled Turkic peoples—Uzbek and Uighurs—are pilafs, kebabs, stews, noodles, tandyr flatbreads and savory pastries. The Iranian cultural influence is seen in the cuisine of Tajikistan and southern Uzbekistan, reaching into northern Pakistan and India, where rice and stewed vegetable dishes are more elaborately spiced.\nSome common ingredients and flavors can be found in the varied cuisines of region. These include generous use of tail fat from sheep and onion, hot peppers, black pepper, cumin, sesame seed, nigella, basil, cilantro, parsley, mint and dill. These are used in all sorts of dishes including soups, salads and pilafs. Less common are cinnamon and saffron. \nTea is the most popular beverage. Green tea with cream is more common in Kyrgyz cuisine, while black tea is more common in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. A chaikhana is a Central Asian teahouse where people gather to socialize over tea. Traditional dishes are served like shorpo (soup), shashlik (grilled meats), mastoba, manty, pilov and samsa.\nKumis is a traditional drink of the Turkic peoples of Central Asia. It is a fermented dairy product traditionally made from mare's milk or donkey milk.\nA meal typically begins with tea or fresh tandyr nan bread, followed by soup (shorpo) or pulled noodles (lagman). The main course is often a pilov dish with meat, rice and carrots; hundreds of variations of the basic pilov are possible with the addition of different herbs, dried fruits like raisins and apricots, nuts and other ingredients. After the main course a guest may be offered dumplings or grilled skewers of meat, and fresh fruit often takes the place of a final dessert course. In many parts of Central Asia the meal is served on the floor with many plates laid out on a dastarkhan cloth.\nKorean cuisine has also influenced Central Asian cuisine, through Koryo-saram cuisine. Koryo-saram, ethnic Koreans of the former Soviet Union, have introduced dishes such as morkovcha that have become significantly popular throughout the former Soviet Union.\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Desserts\nHalva is made from sesame seeds, with flour, sugar, milk and nuts. Fruit compote with nuts is a typical dessert dish. There are hundreds of melon varieties grown locally in Central Asia, and plums, apples, apricots, pears, berries and cherries are locally available. In addition to these pomegranates, fig, peaches and persimmons are imported.\nThe local version of baklava is called paklama. For Eid celebrations, deep-fried dough balls drenched in honey syrup called çäkçäk are piled into mounds, along with sugar-dusted dough spirals called urama. Kyrgyz boortsog is a similar deep-fried dough dish, called bogursak in Turkmenistan, and baursaq in Kazakhstan.\nNot traditional to the regional cuisine, European-style layered cakes and pastries are available in modern times. Nuts, honey, fruits and halva remain common traditional choices.\n\n### Fruits\nThe region's melons are renowned, and cherries, apples, plums, peaches and figs are also locally grown. Fruit is consumed as a snack, fresh or dried, at all times of day.\n\n### Grains\nThe main grain crops of Central Asia are millet, rice, wheat and barley. Rice and wheat are used to make the staple dishes of flatbread and noodles. Wheat flour is used to make traditional flatbread called tandyr nan, dumplings called manti, smaller dumplings called chuchvara and stuffed pastries called samsa. \nMillet is the main ingredient of the beverage boza. Similar in flavor to beer, boza is made in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\nRice pilaf is the most iconic Central Asian dish, with Uzbek cuisine offering a multitude of varieties, often mixed with legumes for added protein.\nFrom Turkic cuisine came the flatbreads yufka and çörek, qatlama pastry and a noodle dish called tutmaç. Beliashi are open-faced pies cooked in a skillet.\n\n### Vegetables\nThe most common vegetables are turnips, tomatoes, radishes, onions, peas, red peppers and cucumbers. Turp is the local name for a large green radish that is usually eaten fresh as a side dish or salad. \"Yellow carrot\" (sabzi turisida) is actually a type of parsnip that is used in pilaf dishes. Squash are a common ingredient for stews, soups, dumplings, and samsa.\nBoth written history and molecular genetic studies indicate that the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan).\n\n## See also\nList of Asian cuisines\nBukharan Jewish cuisine\nKazakh cuisine\nKoryo-saram cuisine\nKyrgyz cuisine\nSoviet cuisine\nTajik cuisine\nTurkmen cuisine\nUzbek cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

It is grown without using agrochemicals. It is used for ceremonial purposes and special occasions during making of Chakhao kheer. It requires 40-45 minutes to cook due to the presence of the fibrous bran layer and higher crude fiber content.\n\n## Geographical indication\nIt was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) status tag from the Geographical Indications Registry, under the Union Government of India, on 20 April 2020 and is valid until 25 December 2027.\nConsortium of Producers of Chak-Hao (Black Rice) from Imphal, proposed the GI registration of Chak-Hao. After filing the application in December 2017, the rice was granted the GI tag in 2020 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai, making the name \"Chak-Hao\" exclusive to the rice grown in the region. It thus became the first rice variety from Manipur and Nagaland. It also is the 5th type of goods from Manipur and 4th from Nagaland to earn the GI tag respectively.\nThe GI tag protects the rice from illegal selling and marketing, and gives it legal protection and a unique identity.\n\n\n== References ==",

The 12th-century Sanskrit text Manasollasa documenting a recipe used to prepare what is today known as the chapli kebab.\n\n## Etymology\nThe name chapli may be derived from the Pashto word chaprikh/chapdikh/chapleet, meaning \"flat\" – alluding to the kebab's light, round and flattened texture. Alternatively, the name may be derived from chappal, the Indic word for sandals – relating the average shape and size of a kebab to that of a chappal sole.\n\n## Ingredients and preparation\nThe chapli kebab is prepared with raw, marinated mince and the meat can be either beef or lamb/mutton. The main ingredients include wheat flour, various herbs and spices such as chili powder, coriander leaves, followed by smaller quantities of onions, tomatoes, eggs, ginger, coriander or cumin seeds, green chillies, corn starch, salt and pepper, baking powder and citric juice, like that of lime or lemon.\nThe kebabs can be fried shallow or deep in vegetable cooking oil over medium heat. The traditional chapli kebab is prepared by frying the kebabs in lamb fat or cow fat over wood-fired stoves to lend an organic flavour. This approach is avoided by some gastronomists, citing health-conscious reasons.\n\n## Serving\nOnce cooked, chapli kebabs can be served and garnished with parsley, chopped onions and tomatoes, along with other accompaniments such as various chutney sauces, salad, yoghurt, pickles or nuts. The chapli kebab is best served aromatic, moist and spicy. It is considered a specialty of Pashtun cuisine and often served to guests. The kebab is commonly consumed in meals with bread such as naan, rice dishes such as Kabuli pulao, or wrapped in fast food. In winters, green tea such as kahwah may traditionally be served alongside it, while cold drinks are preferred in the summers.\n\n## See also\nList of kebabs\n\n## Notes\n \n\n\n== References ==",

The Chettiars, through their mercantile contacts with Burma, learnt to prepare a type of rice pudding made with sticky red rice. The chefs of Manapatti village near Singampunari are experts in cooking Chettinad cuisine.\n\n## Dishes\nChettinad cuisine offers a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Some of the popular vegetarian dishes include idiyappam, paniyaram, vellai paniyaram, karuppatti paniyaram, paal paniyaram, kuzhi paniyaram, kozhukatta, masala paniyaram, aadikoozh, kandharappam, seeyam, masala seeyam, kavuni arisi, maavurundai, and athirasam. The most common meats used in Chettinad cuisine are goat, chicken, mutton, and marine fish.\n\n## Spices\nIn Chettinad food, major spices used include anasipoo (star aniseed), kalpasi (a lichen), puli (tamarind), milagai (chillies), sombu (fennel seed), pattai (cinnamon), lavangam (cloves), punnai ilai (bay leaf), karu milagu (peppercorn), jeeragam (cumin seeds), and venthayam (fenugreek).\n\n## Historical influences\nChettinad cuisine is notable for its myriad of culinary influences from Southeast Asia, derived from the inhabitants of the region being greatly involved in the maritime trade throughout the Indian Ocean for centuries. Burmese cuisine in particular has a large influence on Chettinad fare, reflected in the usage of fermented and dried prawns and fish for flavor, as well as pickles and rice dishes inspired by Burmese cuisine, such as Burmese black rice or burma kavuni arisi, a heirloom rice cultivar used by residents of Chettinad to make idiyappam, pongal, sticky rice pudding, and other delicacies. Burmese noodle dishes and mohinga are also popular in the Chennai area; they were brought to the region by Myanmar Tamils of the Chettiar community who were deported en masse during the Burmese dictatorship of Ne Win.\n\nIn the 2014 book The Bangala Table: Flavor and Recipes from Chettinad by Sumeet Nair and Meenakshi Meyyappan,  historian S. Muthiah writes:The Chettiars have traditionally been vegetarians. Their feasts at lifestyle ritual functions remain vegetarian. But trade once had them criss-crossing the southern reaches of peninsular India and absorbing non-vegetarian influences from the Malabar Coast, where Christians of the Orthodoxy of West Asia and Muslims lived in large numbers and Hindus too tended to non-vegetarianism. Further non-vegetarian influences became entrenched in Chettiar food habits from the late 18th Century after they established businesses in Ceylon, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, French Indo-China and what is now Malaysia and Singapore. So did non-vegetarian fare from other parts of India through which they traveled en route to their overseas businesses.Writer Guy Trebay adds in the foreword of the same book:One is lucky to eat like a Chettiar, they say in South India. Chettiars say it themselves. They say it because a Chettiar table is a groaning board but also because the cuisine is uncommonly subtle and aromatic, a heritage of Chettiar participation in the centuries-old spice trade, the global import and export of pungent seeds and fruits and barks from places like Cochin and Penang, the Banda Islands, Arab ports in the Straits of Hormuz. To the coconut and rice and legumes that are staples of South Indian cooking they added Tellicherry pepper, Ceylon cardamom, Indonesian nutmeg, Madagascar cloves and blue ginger, or galangal, from Laos and Vietnam.In places like Penang, in what is now Malaysia, the Chettiars developed a liking for the sweet-sour piquancy of Straits Chinese cooking, [sic] In Saigon, they adapted their cuisine to absorb the herbs that perfume Vietnamese food. In Buddhist Ceylon, they relaxed their dietary prohibitions typical of orthodox Hindus and came to enjoy meat.Thus, the Chettinad region—a semi-arid zone comprising scores of villages, sleepy and agrarian, studded with important ancient temples yet far from major commercial centers—became an unlikely locus of internationalized tastes.\n\n## See also\n\nTamil cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just \"chicken\") and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.\nChicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, boiling, and roasting. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthy than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.\nThe poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth in 2011, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.\n\n## History\nThe modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.\nChicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most common meats available in the Middle Ages. For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern Hemisphere, including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.\nIn the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was \"sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish.\" Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).\n357 million tonnes of meat were produced in 2021, 53% more than in 2000, with chicken meat representing more than half the increase. Chicken meat was the most produced type of meat in 2021 just ahead of pig meat.\n\n## Breeding\nModern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.\nChickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds.\nCapons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.\n\n## Edible components\nMain\nBreast: These are white meat and are relatively dry. The breast has two segments which are sold together on bone-in breasts, but separated on boneless breasts:\nThe breast, when sold as boneless, and\ntwo tenderloins, located on each side between the breast meat and the ribs. These are removed from boneless breasts and sold separately as tenderloins.\nLeg: Comprises two segments:\nThe drumstick; this is dark meat and is the lower part of the leg,\nthe thigh; also dark meat, this is the upper part of the leg.\nWing: Often served as a light meal or bar food. Buffalo wings are a typical example. Comprises three segments:\nthe drumette, shaped like a small drumstick; this is white meat,\nthe middle flat (or wingette) segment, containing two bones, and\nthe tip, often discarded or used for stock\nOther\nChicken feet: These contain relatively little meat, and are eaten mainly for the skin and cartilage. Although considered exotic in Western cuisine, the feet are common fare in other cuisines, especially in the Caribbean, China and Vietnam.\nGiblets: organs such as the heart, gizzards, and liver may be included inside a butchered chicken or sold separately.\nHead: Considered a delicacy in China, the head is split down the middle, and the brain and other tissue is eaten.\nKidneys: Normally left in when a broiler carcass is processed, they are found in deep pockets on each side of the vertebral column.\nNeck: This is served in various Asian dishes. It is stuffed to make helzel among Ashkenazi Jews. 'Chicken Neck Tiniim' is an iconic dish of Nueva Ecija. It is a blend of black pepper, garlic powder, pineapple juice, soy sauce, chicken neck, cheese, butter, and minced garlic.\nOysters: Located on the back, near the thigh, these small, round pieces of dark meat are often considered to be a delicacy.\nPygostyle (chicken's buttocks) and testicles: These are commonly eaten in East Asia and some parts of South East Asia.\nBy-products\nBlood: Immediately after slaughter, blood may be drained into a receptacle, which is then used in various products. In many Asian countries, the blood is poured into low, cylindrical forms, and left to congeal into disc-like cakes for sale. These are commonly cut into cubes, and used in soup dishes.\nCarcass: After the removal of the flesh, this is used for soup stock.\nChicken eggs: The most well-known and well-consumed byproduct.\nHeart and gizzard: in Brazilian churrascos, chicken hearts are an often seen as a delicacy.\nLiver: This is the largest organ of the chicken, and is used in such dishes as pâté and chopped liver.\nSchmaltz: This is produced by rendering the fat, and is used in various dishes.\n\n## Health\nChicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.\nChicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. 100 grams (3.5 oz) of raw chicken breast contains 2 grams (0.071 oz) of fat and 22 grams (0.78 oz) of protein, compared to 9 grams (0.32 oz) of fat and 20 grams (0.71 oz) of protein for the same portion of raw beef flank steak.\n\n### Use of roxarsone in chicken production\nIn factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA. The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that \"any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern\".\nThe FDA approval for roxarsone and two other arsenic poultry drugs were voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturers in September 2013. The final remaining arsenic drug nitarsone was banned at the end of 2015.\n\n### Antibiotic resistance\nInformation obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) \"strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of the drug in poultry production\". According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs.\nA study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States. An estimated 90–100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%.\n\n### Fecal matter contamination\nIn random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms, the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material (e.g., sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.).\nDuring shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces.\nThere is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed. The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g., bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. The fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove.\n\n## Marketing and sales\nChicken is sold both as whole birds and broken down into pieces.\nIn the United Kingdom, juvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter are marketed as poussin. Mature chicken is sold as small, medium or large.\nIn the United States, whole mature chickens are marketed as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size (2.5-4 lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Broilers are larger than fryers. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3–5 months and 6–8 lbs) and are typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying, a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready.\nChicken is also sold broken down into pieces. Such pieces usually come from smaller birds that would qualify as fryers if sold whole. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless or skinless. Chicken livers and gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts.\n\nWorldwide, there are many fast food restaurant chains that sell exclusively or primarily poultry products including KFC (global), Red Rooster (Australia), Hector Chicken (Belgium) and CFC (Indonesia). Most of the products on the menus in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries.\n\n## Cooking\nRaw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites. However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw.\nChicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos. Eastern cuisine has chicken prepared by marination, especially chicken Philippine adobo.\nChickens often come with labels such as \"roaster\", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods.\nSome chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker \"with rib meat\". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, \"tenders\" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called \"chicken mini-fillets\".\nChicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock.\nIn Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either \"chicken frames\" or \"chicken carcasses\" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.\n\n## Freezing\nRaw chicken maintains its quality longer than fresh in the freezer, as moisture is lost during cooking. There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage. For optimal quality, however, a maximum storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for uncooked whole chicken, 9 months for uncooked chicken parts, 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets, and 4 months for cooked chicken. Freezing does not usually cause color changes in poultry, but the bones and the meat near them can become dark. This bone darkening results when pigment seeps through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed.\nIt is safe to freeze chicken directly in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended to overwrap these packages. It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is. If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, but it is still recommended to overwrap or rewrap it. Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices will not drip onto other foods. If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly.\nBacteria survives but does not grow in freezing temperatures. However, if frozen cooked foods are not defrosted properly and are not reheated to temperatures that kill bacteria, chances of getting a foodborne illness greatly increase.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nThis article incorporates text from a free content work.

    "text": "# Manchurian (dish)\n\nManchurian is a class of Indian Chinese dishes made by roughly chopping and deep-frying ingredients such as chicken, cauliflower (gobi), prawns, fish, mutton, and paneer, and then sautéeing them in a sauce flavored with soy sauce. While not a Chinese dish, it is the result of the adaptation of Chinese cooking and seasoning techniques specifically aimed to suit Indian tastes and has become a staple of Indian-Chinese cuisine.\n\n## History\nThe word Manchurian means native or inhabitant of Manchuria (in northeast China); the dish, however, is a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, and bears little resemblance to traditional Manchu cuisine or Northeastern Chinese cuisine. It is said to have been invented in 1975 by Nelson Wang, a cook at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, when a customer asked him to create a new dish, rather than what was on the menu.  Wang described the invention process as starting from the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilis, but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself. The dish is popular across South Asia. A popular vegetarian variant replaces chicken with cauliflower, and is commonly known as gobi manchurian.\n\n## Variations\nThere are two different variants of Manchurian: dry or semi-dry, and with gravy. Both variants are prepared by using common ingredients like corn flour, maida flour, spring onion, bell peppers, soy sauce, chili sauce, minced garlic, and ground pepper, and are typically garnished with spring onion. Some recipes call for use of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to increase the taste profile, though there are those who avoid it due to the common misconception that it causes headaches. Its taste can vary from mildly spicy to hot and fiery based on the recipe and personal preference.\n\n### Dry or crispy Manchurian\nThe fritters are served comparatively dry, often as a snack or starter with tomato ketchup as dipping sauce. It is popular among alcohol drinkers as a bar snack, and has been described as \"an excellent drinking companion to cold beer\".\n\n### Manchurian with gravy\nThe fritters are coated with a thick sauce like spicy gravy curry made of corn flour. It is generally served with varieties of rice dishes like steamed rice, Chinese fried rice, or Sichuan fried rice, as the main course.\n\n## See also\n\nChina–India relations\nChindians\nHistorical and cultural relations between China and India\nList of deep-fried foods\nList of vegetable dishes\nManchow soup\nManchu cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.\n\n## Regional variations\n\n\n### Indian subcontinent\nIndian cuisine has a large amount of regional variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through. In south India, coconut and curry leaves are also common ingredients. Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or roti.\nIn south India, chicken curry may be thickened using coconut milk.\n\n### Caribbean\nThis dish was introduced to the Indians by indentured Indian workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of India, consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces. However, poultry in Trinidad and Tobago was so readily available that the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. Typical preparation includes seasoning and marinating the chicken meat in a green seasoning consisting of culantro, coriander, French thyme, thyme, scallion, onion, garlic, and peppers. Then the curry is prepared by first adding oil to the pot and then adding and cooking curry powder mixed with water, then the chicken. When the chicken is fried, additional ingredients are added, and the dish is left to cook until finished. It is usually served with bread or beans. Curry chicken and its derivatives are also popular in Suriname, Guyana, Jamaica, Martinique, Saint Lucia and other Caribbean territories with Indo-Caribbean influence.\n\n### Southeast Asia\nIn Southeast Asia, where coconuts, and different spices originated, various native dishes made with coconut milk or curry pastes and eaten with rice are often collectively referred to as \"curries\" in English. Examples of these include Thai gaeng gai, Cambodian kari sach moan (Khmer: សាច់មាន់) and Filipino ginataang manok. Chicken curries feature prominently in the repertoire of Burmese curries and in Burmese ohn no khao swè, a noodle soup of coconut milk and curried chicken.\nHowever, derivatives of Indian chicken curry may be distinguished because they are relatively modern and are made with curry powder, curry tree leaves, or other Indian spices, like the Filipino chicken curry and the Malaysian chicken curry, although they still use ingredients native to Southeast Asia.\n\n### North America\nCountry captain chicken is a stewed chicken dish flavored with curry powder, popular in parts of the Southern United States. The Hobson-Jobson Dictionary states the following:\n\nCOUNTRY-CAPTAIN. This is in Bengal the name of a peculiar dry kind of curry, often served as a breakfast dish. We can only conjecture that it was a favourite dish at the table of the skippers of 'country ships,' who were themselves called 'country captains,' as in our first quotation. In Madras the term is applied to a spatchcock dressed with onions and curry stuff, which is probably the original form. [Riddell says: \"Country-captain.—Cut a fowl in pieces; shred an onion small and fry it brown in butter; sprinkle the fowl with fine salt and curry powder and fry it brown; then put it into a stewpan with a pint of soup; stew it slowly down to a half and serve it with rice\" (Ind. Dom. Econ. 176).]\n1792.—\"But now, Sir, a Country Captain is not to be known from an ordinary man, or a Christian, by any certain mark whatever.\" — Madras Courier, April 26.\n\nc. 1825.—\"The local name for their business was the 'Country Trade,' the ships were 'Country Ships,' and the masters of them 'Country Captains.' Some of my readers may recall a dish which was often placed before us when dining on board these vessels at Whampoa, viz. 'Country Captain.'\"—The Fankwae at Canton (1882), p. 33.\nIn 1940, Mrs. W.L. Bullard from Warm Springs, Georgia served this dish under the name \"Country Captain\" to Franklin D. Roosevelt and General George S. Patton.\n\n## See also\n\n\n== References ==",

The dish's relative, gosht karahi (gosht kadahi) is thought to have originated in the colonial era North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) with this dish being made of lamb or goat, rather than chicken.\nThe dish is a staple in menus of Indian and Pakistani restaurants in various parts of the world; the 'Bigger than Bollywood' experience at Hexham Library in Northumberland featured Indian cooks making chicken karahi with naan for British Film Institute tourists as early as 2002.\n\n## References\n\n\n### Notes\n\n\n=== Citations ===",

    "text": "# Chicken lollipop\n\nChicken lollipop is a popular Indian fried chicken appetiser. Chicken lollipop is essentially a frenched chicken winglet, wherein the meat is cut loose from the bone end and pushed down, creating a lollipop appearance.\n\n## Recipe\nRecipes vary at different restaurants. However, many start by using the middle segment of the chicken wing or thigh. The middle segment has one of the two bones removed, and the flesh on the segments is pushed to one end of the bone. These are then coated in a spicy red batter whose main ingredients include red chili powder, and turmeric. The coated chicken is then marinated for a couple of hours. The marinated chicken is usually deep fried in oil, but another choice is baking the chicken. The exposed bone is sometimes wrapped in aluminum foil.\n\n## See also\n\nList of hors d'oeuvre\nBuffalo wing\nSwiss wing\n\n\n== References ==",

Scholars and critics have debated the status of the dish, concluding variously that it has undergone an elaborate process of cultural interchange, and serves as symbol of Britain's multicultural society. Lizzie Collingham states that it feels quintessentially South Asian despite its British origins.\n\n## Composition\nChicken tikka masala is a brightly coloured curry composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices (masala) and yoghurt, roasted in an oven, and served in a creamy sauce. A tomato and coriander leaf sauce is common, but there is no standard recipe: a 1998 survey in Britain found that among 48 recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. It is served as a main course, often with rice or flatbread. Chicken tikka masala is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.\n\n## Origins\n\n\n### Mughal ancestry\nThe English word \"tikka\" is borrowed from Urdu/Hindi (تکہ)/टिक्का tikkā \"small pieces of meat\", itself a borrowing from Classical Persian تکه tikka, \"pieces\". Chicken tikka (without a sauce) was created in the reign of the Mughal Emperor Babur (r. 1526–1530) by marinating pieces of chicken meat in yoghurt and spices, and then grilling them in a tandoor oven.\n\n### Created in Glasgow\nIt has been suggested that chicken tikka masala originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland. This version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in Glasgow from the 1960s, invented the dish by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices, to please a customer who wanted a sauce to accompany the dry chicken tikka meat.\nThe historian of ethnic food Peter Grove challenges the claim that Aslam had created the dish, on the grounds that the dish existed several years before his restaurant opened. Specifically, Sultan Ahmed Ansari, owner of Glasgow's Taj Mahal restaurant, stated that he had created the dish in the 1950s.\nThe London restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using Campbell's tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala \"to entertain journalists\", and that in particular the use of the soup was \"completely made up\".\n\n### Invented in Britain\nMany sources attribute the creation of chicken tikka masala to the South Asian community in Great Britain. The British Indian businessman Gulam Noon is among the people who helped to popularise the dish, though he was not its inventor; he ran food product companies in Southall, in the west of London.\nIt has been suggested that the dish is derived from butter chicken, a popular dish in the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant chefs in Britain in the 1960s, who at that time ran most of Britain's Indian restaurants. They developed several new British Indian dishes.\nPeter and Colleen Grove conclude that the dish \"was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef.\" They suggest that \"the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh's Indian Cookery published in 1961.\" Mrs Balbir Singh's recipe calls for onions fried in oil, with garlic, ginger, masala spices and tomatoes for the frying mixture for the chicken; cream, ground almonds, and yoghurt are added later in the cooking.\n\n### Adapted from an Indian dish\nRahul Verma, a food critic for The Hindu, claimed that the dish has its origins in the Punjab region.\n\n## Impact\n\n\n### Popularity\nChicken tikka masala is served in restaurants around the world. By 2010, it was the most popular dish in British curry houses. According to a 2012 survey of 2,000 people in Britain, it was the country's second-most popular foreign dish to cook, after Chinese stir fry. The Oxford Companion to Food traces this popularity to 1983, when supermarkets began selling the dish as a chilled meal; and as of 2016 it was the third most popular ready meal sold in UK supermarkets. In 2025, the scholars of Indian food Bhaskar Sailesh and K. Karthikeyan called it \"the world's best-recognized dish\". In 2009, efforts by Scottish parliamentarian Mohammed Sarwar to gain the Glasgow dish protected designation of origin status were however unsuccessful.\nIn the United States, chicken tikka masala has in addition been sold as a taco filling by food trucks and as a pizza topping. In India, chicken tikka masala has been seen as a novelty dish in its own right, and alongside that it has been used as a pizza topping by an Indian fast food chain. BBC Good Food has proposed chicken tikka masala pizzas, using naan flatbreads topped with the curry mix, yoghurt, and mango chutney.\n\n### Symbol of a multicultural society\nIn 2001, the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook mentioned the dish in a speech acclaiming the benefits of Britain's multiculturalism, declaring:\n\nChicken tikka masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy.\nThe social scientists Binod Baral and Basanta Adhikari carried out a statistical survey of people's views of the role of chicken tikka masala in the UK; the participants lived in the UK and had eaten in British Indian restaurants. They write that the dish \"represents the fusion of British and Indian culinary traditions\", and \"serves as a symbol of multicultural society\". In their view, it has contributed to cultural exchange between the communities involved. \nThe scholar of human geography Peter Jackson describes the evolution of chicken tikka masala as an elaborate process of cultural assimilation and rejection. The process resulted in the \"indigenisation\" of the original dish, giving it a distinctively British quality. Jackson specifically rejects the charge of cultural appropriation, which he considers a simplistic view of the interchanges involved.\nCook's invocation of chicken tikka masala as a national dish and its description of the dish's origin as British have been widely debated. The speech has been criticised by Indian chefs and commentators as disrespectful to Indian cuisine, where in their view the dish is a \"cognate of curries originating in South Asia\" appropriated by \"White British colonialists\". Such characterizations have in turn been criticised as relying on notions that racial groups can own recipes. The social historian Panikos Panayi, noting the criticism of the speech, writes that Cook's central point, that immigration had influenced British food, was correct.\n\n### Authenticity\nThe scholar of modern history Elizabeth Buettner writes that \"popular dishes like chicken tikka masala were mocked as the antithesis of 'real' Indian food as often as they were celebrated as a 'British national dish'.\" Buettner noted that these attacks on British Indian restaurants came from both \"middle-class white Britons and better-off South Asians\".\nThe Indian chef Raghavan Iyer notes the shock of \"some food critics\" at Cook's speech, writing of chicken tikka masala that they \"deemed it 'inauthentic'\" because of the addition of a sauce in Britain. Iyer writes that \"the authentic version of the dish had no sauce\", pointing to the Mughal creation of chicken tikka, but comments that all the same the dish \"feels quintessentially Indian\" to many people, despite its British origins. With the sauce, however, in his opinion \"the dish took on a personality of its own in Britain\", going on to be adopted around the world. \nOther scholars, such as the anthropologist Sidney Mintz, deny that there is such a thing as a national cuisine, since habits of cooking and of eating do not respect national borders. Anupama Preetha and Anderleen Lazarus take chicken tikka masala as a prime exemplar of Mintz's statement; they note both that the dish was created across borders, and that its \"ingredients and procedures\" have been used to create numerous other dishes.\nThe historian of food Lizzie Collingham discusses the question of the authenticity of Indian food in Britain, with respect to chicken tikka masala. She gives as an example the journalist and film-maker Jonathan Meades, who wrote in The Times that far from being a pleasing instance of how multicultural the British were, it showed how they could turn anything into an inedible and unappetising mess. Further, Collingham cites the British Bangladeshi businessman Iqbal Wahhab and journalist Emma Brockes's view that the problem with chicken tikka masala is that it is inauthentic. Collingham writes that what Indians eat is highly variable, being a product of their caste, regional origin, religion, and wealth. From 1968, British Indian restaurants started to install Punjabi-style tandoor ovens, bringing the ability to prepare naan bread, and to roast meat on skewers and chicken tikka, paving the way for chicken tikka masala. \nThe scholar of culture Stephen Fielding describes chicken tikka masala as the most popular of the British Bangladeshi restaurant dishes. He writes that in response, more upmarket Indian restaurants have sought to be more authentic, claiming to serve what Namita Panjabi, the owner of London's Chutney Mary restaurant, calls \"individual, original recipes, not those that have been adulterated or standardised.\" In the same vein, Fielding quotes Gordon Ramsay's praise for another London restaurant, Tamarind, distinguishing it as \"a million miles from standard chicken tikka masala fare\".\n\n## See also\nBalti\nChicken curry\nGeneral Tso's chicken\nList of chicken dishes\nMughlai cuisine\nPaneer tikka masala\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

Chinese Islamic dishes include clear-broth beef noodle soup and chuanr.\nThe Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslims), Bonan, Dongxiang, Salar and Uyghurs of China, as well as the Dungans of Central Asia and the Panthays of Burma, collectively contribute to Chinese Islamic cuisine.\n\n## History\nDue to the large Muslim population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to or are run by Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in China proper. It is heavily influenced by Beijing cuisine, with nearly all cooking methods identical and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, halal and kosher methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with Genghis Khan who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method.\n\nAmong all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say \"we do not eat Mongol food.\" [Cinggis Qa'an replied:] \"By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?\" He thereupon made them eat. \"If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.\" He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat.\" Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.\n\nTraditionally, there is a distinction between Northern and Southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using lamb and mutton. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. This difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to Northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese and shrimp are rare in comparison to Southern China due to the arid climate of Northern China.\n\nA Chinese Islamic restaurant (Chinese: 淸眞菜館; pinyin: qīngzhēn càiguǎn) can be similar to a Mandarin restaurant with the exception that there is no pork on the menu and the dishes are primarily based on noodles or soup.\nIn most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from western China (e.g., Uyghurs). They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as Islamic calligraphy.\nAnother difference is that lamb and mutton dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. (Refer to image 1.)\nOther Muslim ethnic minorities like the Bonan, Dongxiang, Salar and Tibetan Muslims have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.\nMany cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or Western Chinese minorities), typically labeled \"qingzhen\". Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the Eid feast following Ramadan.\nSeveral Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in Los Angeles.\nMany Chinese Hui Muslims who moved from Yunnan to Burma (Myanmar) are known as Panthays; they operate restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine such as noodles. Chinese Hui Muslims from Yunnan who moved to Thailand are known as Chin Haw and they also own restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic food.\n\nIn Central Asia, Dungan people, descendants of Hui, operate restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine, which is  referred to as Dungan cuisine there. They cater to Chinese businessmen. Chopsticks are used by Dungans. The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine.\nMost Chinese regard Hui halal food as cleaner than food made by non-Muslims, so their restaurants are popular in China. Hui who migrated to Northeast China (Manchuria) after the Chuang Guandong opened many new inns and restaurants to cater to travelers, which were regarded as clean.\nThe Hui who migrated to Taiwan operate Qingzhen restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine in Taipei and other major cities.\nThe Thai Department of Export Promotion claims that \"China's halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards\" to encourage Thai private-sector halal producers to market their products in China.\nA 1903-founded franchise serving Muslim food is Dong Lai Shun in Hankou.\nEach restaurant serving beef noodles must be at least 400 meters from another of its type if they belong to Hui Muslims, since Hui have a pact between each other in Ningxia, Gansu and Shaanxi.\nHalal restaurants are checked up upon by clerics from mosques.\nHalal food manufacture has been sanctioned by the government of the Ningxia Autonomous Region.\n\n## Famous dishes\n\n\n### Lamian\nLamian (simplified Chinese: 拉面; traditional Chinese: 拉麪; pinyin: lāmiàn, Dungan: Ламян) is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (湯麪, даңмян, tāngmiàn), but sometimes stir-fried (炒麪, Чаомян, chǎomiàn) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, 拉, ла (lā) means to pull or stretch, while 麪, мян (miàn) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle. There exists a local variant in Lanzhou, the Lanzhou beef noodles, also known as Lanzhou lamian.\nWords that begin with L are not native to Turkic — läghmän is a loanword as stated by Uyghur linguist Abdlikim: It is of Chinese derivation and not originally Uyghur.\n\n### Beef noodle soup\nBeef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish composed of stewed beef, beef broth, vegetables and wheat noodles. It exists in various forms throughout East and Southeast Asia. It was created by the Hui people during the Qing dynasty of China.\nIn the west, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.\n\n### Chuanr\nChuanr (Chinese: 串儿, Dungan: Чўанр, Pinyin: chuànr (shortened from \"chuan er\"), \"kebab\"), originating in the Xinjiang (新疆) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in Beijing. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the Uyghur (维吾尔) people and other Chinese Muslims. Yang rou chuan or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.\n\n### Suan cai\nSuan cai is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut, used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although suan cai is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially beef noodle soup.\n\n### Nang\nNang (Chinese: 馕, Dungan: Нәң) is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia naan.\n\n## Image gallery\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\narticle on a Chinese Islamic restaurant in the San Francisco Bay area, San Francisco Chronicle.\nchinaheritagequarterly.org Archived 2021-01-21 at the Wayback Machine\nThe Famous Dungan Noodles or Lyu Mian with Eight Seasoning Dishes!\nMore pictures of the Dungan Cuisine",

Sweet rishiki is served with honey and cottage cheese.\n\n## Dry meat dishes\nRondijhzu Barbecued or spit roasted goat or lamb seasoned with only salt.\nTaaw kahak Chicken which is roasted on a griddle with additional pressure applied, usually by placing a rock or heavy pot over it. Very dry and crispy.\nTaaw machhi Fish cooked in the same pressure grilling method as taaw kahak, especially brown trout, rainbow trout and schizothorax.\n\n## Soups\nOne of the most important elements in Chitrali cuisine is the importance of soups, usually eaten as the main dish accompanied by bread and fruit. The cold climate of Chitral is one of the factors contributing to the popularity of soups in Chitrali cuisine.\nKalli A noodle soup made with minced beef and hand-cut whole wheat noodles. It is very similar to the Central Asian laghman and is probably of Chinese origin.\nLeganu Made with tiny lentil-flour dumplings and unlike most Chitrali cuisine it is often quite spicy.\nLajhaik Similar to the Kashmiri hareesa, it is a thick soup of whole wheat and barley grains slowly stewed together with lamb, beef or duck.\nKhhamalogh A soup consisting of the skulls of sheep, goats or cattle crushed and slowly simmered for many hours.\nKawirogh A light soup made with dried wild capers and meat.

    "text": "# Christmas Island cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Christmas Island can best be described as an eclectic combination of traditional Australian cuisine and Asian cuisine, particularly meals from Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\n## Population\nAs of 2009, the island had just 1,200 residents: 65% Chinese Malaysians, 20% Malaysian Malays, and 15% of European descent. There are also small Malaysian Indian and Eurasian communities on the island. \nPreviously an additional 2,000+ people lived at the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. Their meals were flown in by the Australian Government via operator Serco. The centre was closed in October 2018 but re-opened in 2019, and as of early 2020 hosted only one family of Tamil asylum seekers.\n\n## Food supply\nAlmost no fresh food is grown on the island due to nematodes in the soil. However, there are three local gardens on the island that cultivate small amounts of Asian greens. These include a community garden at Drumsite, another small community vegetable patch in Poon Saan, and a temple garden, also located in Poon Saan. Notably, these community gardens feature garden beds built up out of the soil to prevent worms from reaching the surface and risking dehydration, thereby preserving the roots of the vegetables. Some of the Asian greens and vegetables grown in these gardens include bok choy, choy sum, kangkong, Chinese mustard, eggplant, and okra, among others.\nLocals rely on government-contracted deliveries of fresh food from mainland Australia. As of November 2013, an additional air-freight of vegetables arrives from Malaysia via Indonesia every Friday night for purchase on Saturday morning. This air-freight mainly caters to the tastes of the local community, offering fresh noodles, Asian greens, fish, pork belly, bones and fillets, as well as other packaged foods like fish balls and tofu.\nIn recent years, the supply of fresh food has been affected by a number of major incidents. In January 2012, the MV Tycoon crashed into the island's main dock at Flying Fish Cove, preventing subsequent fresh-food deliveries from reaching the island. When food supplies by ship are not available, air-freighted deliveries have been known to sell out within hours.\n\n## Wild food\nDue to the tropical nature of Christmas Island's weather, a wide variety of food grows wild on the island. Fruit trees are found dotted around the island and on private properties. Some of the things that can be found by foraging on Christmas Island include:\n\npapaya\nmango\ncoconut\npumpkin\nchilli\njackfruit\nwild lime\nbunga kantan (also known as laksa flower or torch ginger flower - botanical name Etlingera elatior)\nmanquang (a Chinese turnip also known as jicama)\ntapioca\nlemongrass\nbanana\nguava\nMany other well known tropical fruits such as rambutan, lychee and durian do not grow on Christmas Island as there is inadequate soil depth and not enough steady rainfall throughout the year.\n\n## Meals\nAs a result of supply issues, whole fresh produce can be difficult to acquire and so meals that make use of processed foods and canned foods are popular.\nTraditionally, chickens were kept on the island and locals produced their own pickled eggs and Chinese century eggs. Dishes that made use of the chickens themselves were popular along with dishes that included local coconut crabs. However, coconut crabs are now a protected species.\nThe island has a number of noodle bars offering Chinese and Malaysian dishes in accordance with the traditional cuisines of the island's residents.\n\n## See also\n\nMalaysian cuisine\nAustralian Chinese cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Chutney\n\nA chutney (pronounced [ˈʧəʈɳiː]) is a condiment associated with cuisines of the Indian subcontinent. Chutneys are made in a wide variety of forms, some raw such as with coriander, others cooked with sugar, like mango chutney. During the British Raj, Anglo-Indian cuisine adapted Indian chutney and brought it back to Britain, where green mango chutney in particular became popular. In the Western world, chutneys may be made with local fruits and vegetables, or purchased.\n\n## Etymology and nomenclature\nThe word chutney derives from Hindi चटनी caṭnī, Urdu چٹنی chaṭnī, from चाटना chāṭnā 'to lick, taste'. In South India, chutneys are known as pachadi (Telugu: పచ్చడి, Kannada: ಪಚಡಿ, Tamil: பச்சடி, Malayalam: പച്ചടി, Marathi: पचडी) meaning traditional South Indian sauces or chutneys served as side dishes. Roughly translated, a pachadi is a pounded or crushed plant.\n\n## Description\nIn Indian cuisine, a wide variety of chutneys are used as spicy relishes, eaten in small quantities, to accompany plain staples such as rice. Indian meals typically comprise a dish of meat, a dish of pulses, rice or bread, a yoghurt relish (raita or dahi), and a homemade chutney. \nChutneys can be broadly divided into two groups: simple fresh preparations that must be eaten immediately; and preserves, which are bottled and kept until required. Fresh coriander chutney consists simply of the fresh green leaves ground up with flavourings, such as fresh green chili, lemon juice, salt, cumin, and black pepper. Preserved chutneys contain fruits cooked with sugar and vinegar, and flavoured with spices such as garlic, cayenne pepper, and ginger.\nThe flavourings for fresh chutneys are freshly ground each day, and include spices such as chili and ginger as well as herbs like coriander and mint. The body of the chutney may consist of fruits or vegetables, with regional variations. Coconut chutney is the most used in South India; herb and coconut is liked in Western India, as is garlic chutney; while unripe mango chutney is preferred in North India. Chutneys made only with herbs are used in both Western and North India. Tomato chutney is consumed in all parts of India. In Kashmir, chutneys variously use sour cherries, pumpkins, radishes, or walnuts. \nIn Bangladesh, chutneys may be sweet or spicy-hot, and use a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. An acid foodstuff like lemon juice, tamarind, or vinegar is often added to preserve the chutney. These are flavoured with spices including asafoetida, coriander, cumin, and fenugreek, and herbs such as green coriander and mint.\n\n## History\nThe historian of food Pushpesh Pant suggests that basic chutneys could be the first foods prepared by hunter-gatherers, as they crushed seeds, fruits, and berries to a paste and ate it with raw or cooked foods, making them more palatable.\n\n### Indian cuisine\nSeveral accounts of the early 16th century describe chutneys being eaten. Duarte Barbosa's Book of Duarte Barbosa, written around 1516, narrates scenes in the far south of India of chutney being served to the raja in silver dishes alongside curries and sauces. The Krishnamangal, ascribed to Krishnadasa Kaviraja and published around a decade later, describes chutney prepared in Bengal in a worship context, accompanying dishes including greens and soups. \nThe kitchens of the Mughal court prepared feasts of many dishes, including numerous chutneys with ingredients as diverse as dried fruits, rose petals, and saffron. A story runs that the emperor Shah Jahan's (r. 1628–1658) physicians advised him to eat chutneys with herbs and spices for his digestion.\nChutneys have evolved across India into many regional varieties, such as Karnataka's coconut chutney. Odisha's chaprah chutney, recognised with a geographical indication tag in 2024, is made with red ants as well as chili, garlic, and ginger; the ants directly make the chutney sour with their formic acid. A chutney made with dried fish has been thought to have soothing properties, such as when a person is suffering from malaria.\n\n### Anglo-Indian and British\nIn the 17th century, in the time of the East India Company, British travellers to India noticed the many pickles (achar) and chutneys. Sailors found that the preserve-like varieties were useful accompaniments to their maritime diet of salt meat and dry ship's biscuit. Quantities were brought home to Britain, whether by individual travellers or by merchants, soon to be copied by cooks. \nDuring the British Raj, the British in India prepared many kinds of chutney in their Anglo-Indian cuisine. For the sweet chutneys, fruits such as mango are cooked with sugar, vinegar, and spices. Uncooked chutneys use ingredients such as green coriander leaves and coconut, flavoured with chili, tamarind, and sugar; these are prepared afresh each day. Major Grey's Chutney, a sweet and spicy variety, was supposedly created by an 19th-century British Army officer of the British Raj, adapting Indian cuisine to Anglo-Indian taste. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract, sweetening and spices. Several companies produce a Major Grey's Chutney, in India, the UK and the US. The formula was sold to Crosse and Blackwell, a major British food manufacturer, probably in the early 1800s. \nIn 1896, Edward Palmer founded Veeraswamy & Co. in London, importing chutneys, spices, and curry pastes from India. Instead of Indian limes, mangoes, and tamarind, British cooks used fresh fruits and vegetables such as apples, marrows, and onions, with the addition of dried sultanas. Hot British spices like mustard powder and horseradish substituted for chili. Influenced by Anglo-Indian cuisine, chutney is often eaten with hard cheese or with cold meats. Western-style chutneys may include spices and flavourings such as salt, garlic, tamarind, onion or ginger. A 1998 report on the European ethnic foods market stated that Britain had spent £7.7 million in the previous year on mango chutney alone.\n\n### To other countries\nIn the 18th century, chutney spread from Britain to the American colonies, and then across Europe, eventually becoming a global dish. \nIn the 19th century, British merchants brought indentured Indian sugar workers to the Caribbean; some later settled there, bringing their cuisine with them. In Trinidad and Tobago, chutneys are mostly made from green mangoes, coconut or tamarind. Indian pickles (achar) and chutneys such as mango chutney are used in Malaysian cuisine.\nSouth African Cape Malay chutneys are called blatjang, and are at least somewhat spicy. They can be made using fruits such as apricots, mangoes, or peaches, cooked with vinegar, brown sugar, onions, garlic, and spices. \nIn Australia, \"Tiger Chutney. Pawpaw and Mango, made by the Indian Condiment Co.\" was advertised in the 1950s.\nIn 2024, chutneys (as a class) were placed 41st on the Taste Atlas 100 Best Dips in the World, while coriander chutney was 47th, green chutney 48th, and mango chutney 49th. In the 21st century, a World Chutney Day is celebrated annually on 24 September.\n\n## In culture\nThe 2016 Hindi short film Chutney involves an excellent chutney alongside \"an exceptionally creepy piece of storytelling\" as a timid wife starts to spar with her husband's mistress.\nThe 2024 Tamil-language comedy drama television series Chutney Sambar, named for two contrasting condiments that together make a meal tasty, is described by The Hindu as \"a delectable watch\" because of the interaction of the contrasting characters who run two different food outlets.\nIn countries such as Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad, with a significant Indian diaspora population where chutneys continue to be eaten, \"chutney\" names a music and dance tradition derived from the North Indian sthai-antar refrain-verse musical structure, with a rapid tempo; it symbolises the diaspora's cultural identity.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\n\n\n## Further reading\nFood Safety in Production of Chutney, Pickles.

During colonial times, Cuba was an important port for trade, and the Spanish ancestors of Cubans brought with them the culinary traditions of different parts of Spain.\n\n## Overview\nAs a result of the colonization of Cuba by Spain, one of the main influences on the cuisine is from Spain. Other culinary influences include the Taíno, the indigenous people of Cuba; Africa, from the Africans who were brought to Cuba as slaves; and French, from the French colonists who came to Cuba from Haiti. Another factor is that Cuba is an island, making seafood something that greatly influences Cuban cuisine. Another contributing factor to Cuban cuisine is that Cuba is in a tropical climate, which produces fruits and root vegetables that are used in Cuban dishes and meals.\nA typical meal contains rice and black beans, either cooked together or separately. When cooked together, they are referred to as congrí or Moros or Moros y Cristianos (lit. 'Moors and Christians') with Moros referring to the black beans, and Cristianos to the white rice. If cooked separately, they are simply called arroz con frijoles (rice with beans) or arroz y frijoles (rice and beans).\n\n## Cuban sandwich\nA Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a mixto, especially in Cuba) is a common lunch item that grew out of the once-open flow of cigar workers between Cuba and Florida (specifically Key West and the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa) in the late 19th century and has since spread to other Cuban American communities.\nThe sandwich is built on a base of lightly buttered Cuban bread and contains sliced roast pork, thinly sliced Serrano ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, and yellow mustard. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered in with the other meats, probably due to the influence of Italian immigrants who lived alongside Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. Tomatoes and lettuce are available additions in many restaurants, but these are considered by traditionalists as unacceptable Americanizations of the sandwich.\nAfter assembly, the Cuban sandwich may be pressed in a grooveless panini-type grill called a plancha, which both heats and compresses the contents.\n\n## List of Cuban dishes and foods\n\n\n## List of Cuban drinks\nBatido – Milkshake coming in flavors such as guanabana and trigo (wheat)\nCarajillo – Cuban Espresso, Liquor 43\nCortadito – Cuban espresso and steamed evaporated milk\nCuba Libre – Rum, Coca-Cola, and lime\nCafe Cubano – Cuban espresso\nCuban Piña colada – Aged rum, lime, pineapple, and sugar\nDaiquiri – Rum, Lime, syrup (variations with fruit)\nEl Presidente\nGuarapo – juice made from pressed sugar cane\nHatuey beer\nIronbeer\nJupiña – pineapple soda\nMalta (soft drink) – malt beverage\nMaterva\nMojito – Rum, mint, sugar, lime, and club soda\n\n## See also\nFlattop grill\nLatin American cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\nAróstegui, Gonzalo, et al.: Manual del Cocinero Criollo, Cuba, 19th century.\nBuchmann, Christine. \"Cuban Home Gardens and Their Role in Social–Ecological Resilience.\" Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal 37.6 (2009): 705–721. 16 Jan. 2010.\nCancio-Bello, Carla. \"The Growing Popularity of Cuban Cuisine.\" (2012): http://www.cubancuisine.co.uk\nCarris Alonso, Cynthia. \"A Taste of Cuba: A Journey Through Cuba and its Savory Cuisine.\" ISBN 978-1-948062-00-8 Apollo Publishers, 2018\nFolch, Christine. \"Fine Dining: Race in Prerevolution Cookbooks.\" Latin American Research Review 43.2 (2008): 205–223. 3 Feb. 2010.\nHunt, Nigel. \"The Agriculture History in Cuba.\" Cuba Agriculture. 2008.

    "text": "# Cuisine\n\nA cuisine  is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques, and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs and ingredients combine to enable dishes unique to a region.\n\n## Etymology\nUsed in English since the late 18th century, the word cuisine—meaning manner or style of cooking—is borrowed from the French for 'style of cooking' (literally 'kitchen'), as originally derived from Latin coquere, 'to cook'.\n\n## Influences on cuisine\nA cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Regional ingredients are developed and commonly contribute to a regional or national cuisine, such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine.\nReligious food laws can also exercise an influence on cuisine, such as Indian cuisine and Hinduism that is mainly lacto-vegetarian (avoiding meat and eggs) due to sacred animal worship. Sikhism in Punjabi cuisine, Buddhism in East Asian cuisine, Christianity in European cuisine, Islam in Middle Eastern cuisine, and Judaism in Jewish and Israeli cuisine all exercise an influence on cuisine.\nSome factors that have an influence on a region's cuisine include the area's climate, the trade among different countries, religious or sumptuary laws and culinary culture exchange. For example, a tropical diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables, while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish.\nThe area's climate, in large measure, determines the native foods that are available. In addition, climate influences food preservation. For example, foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking, curing and pickling have remained significant in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties.\nThe trade among different countries also largely affects a region's cuisine. Dating back to the ancient spice trade, seasonings such as cinnamon, cassia, cardamom, ginger and turmeric were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade, and India was a global market for this. Cinnamon and cassia found their way to the Middle East at least 4,000 years ago.\nCertain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws.\nCulinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions: Japan's first substantial and direct exposure to the West came with the arrival of European missionaries in the second half of the 16th century. At that time, the combination of Spanish and Portuguese game frying techniques with an East Asian method for cooking vegetables in oil, led to the development of tempura, the \"popular Japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried\".\n\n## History\nCuisine dates back to classical antiquity. As food began to require more planning, there was an emergence of meals that situated around culture.\n\n## Evolution of cuisine\nCuisines evolve continually, and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction. One recent example is fusion cuisine, which combines elements of various culinary traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s. Nouvelle cuisine ('New cuisine') is an approach to cooking and food presentation in French cuisine that was popularized in the 1960s by the food critics Henri Gault, who invented the phrase, and his colleagues André Gayot and Christian Millau in a new restaurant guide, the Gault-Millau, or Le Nouveau Guide. Molecular cuisine is a modern style of cooking which takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines (molecular cooking). The term was coined in 1999 by the French INRA chemist Hervé This because he wanted to distinguish it from the name Molecular gastronomy (a scientific activity) that was  introduced by him and the late Oxford physicist Nicholas Kurti in 1988. It is also named as multi sensory cooking, modernist cuisine, culinary physics and experimental cuisine by some chefs. Besides, international trade brings new foodstuffs including ingredients to existing cuisines and leads to changes. The introduction of hot pepper to China from South America around the end of the 17th century, greatly influencing Sichuan cuisine, which combines the original taste (with use of Sichuan pepper) with the taste of newly introduced hot pepper and creates a unique mala (麻辣) flavor that's mouth-numbingly spicy and pungent.\n\n## Global cuisine\nA global cuisine is a cuisine that is practiced around the world, and can be categorized according to the common use of major foodstuffs, including grains, produce and cooking fats.\n\n## Regional diversity\nRegional cuisines can vary based on availability and usage of specific ingredients, local cooking traditions and practices, as well as overall cultural differences. Such factors can be more-or-less uniform across wide swaths of territory, or vary intensely within individual regions. For example, in Central and North South America, corn (maize), both fresh and dried, is a staple food, and is used in many different ways. In northern Europe, wheat, rye and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe olive oil is ubiquitous and rice is more prevalent. In Italy, the cuisine of the north, featuring butter and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat pasta and olive oil. In some parts of Greece, gyros is the staple, while in others this role is filled by bread. Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean, common ingredients include lamb, olive oil, lemons, peppers and rice. The vegetarianism practiced in much of India has made pulses (crops harvested solely for the dry seed) such as chickpeas and lentils as important as wheat or rice. From India to Indonesia, the extensive use of spices is characteristic; coconuts and seafood are also used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as seasonings.\n\n### African cuisine\nAfrican cuisines use a combination of locally available fruits, cereals and vegetables, as well as milk and meat products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, curd and whey products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.\n\n### Asian cuisines\nDue to Asia's vast size and extremely diverse geography and demographics, Asian cuisines are many and varied, and include East Asian cuisine, South Asian cuisine, Southeast Asian cuisine, Central Asian cuisine and West Asian cuisine. Ingredients common to East Asia and Southeast Asia (due to overseas Chinese influence) include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy and tofu, with stir frying, steaming and deep frying being common cooking methods. While rice is common to most regional cuisines in Asia, different varieties are popular in the different regions: Basmati rice is popular in South Asia, Jasmine rice in Southeast Asia, and long-grain rice in China and short-grain rice in Japan and Korea. Curry is also a common ingredient found in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia (notably Japanese curry); however, they are not popular in West Asian and Central Asian cuisines. Those curry dishes with origins in South Asia usually have a yogurt base, with origins in Southeast Asia a coconut milk base, and in East Asia a stewed meat and vegetable base. South Asian cuisine and Southeast Asian cuisine are often characterized by their extensive use of spices and herbs native to the tropical regions of Asia.\nIn addition to regional distinctions, Asian cuisines are also shaped by religious and cultural practices. For example, Halal dietary laws influence much of West and South Asian cooking, while Buddhist cuisine emphasizes vegetarian dishes in East Asia. Street food culture is another defining feature across Asia, with night markets in places such as Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea offering a wide variety of inexpensive and ready‑to‑eat meals.  \nGlobalization has also led to the fusion of Asian cuisines with Western styles, resulting in popular dishes such as Korean fried chicken, Japanese sushi rolls adapted with cream cheese or avocado, and Indian curry served in fast‑food formats worldwide.\n\n### European cuisine\nEuropean cuisine (alternatively, \"Western cuisine\") include the cuisines of Europe and other Western countries. European cuisine includes non-indigenous cuisines of North America, Australasia, Oceania and Latin America as well. The term is used by East Asians to contrast with East Asian styles of cooking. When used in English, the term may refer more specifically to cuisine in (Continental) Europe; in this context, a synonym is Continental cuisine.\n\n### Oceanian cuisine\nOceanian cuisines include Australian cuisine, New Zealand cuisine and cuisines from many other islands or island groups throughout Oceania. Australian cuisine consists of immigrant Anglo-Celtic derived cuisine, and Bushfood prepared and eaten by native Aboriginal Australian peoples, and various newer Asian influences. New Zealand cuisine also consists of European inspired dishes, such as Pavlova, and native Māori cuisine. Across Oceania, staples include the Kūmura and Taro, which was/is a staple from Papua New Guinea to the South Pacific. On most islands in the South Pacific, fish are widely consumed because of the proximity to the ocean.\n\n### Cuisines of the Americas\nThe cuisines of the Americas are found across North and South America, and are based on the cuisines of the countries from which the immigrant people came from, primarily Europe. However, the traditional European cuisine has been adapted by the addition of many local and native ingredients, and many of their techniques have been added to traditional foods as well. Native American cuisine is prepared by indigenous populations across the continent, and its influences can be seen on multi-ethnic Latin American cuisine. Many staple foods have been seen to be eaten across the continent, such as corn (maize), beans and potatoes have their own respective native origins. The regional cuisines are North American cuisine, Mexican cuisine, Central American cuisine, South American cuisine and Caribbean cuisine.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nAlbala, Ken (2011).

Most Muslims do not eat pork and other food forbidden by Islamic law. Alcohol is available in Kerala in many hotels, bars and liquor stores.\n\n## Overview\nOne of the traditional Kerala dishes is vegetarian and is called the Kerala sadya. A full-course sadya consists of rice with about 20 different accompaniments and desserts, and is the ceremonial meal usually eaten on celebratory occasions in Kerala, including weddings, Onam and Vishu. It is served on a plantain leaf.\nBecause of its rich trading heritage, over time, various indigenous Kerala dishes have been blended with foreign dishes to adapt them to local tastes. Coconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring.\nKerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with tapioca and is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's food.\nHaving been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, Kerala makes frequent use of black pepper, cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon. Kerala also has a variety of breakfast dishes like idli, dosa, appam, idiyappam, puttu, and pathiri.\n\n## Snacks\nWell-known snacks from Kerala include:\n\nBanana chip - Thinly sliced raw bananas fried in coconut oil, often flavored with salt or jaggery.\nAchappam - A crispy, flower-shaped, deep-fried snack made from rice flour, coconut milk, and eggs.\nKuzhalappam - A cylindrical snack made from rice flour, coconut, cumin, and sesame seeds.\nUnni appam - Deep-fried rice cakes made with jaggery, banana, and coconut.\nEla ada - A steamed snack made with rice flour dough, filled with jaggery and grated coconut, wrapped in banana leaves.\nPazham poori - Bananas are slit lengthwise after peeling and dipped into a batter made from all-purpose flour, salt, turmeric powder and sugar. This is then deep-fried in oil until golden brown.\nNeyyappam  - A sweet rice-based fritter fried in ghee.\nKozhukkatta - Steamed rice dumplings filled with sweet coconut and jaggery.\n\n## Breads\nKerala has a variety of traditional breads prepared by baking or frying.\n\nAppam - A bowl-shaped pancake made with fermented rice batter and coconut milk, typically paired with stew or egg curry\nParotta - It is a layered flatbread made from refined flour and oil.\nDosa - It is a thin, savoury crepe in Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice.\nPathiri - Thin rice flour flatbread popular among the Malabar Muslim community, paired with coconut milk-based curries.\nVattayappam - It is made from rice flour, sugar, and coconut. It is an oil-free tea-time snack.\nKalathappam - A soft, fermented rice pancake made with coconut milk and toddy (or yeast).\nIdiyappam - Thin, steamed rice noodles shaped like nests, served with coconut milk, sugar, or spicy curries.\n\n## Hindu cuisine\nThe vast majority of Kerala's Hindus, except certain communities and ovo-lacto vegetarians, eat fish, red meat (beef, carabeef, and lamb) and chicken. There are many vegetarians in Kerala, also throughout India.\n\n## Mappila cuisine\nMuslim cuisine or Mappila cuisine is a blend of traditional Kerala, Persian, Arab, Portuguese and Western food culture. This confluence of culinary cultures is best seen in the preparation of most dishes. Kallummakkaya (mussels) curry, irachi puttu (irachi meaning meat), Pathiri (a type of rice pancake), and ghee rice are some of the other specialties. The characteristic use of spices is the hallmark of Mappila cuisine—black pepper, cardamom, and clove are used profusely.\nKuzhi Mandi (Mandi (food)) is another popular item, which has an influence from Yemen. Malabar biriyani is known as Thalassery biriyani which uses kaima rice for preparation and is called dum biriyani. Malabar biriyani originated from Thalassery and spread to other places.\nThe snacks include unnakkaya (deep-fried, boiled ripe banana paste covering a mixture of cashew, raisins and sugar), pazham nirachathu (ripe banana filled with coconut grating, molasses or sugar), muttamala made of eggs, chatti pathiri, a dessert made of flour, like a baked, layered chapati with rich filling, arikkadukka, and more.\n\n## Christian cuisine\nChristians of Kerala, especially Nasranis (Saint Thomas Christians), have their own cuisine, which is a blend of Indian, Middle Eastern, Syrian, Jewish and Western styles and flavours of cooking.\nA commonly served dish among Kerala Christians is mappas, or ishtu. For this dish, chicken or beef, potatoes, carrots, green peas and onions are simmered gently in coconut milk flavoured with black pepper, cinnamon, coriander, mint, cloves, green chillies, lime juice, and shallots. In Central Kerala, this is made only with beef or lamb; the usage of chicken in stew is very rare. Lamb and duck can replace chicken in the stew recipe.\nPidi is another dish made mainly by Syrian Christians from Central Kerala, consisting of dumplings made from rice flour boiled in a mixture of coconut milk, cumin seeds and garlic.\nOther dishes include piralen (chicken stir-fried), meat thoran/roast/ullathiyathu (dry curry with shredded coconut), seafood and duck roast, and meen molee (spicy stewed fish). This is eaten with appam. Pork vindaloo and meen mulakittathu or meen vatichathu (fish in fiery red chilli sauce) is another commonly served item.\nLatin Christian ceremonial food includes bread and stew. They are served after cake and wine at the banquet, followed by a meal that includes fish, cutlets, salads, pork, vindaloo, fish moli, duck roast and mustad (mustard and coriander skins fried in vinegar).\nIrachi ularthiathu, also known as Kerala beef fry, is a beef dish cooked with spices.\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nWikibooks Cookbook: Cuisine of India",

Similarly, some notable foods like—kheer, sponge mishti, Mahasthangarh's chauler katkati, lachcha semai, seekh kebab, chicken and beef chaap, red chili, potato ghati, etc.—are also quite well-known. Since ancient times, khichuri has been common and popular in the cuisine of North Bengal.\n\n## Kalai Roti\nKalai Roti is available in the Chapainawabganj district of Bangladesh. In this region, it is a widely consumed food item like fish-rice-lentil. Shops selling Kalai Roti can be seen almost everywhere in the city. Besides this district, Kalai Roti is also becoming popular in northern regions like Rajshahi, Naogaon, and even in Dhaka.\nFirst, mashkalai and atap rice are ground into flour using a Batan or a janta (traditional stone grinders). Though Kalai Roti can be made with flour prepared by machines, the taste is enhanced when flour ground on a Batan is used. Salt as per taste and required amount of water are mixed with the flour to make a dough. Small balls are taken from the dough and shaped into circles. Then, using the palms, these are rotated and flattened to make large rotis.\nUsually, Kalai Roti is thicker and larger than wheat roti. Then the roti is heated on a clay tawa (flat pan). When the color of the roti turns brown, it is taken off the heat.\nKalai Roti is generally served with mashed eggplant, mashed dried chili, bot, mashed onion, fried meat, etc. The roti is torn into pieces and eaten hot with these accompaniments.\n\n## Pelka\nPelka or Pyalka is a type of soup-like food whose main ingredient is leafy greens or leaf vegetables. It is very popular in ancient North Bengal or present-day northern Bangladesh (greater Rangpur Division), as well as in the Indian districts of Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar, and the Goalpara region of Assam.\nThough it initially originated in areas where napa shak broth is eaten (such as Nilphamari district), it has now spread throughout the region. Various greens are used, such as Malva parviflora, drumstick leaves, taro leaves, Basella alba, pumpkin greens, bathua, kakri, babri, soluk, coriander, onion, garlic, chili, salt, and baking soda. However, the amount and type of ingredients may vary depending on the region or personal preference.\nThe different greens are cleaned and put together in a pot. Then salt, green chili, water, and a small amount of baking soda are mixed in. The pot is then covered and put on the stove to boil. It is stirred occasionally.\nA notable feature of Pelka is that no oil is used in cooking it. The baking soda helps the greens cook thoroughly.\n\n## Egg curry with water\nEgg Curry with Water and Oil, or simply Egg Telani, is a popular egg dish from North Bengal. The ingredients used to make it are: eggs, oil, cardamom, bay leaf, cinnamon, chopped onions, ginger paste, garlic paste, green chili paste, cumin paste, an appropriate amount of water, and garam masala paste.\nFirst, eggs are fried in oil in a pan. Then, cardamom, bay leaf, cinnamon, and chopped onions are lightly sautéed. After that, ginger paste, garlic paste, green chili paste, cumin paste, and water are mixed well in a bowl. This mixed spice paste is then poured into the frying pan or pan.\nAfter adding the fried eggs, it's cooked for a while. Finally, when the gravy thickens, it is taken off the stove.\nThis egg telani can be served with hot rice, roti, paratha, or polao.\n\n\n== References ==",

Many sweets of the region are based on chhena (cheese).\n\n## Ingredients and seasoning\nRice is a major crop of Odisha. Lentils such as pigeon peas and moong beans are other major ingredients.\nIndigenous vegetables used in Odia cuisine are pumpkin, gourd, plantains, jackfruit, and papaya. Vegetables such as potatoes, cauliflowers, and cabbages are also used alongside local vegetables.\nPancha phutana is a blend of five spices that is widely used in Odia cuisine. It contains mustard, cumin, fenugreek, aniseed and kalonji (onion seeds). Curry Leaves, Garlic, onion, ginger, turmeric, tamarind and coconut are other commonly used ingredients in most of the dishes.\n\n## Local variation\nThe food in the region around Puri and Cuttack is greatly influenced by the Jagannath Temple. On the other hand, kalonji and mustard paste are used mostly in every part of the state. In the regions closer to Andhra Pradesh, like Brahmapur, due to the influence of South Indian cuisine, curry leaves and tamarind are used more.\n\n## Temple food\nTemples in the region make offerings to the presiding deities. The prasada of the Jagannath Temple is specifically called Mahaprasad meaning greatest of all prasadas. It consists of 60 recipes/dishes, so it is called Sathie Pauti.\nAnother misconception that people refer is that the Mahaprasad consists of 56 dishes (called Chhapana Bhoga). It is however false, as this concept prevails in the present day Vrindavan/Braj region, which is based on the legend that Krishna missed his eight meals for seven days, while trying to save a village from a storm holding up the Govardhan hill, as a shelter.\nWhile in Odia Tradition, the Bhoga is referred to as ସାଠିଏ ପଊଟି (Sathie Pauti), as The Principal Prasad prepared for Jagannath consists of 60 dishes (called Abadha Mahaprasad).

    "text": "# Cuisine of Réunion\n\nThe Creole cuisine of Réunion is the food, culinary technique and typical dishes of the island of Réunion, France's dependency in the Indian Ocean. It is identified as Creole cuisine (in French, Créole) because it is a mixture of eating habits and colonial culinary customs with native ingredients. It is strongly influenced by Malagasy cuisine (from Madagascar), as well as other cuisines from East Africa. It also incorporates elements of French cuisine, due to colonization, as well as more recently Indian and Chinese, brought by Indian and Chinese immigrants respectively. The Réunion diet is naturally spicy, flavorful, and relatively consistent.\n\n## Appetizers\nIn La Reunion, the aperitif (appetizer) or entrée plays an important role as an integral part of a meal. Fries are especially popular, although there are notable exceptions such as steamed bouchons. Some typical snacks are:\n\nSamosas, called samoussas, a fried dumpling with a multitude of different fillings typical of the Middle East. Cheese, chicken, fish and potato are very popular, but there are also varieties like pizza, or sweet samoussas with chocolate and banana or pineapple.\nThe bonbon piment (\"bonbon enchilado\"), fried salty and spicy cookies, typically made of lima beans or other legumes, herbs and spices like chili and cumin.\nThe bouchon, a dumpling of Chinese origin and stuffed with minced meat. They are served with siaw (soy sauce). Also typical is the bouchon sandwich.\nPain bouchon\nStuffed pepper peanuts, a simple popular snack\nChicken croquette\n\n## Dishes\nAlways accompanied by white rice, the most common dishes are cari (a local version of the Indian curry), rougail and jugged meats (civets in French). Curry consists of a base of onion, garlic and spices such as turmeric (called safran péï on the island) and masalé (the local version of garam masala), in which fish, meat, eggs, and tomato are cooked. Dishes can also be optionally flavored with ginger. Combava zest and curry leaf (called kaloupilé) are also very popular. Chop suey (rice, not pasta) and other Asian dishes like pork with pineapple are also very common.\nIt is almost always served with some type of legume (grains), such as broad beans, locust beans or the famous lentils from Cilaos, for example, but also with cooked vegetables (brèdes) or raw, such as bleda (also called yerba de Pará, paracres or morning bleda).\nOther common garnishes are pickles (called achard de legumes, derived from the Indian achaar; often made with cabbage, carrots and green beans or palm hearts and spiced with garlic, chili, cumin, turmeric, ginger and vinegar), rougail (a mixture of chopped tomato, onion, chili, and ginger) or fresh tomatoes, aubergines, or green mango, all highly seasoned.\nA popular dish is rougail saucisses, made with rougail chicken or pork sausage, a tomato sauce, chili, spices, and ginger. It will preferably be accompanied by white or zembrocal rice (rice cooked with turmeric, which incorporates red beans or peas).\nIn general, vegetarian dishes are rare in the Reunion diet, although there are choices, such as gratin de chouchou (chayote gratin). Various kinds of poultry are consumed. Although there are others; one of the local specialties is the civet de tenrec. The traditional way of preserving meat is boucanage, and cooking is done in cast iron pots. Traditionally, the main course was also prepared in the patio, over a wood fire, or in a small out-of-home unit, called the boucan. Then it was eaten on a banana leaf and often eaten by hand.\nCari tangue\n\nWhile the people of Réunion generally have similar lifestyles and eating habits, there are variations among the population's different ethnic and religious communities. For instance, Réunion Muslims follow Islamic dietary law, abstaining from pork and, consequently, not consuming rougail saucisse. However, they do share more recipes with the neighboring Mauritius than other Réunionais groups, including dishes like the briani. The Petit blancs des hauts, a Réunion ethnic group traditionally considered to be lower-class, consume small pickles or curry spices, unlike malbares (Indian community).\n\n## Drinks\nAn aperitif or snack is usually accompanied by a punch (blow) or an \"arranged rum\" (rhum arrangé). It is a white rum that usually carries some fruit (such as lychee, mango, or pineapple), leaves, and seeds macerated for weeks. It is taken at any time of the day, even in the morning.\nAnother typical drink is tamarind syrup. The sodas made from pineapple, lychee, lemon, and other fruits grown on the island are also popular, although sometimes they are replaced by international drinks.\nIn Réunion a wine is produced, the Cilaos. It is red, white or rosé and the dominant varieties are pinot noir, malbec and chenin. It comes from Cilaos, in the mountainous area of the island and its production is very low (14 ha).\nThe Brasseries de Bourbon, which is now owned by Heineken, is the only major producer of beer. Bourbon beer is locally known as Dodo, and around the island, the slogan \"la Dodo lé la” (the dodo is here) is commonly painted on snack shops. Other popular beers include Phoenix from Mauritius and Kronenbourg 1664.\n\n## Desserts\nSeasonal fruits are a very common and simple dessert: in the summer mangoes, lychees, longans and Victoria-type pineapple, a sweet variety from nearby Mauritius; in winter, goyaviers (small guavas, that are an invasive plant in much of Réunion’s forests).\nAs for pastries, several local cookies that are very popular, including the bonbon la rouroute (\"arrowroot bonbon\"), the \"bonbon tie\", and the bonbon honey (\"honey bonbon\").\nIn pastry, the gâteau patate (\"potato pie\"), the gâteau ti'son (corn pie), the seasonal fruit tart, the beignets de bananes (\"banana fritters\") are famous. Starch cakes, cassava, yams, and sweet potatoes are also common.\n\n## Special occasions\nFor the New Year, typical pâté créole (Creole pate), whose filling is made of pork curry, called godivo, the dough is a mixture of curry sauce with flour and lard, and flavored with turmeric, accompanied by a little anise liqueur.\n\n## References\nCuisine réunionnaise | Habiter La Réunion» (en francés).

Bonda (Tamil: போண்டா)\n\n## Chemistry of Tamil cuisine\nThe chemistry of Tamil cuisine refers to the biochemical and physicochemical processes involved in its ingredients, preparation methods, and digestion. Traditional Tamil meals incorporate fermented foods, organic acids, plant fibres, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, all of which influence flavour, preservation, nutrient availability, and digestive physiology.\nFood chemistry research has examined fermentation, organic acid composition, starch digestibility, and lipid content in cereal- and pulse-based diets typical of South India, including Tamil cuisine.\n\n### Fermentation and microbial chemistry\nFermentation is a central biochemical process in many Tamil foods, including idli, dosa, and curd (yogurt). These foods are produced through lactic-acid fermentation by microorganisms such as Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Streptococcus species.\nFermentation contributes to several chemical and nutritional changes, including:\nProduction of organic acids, especially lactic acid, which lowers pH and enhances microbial stability.\nPartial breakdown of starch and proteins, improving digestibility.\nSynthesis of bioactive compounds and B-group vitamins.\nFermented dairy products such as curd contain live lactic acid bacteria, which are widely studied for their role in gut microbial ecology and food preservation.\n\n### Organic acids and flavour chemistry\nTamil cuisine commonly uses natural acidulants such as tamarind (Tamarindus indica), tomato, and citrus. Tamarind contains organic acids including tartaric acid, which contributes to sour taste and preservation properties.\nOrganic acids influence food chemistry by:\nModifying flavour through sourness perception.\nIncreasing mineral solubility and bioavailability.\nContributing to preservation by inhibiting microbial growth.\nPickled foods (oorugai) and fermented batters contain lactic and acetic acids, which play important roles in flavour development and shelf stability.\nMacronutrient composition and digestion\nTamil meals typically combine cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fats, producing a nutritionally balanced composition of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and dietary fibre.\nMajor biochemical components include:\n\nCarbohydrates from rice and millets, primarily in the form of starch.\nProteins from lentils, dairy, and animal products.\nLipids from coconut, sesame oil, and ghee.\nDietary fibre from vegetables and legumes, which influences digestion and glycaemic response.\nDietary fibre and resistant starch present in legumes and cereals can slow glucose absorption and influence gut microbial metabolism.\n\n### Lipids and fat chemistry\nFats in Tamil cuisine include plant-derived lipids such as coconut oil and sesame oil, as well as animal fats such as ghee. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fatty acids, particularly lauric acid, while sesame oil contains unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant compounds such as sesamol.\nThese lipids contribute to flavour, energy density, and fat-soluble vitamin absorption.\n\n### Food structure and physicochemical properties\nThe physical and chemical structure of Tamil foods is influenced by cooking techniques such as boiling, steaming, roasting, and frying. Heat treatment alters starch gelatinisation, protein denaturation, and lipid oxidation, affecting texture, flavour, and digestibility.\nSteaming, commonly used for foods such as idli, results in gelatinisation of starch granules and formation of a porous structure, which contributes to softness and digestibility.\n\n### Nutrient bioavailability\nInteractions between food components affect nutrient absorption. For example:\nFermentation can reduce antinutritional factors such as phytic acid, improving mineral absorption.\nOrganic acids enhance solubility of minerals such as iron and calcium.\nDietary fibre influences gastrointestinal transit and microbial metabolism.\nThese physicochemical and microbiological processes contribute to the flavour, preservation, and nutritional characteristics of Tamil cuisine.\n\n## Nutritional classification of Tamil cuisine\nTamil cuisine includes a wide range of plant-based, animal-based, and preserved foods that collectively provide carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre. The cuisine incorporates cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, seafood, and preserved foods such as dried fish and pickles, contributing to a nutritionally diverse dietary pattern.\nTraditional Tamil diets include both fresh and preserved foods, particularly in coastal and rural regions, where drying, salting, and fermentation have historically been used to extend shelf life and maintain nutrient availability.\n\n### Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are the primary source of dietary energy in Tamil cuisine and are obtained mainly from cereals, millets, and starchy tubers.\nMajor carbohydrate sources include:\nRice, including white rice, parboiled rice, and red rice\nMillet varieties such as finger millet (ragi), pearl millet (kambu), and sorghum (cholam)\nFermented cereal-based foods such as idli and dosa\nTubers such as tapioca, yam, and sweet potato\nThese foods provide starch as well as dietary fibre, B-group vitamins, and essential minerals.\n\n### Proteins\nProtein in Tamil cuisine is obtained from both plant and animal sources.\n\n## Regional cuisine\nEach area where Tamils have lived has developed its own distinct variant of the common dishes. The four divisions of ancient Tamilakam prepare their unique Tamil cuisine.\n\n### Chola Nadu\nThe cuisine of the Chola Nadu region specializes in several dishes such as sevai and other varieties associated with different sauces like chutney. The most common dishes are from Chidambaram. Kumbakonam is famous for its filter coffee. The Thanjavur region is one of the prominent producers of rice-based dishes like puliyodharai, sambar sadham, vegetable rice and podi sadham. Millet dishes like kutharai vali dosai are also prepared. Freshwater fish from the area of Thiruchirapalli are famous for their unique taste.\n\n### Pandiya Nadu\nThe Chettinad region and its adjoining areas such as Karaikudi are famous for its typical spicy cuisine also known as chettinad cuisine. Dishes like idiyappam, uthappam, paniyaram as well as meat dishes are common in this region. The Madurai region has its own unique dishes such as Muttaiparotta, Paruthipal, Karidosai, Jasmine Idli, Irameen Kuzhambu and it is the place of origin of the milk dessert Jigarthanda. Non vegetarian dishes from Thirunelveli,Madurai and its adjoining areas are one of the most renowned among the South Indians. The Virudhunagar region is famous for the Coin Parotta. Unlike the traditional way of preparation, Coin Parotta is generally deep fried in oil and served with mutton gravy.\n\n### Kongu Nadu\nKongu Nadu cuisine was originally prepared in rural areas. Oputtu, Sandahai and Kola urundai are few among the main dishes. Many dishes in Kongu Nadu are coconut- and onion-based, as the region has an abundant supply of coconut, onions and groundnuts. Thengai paal jaggery, Ulundu Kali, Kachayam, Arisimparupu sadam, Kelvaragu Puttumavu, Arisi Puttumavu, Paniyaram, Kelvaragu Pakoda, Thengai barbi, Kadalai urundai, Ellu urundai and Pori urundai are among other dishes prepared by Tamil people. Most people living in the region usually consume mutton, chicken, freshwater fishes and quail as the region is landlocked. Arisimparupu sadam is a unique dish. Most common oils are sesame and groundnut oil. Coconut oil is used for main cooking and as well as seasoning in certain Kongu Nadu dishes.\n\n### Tondaimandalam\nThe cuisine of this regions shares similarities with Telugu cuisine due to geographic proximity. Hot and spicy vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes are prepared. Idli, dosai, bhajji, koottu, murukku, vada curry and chicken 65 are common dishes in this region.\n\n## Tamil culinary words in English\n\"Curry\" comes from the Tamil word kari.\nThe Tamil phrase milagu thanneer refers to \"pepper soup\", literally pepper water or mulligatawny\n\"Congee\" is derived from the Tamil word kanji.\n\"Mango\" came to English via Portuguese, which got it from the Tamil maankai.\n\n## Dishes\nRice is the staple food of most Tamil people. It is generally eaten during lunch and sometimes dinner. Soru (Tamil word for 'rice') is served along with other food items such as sambar, poriyal, rasam, kootu, Keerai and curd.\n\n### Breakfast dishes\n\n\n### Lunch and dinner dishes\n\n\n### Sweet dishes\n\n\n### Snacks\nMurukku\nSeedai\nBajji\nKara Sev\nPakoda\nbonda\ntypes of vadai (ulundhu, Kara, aamai)\nThattu vadai/nippetu'\nBoondhi\nKara pori\naval pori\n\n## See also\nTamil\nCuisine of India\nCuisine of Pondicherry\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nAmmal, Meenakshi, S., The Best of Samaithu Paar: The Classic Guide to Tamil Cuisine: Penguin Books India\nDeWitt, Dave and Nancy Gerlach. 1990.

    "text": "# Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies\n\nThe cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies includes the foodways, culinary culture and cooking methods of the Colonial United States and its people. The cuisine adapted as colonists expanded deeper into the unfamiliar new environment.\n\n## Region\n\n\n### Virginia and Maryland\nIn the early 17th century, the first wave of English immigrants began arriving in North America, settling mainly around the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia and Maryland.  The first settlers were poor farmers and severe famines took place before 1612. After that, according to Lois Green Carr, about 130,000 European settlers the majority of whom were English came to Maryland and Virginia in the seventeenth century. Three-fourths were poor people who came as indentured servants,needed for work in the labour intensive, highly profitable tobacco crop. Life expectancy was lower than in England. Unfamiliar New World diseases caused high death rates. Indian corn was the main source of nourishment. There were still periods when food was scarce, and in 1680 Lord Culpeper, the Governor of Virginia was worried about the servants revolting due to hunger.\nCooking in southern England was noted for a tendency toward frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes a good amount of claret. Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.\n\n### New England\nNew England had a great abundance of wildlife and seafood. Traditional East Anglian fare was preferred, even though it had to be made with New World ingredients.\nBaked beans and pease porridge were everyday fare, particularly during the winter, and usually eaten with coarse, dark bread. At first, it was made with a mixture of wheat and maize (corn), but a disease struck in the 1660s called wheat rust, after which it was made of rye and maize, creating what was later known as \"rye an injun\".  Vegetables with thoroughly  boiled meat was a popular dish, and they were cooked together rather than separately,  and frequently without seasoning. Baking was a favorite method of cooking, and New England was the origin of dishes today seen as quintessentially American, such as baked turkey.\n\n### Delaware Valley and Mid-Atlantic region\nThe Quakers emigrated to the New World from the East Midlands during the 17th century, and eventually settled primarily in the Delaware Valley. They were similar to the Puritans in the strictness that they applied to everyday life, though their religious teachings were far different. Their food was plain and simple. Excessive consumption was discouraged and failure to eat or drink moderately was punished with public acts of criticism.\nWilliam Penn was the founder of Pennsylvania and an important figure in the development of the Quaker movement, and he encouraged frugality in his followers with advice such as, \"If thou rise with an appetite thou are sure never to sit down without one\". The Quakers, like the Puritans, encountered an abundance of food in the New World: forests rich with game and berries, streams teeming with fish, and abundant flocks of birds. Still, the asceticism persevered.\nMany Quakers avoided eating butter as a form of self-mortification, and the most eccentric followers would avoid tea and meat. The idealist and pacifist ideas of the Quakers also encouraged many to boycott products that were considered to be tainted by sin. This included butter, due to its role in raising war taxes, and coffee, because it was produced by slave labor.\nEating habits were more egalitarian than those of either the Puritans or the Virginian Anglicans. At meals, entire households would dine at the same table, including children and servants.\nThe most typical cooking method of the Quakers was boiling, a method brought from ancestral northern England. Boiled breakfast and dinner were standard fares, as well as \"pop-robbins\", balls of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Boiled dumplings and puddings were so common in Quaker homes that they were referred to by outsiders as \"Quaker food\".  The Quakers ate cornmeal, elk, venison and wild turkey along with puddings and desserts.\nTravelers noted apple dumplings as an almost daily dish in the Delaware Valley and cookbooks specialized in puddings and dumplings. Food was mostly preserved through boiling, simmering or standing.\nA popular genre of dishes made from this favored method of food preparation was \"cheese\" (or \"butter\"), a generic term for dishes prepared by slow boiling or pressing. They could be made from ingredients as varying as apples (i.e., apple butter), plums and walnuts.\nCream cheese had its origins in Quaker cooking, but was in colonial times not true cheese made with rennet or curds, but rather cream that was warmed gently and then allowed to stand wrapped in the cloth until it became semi-solid.\nDried beef was widely popular in the Delaware Valley and was eaten along with puddings and dumplings to add flavor. The use of dried beef was so widespread that it was often called \"Quaker gravy\" in the 18th century.\nAlthough the Quaker influence from the northern Midlands was the most dominant, there was some influence from German immigrants during the 18th century. Scrapple, a pot pudding made from meat scraps and grain, became a staple of the regional cuisine for many generations.\n\n### Backcountry\nThe last major wave of British immigrants to the colonies took place in 1720–1775. About 250,000 people traveled across the Atlantic primarily to seek economic betterment and to escape severe economic hardships. Most of these came from Ireland and were of Scots-Irish or Irish  descent.\nMany were poor and therefore accustomed to hard times, setting them apart from the other major British immigrant groups. They settled in what would come to be known generally as the \"backcountry\", on the frontier and in the highlands in the north and south.\nA typical breakfast could be toasted bread, cheese, and any leftover meat or vegetables from the previous dinner. In summer, people drank fresh milk.\nThe backcountry relied heavily on a diet based on mush made from soured milk or boiled grains. Clabber, a yogurt-like food made with soured milk, was a standard breakfast dish and was eaten by backcountry settlers of all ages.\nThis dietary habit was not shared by other British immigrant groups and was equally despised by those still in Britain. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason, who spent time among Ulster Irish immigrants, described them as depending \"wholly on butter, milk, clabber and what in England is given to hogs\".\nPorridge  was a popular meal in the British borderlands and remained popular in America. The only difference was that the oatmeal was replaced by corn, and is still known today in the South as grits. Cakes of unleavened dough baked on bakestones or circular griddles were common and went by names such as \"clapbread\", \"griddle cakes\" and \"pancakes\".\nWhile the potato had originated in South America, it did not become established in North America until it was brought to the colonies by northern British settlers in the 18th century and became an important backcountry staple along with corn.\nThe habit of eating \"sallet\" or \"greens\" remained popular, but the vegetables of the Old World were replaced with plants like squashes, gourds, beans, corn, land cress, and pokeweed.\nThe distinctive cooking of the American backcountry was boiling. Along with clabber, porridge, and mushes, the typical dishes were various stews, soups and pot pies.\nFood was eaten from wooden or pewter trenchers with two-tined forks, large spoons, and hunting knives. Dishware was not popular since it was easily breakable and tended to dull knives quickly.\nExcept for the Quakers and Puritans, feasting with an abundance of food and drink was never discouraged and practiced as often as was feasible. Generally, backcountry cuisine shared neither the religious austerity of the North nor the refinement of the South and was therefore ridiculed by outsiders.\nAn apparent lack of fastidiousness in preparing the food provoked further criticism from many sources. The Anglican Woodmason characterized backcountry cooking as \"exceedingly filthy and most execrable\".\nOthers told of matrons washing their feet in the cook pot, that it was considered unlucky to wash a milk churn and that human hairs in butter were considered a sign of quality.  These descriptions seem to be confirmed by an old saying attributed to Appalachian housewives: \"The mair [more] dirt the less hurt\".\nAnother expression of backcountry hardiness was the lack of appreciation of coffee and tea. Both were described as mere \"slops\" and were deemed appropriate only for those who were sick or unfit for labor.\n\n## Diet before the American Revolution\nWhen colonists arrived in America, they planted familiar crops from the Old World with varying degrees of success and raised domestic animals for meat, leather, and wool, as they had done in Britain.\nThe colonists faced difficulties owing to different climate and other environmental factors, but trade with Britain, continental Europe, and the West Indies allowed them to create a cuisine similar to the various regional British cuisines.\nLocal plants and animals offered tantalizing alternatives to the Old World diet, but the colonists held on to old traditions and tended to use these items in the same fashion as they did their Old-World equivalents (or even ignore them if more familiar foods were available).\nThe American colonial diet varied depending on region, with local cuisine patterns established by the mid-18th century.\nA preference for British cooking methods is apparent in cookbooks brought to the New World.  There was a general disdain for French cookery, even among the French Huguenots in South Carolina and French Canadians. One cookbook common in the colonies, The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, by Hannah Glasse, held the French style of cookery in disdain, stating \"the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook!\" She does add French recipes to the text but speaks out flagrantly against the dishes, \"... think(ing) it an odd jumble of trash.\"\n\n### Crops\nA number of vegetables were grown in the northern colonies, including turnips, onions, cabbage, carrots, and parsnips, along with pulses and legumes.  These vegetables stored well through the colder months. Other vegetables, such as cucumbers, could be salted or pickled for preservation.\nAgricultural success in the northern colonies came from following the seasons, with consumption of fresh greens only occurring during summer months.\nIn addition to vegetables, a large number of seasonal fruits were grown. Fruits not eaten in season were often preserved as jam, wet sweetmeats, dried, or cooked into pies that could be frozen during the winter months.\nSome vegetables originating in the New World, including beans, squashes, and corn, were readily adopted and grown by the European colonists. Pumpkins and gourds grew well in the northern colonies and were often used for fodder for animals in addition to human consumption.\n\n### Animal protein\nGame hunting was a familiar beneficial skill to the colonists when they immigrated to the New World. Most northern colonists depended upon hunting, whether they hunted themselves or purchased game from others. As a method of obtaining protein for consumption, hunting was preferred over animal husbandry as domestic animals were expensive and more work was required to defend domestic animals against natural predators, Native Americans, or the French.\nCommonly hunted game included deer, bear, buffalo, and turkey. The larger parts of the animals were roasted and served with currant and other sauces, while smaller portions went into soups, stews, sausages, pies, and pasties.\nVenison was the most popular game. The plentiful meat was often potted or jerked, and its tripe was popular as well. Venison was especially popular during the Thanksgiving season.\nBuffalo was an important protein source until roughly 1770, when the animals were over-hunted in British America. Bear were numerous in the northern colonies, especially in New York, and many considered the leg meat to be a delicacy. Bear meat was frequently jerked as a preservation method.\n\nIn addition to game, mutton was consumed from time to time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton.\nSheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage.\nForage-based diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.\nFats and oils derived from animals were used to cook many colonial foods. Rendered pork fat, especially from bacon, was the most popular cooking medium. Pork fat was used more often in the southern colonies than the northern colonies as the Spanish introduced pigs earlier to the south.\nMany homes kept a deerskin sack filled with bear oil for use in cooking.  Solidified bear fat resembled shortening. The colonists used butter in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the American Revolution, as cattle were not yet plentiful.\nColonists near the shores in New England often dined on fish, crustaceans and other sea animals. Colonists ate large quantities of turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder.\nThe highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.\n\n### Alcohol\nHard apple cider was by far the most common alcoholic beverage available to colonists.\nCider was also easier to produce than beer or wine, so it could be made by farmers for their own consumption. Since it was not imported, it was much more affordable to the average colonist than beer or wine.\nApple trees were planted in both Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1629. Most of these trees were not grafted, and thus produced apples too bitter or sour for eating; they were planted expressly for making cider.\nCider was sometimes also distilled or freeze-distilled into applejack (so called because freeze-distillation was called \"jacking\"); the cold climate of the Northeast in the wintertime encouraged the process. The beverage was particularly popular in New Jersey, where applejack was occasionally called \"Jersey lightning\" and was sometimes used to pay road-construction crews.\nBefore the Revolution, New Englanders consumed large quantities of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively easy access to the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies.\nIn the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.\nBeer was such an important consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked about the quality of barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere.\nIn addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.\n\n### Northern colonies\nA striking characteristic of the diet in New England was the seasonal availability of food. While farming in the southern colonies took place for most of the year, northern growing seasons were more restricted, limiting the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables.\nHowever, the coastal colonists' proximity to the ocean gave them a bounty of fresh fish to supplement their diet year-round, especially in the north.\nWheat, the grain primarily used in English bread, was almost impossible to grow in the North, and imports of wheat were expensive. Substitutes included corn (maize) in the form of cornmeal.  The johnnycake was generally considered a poor substitute for wheaten bread, but was accepted by residents in both the northern and southern colonies.\n\n### Southern colonies\nUnlike the north, the south did not have a central cultural origin or a single culinary tradition.  The southern colonies were also more diverse in their agricultural products.\nSlaves and poor Europeans in the South shared a similar diet, based on many of the indigenous New World crops. The rural poor often hunted and ate squirrel, opossum, rabbit, and other woodland animals. Salted or smoked pork often supplemented the vegetable diet.\nThose on the \"rice coast\" ate ample amounts of rice, while the southern poor and slaves used cornmeal in breads and porridges. Wheat was not an option for most poorer residents in the southern colonies.\nWell into the 18th century, the Chesapeake Bay region still relied on home-brewed cider as a primary beverage. In most small planters' households, women were responsible for the production of the drink and relied on local products to make the different ciders. This production was seasonal, as only large planters had the funds and the technology necessary to produce alcohol year round.\nThe southern colonies can be culturally divided between the uplands and the lowlands, and this distinction is seen in diet and food preparation in the two regions.\nThe diet of the uplands often included cabbage, string beans, and white potatoes.\nThose who could grow or afford wheat often had biscuits on their table for breakfast, along with healthy portions of pork. Salt pork was a staple of any meal, as it was used in the preparations of vegetables for flavor, in addition to its direct consumption as a protein.\nThe coastal lowlands' more varied diet, particularly surrounding Charleston and New Orleans and which also included much of the Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, as well as the French. Rice played a large part in the diet.\nIn addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today.\nAlthough the American colonists had an inherent disdain for French food as well as many of the native foods, the French had no such disdain for indigenous foodstuffs. Conversely, they expressed an appreciation for native ingredients and dishes.\n\n## Dietary changes through boycott\nThe colonists were dependent on Great Britain for imports of food and other basic products.  When taxes and British parliamentary tariffs on products used by the American colonists increased, the colonists were to continue importing English and West Indian goods.\nAs a result, a number of colonists began to boycott imported goods in favor of domestic goods. The boycott was not initially widespread, especially as it could not be officially enforced, and so lacked luster in a number of regions. Increasing support for this boycott, however, helped generate the revolution against Britain.\n\nAs Parliament imposed a series of acts upon the colonists, changes in the American colonists' purchases and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act 1733, followed by the Sugar Act 1764, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred.\nThis was more than a protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.\nThe production of whiskey was not a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until the time of the American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies.\nWhatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the unpopular economic controls introduced by Parliament.\n\nThe Revenue Act of 1764 that heavily taxed Madeira and other wines led to yet another boycott, this time against imported wines. This promoted another indigenous agricultural item of the American Colonies, the Vitis labrusca grapes. In 1765, Benjamin Franklin decided to use Poor Richard's Almanack to promote the growing of American grapes in order to encourage the production of domestic wines.\nOne of Franklin's friends, Benjamin Gale, stated one evening at one of their gatherings \"We must drink wine of our own making or none at all.\" This opinion seemed to be the prevailing sentiment in the colonies from 1764 until the Revolution.\nMany who supported temperance in the colonies also supported the production of American wine at this time, since the colonial form of temperance at the time was to drink only wine or beer instead of hard spirits.\nThe Quartering Act of 1765, probably more than anything else, stripped the colonists of funds and thus the ability to purchase imported luxuries. The Stamp Act of 1765 resulted in a boycott on imported goods by many merchants, which was further strengthened by the passage of the Townshend Act of 1767.\nThese boycotts, however, were short-lived, to the dismay of more radical colonists who hoped to take control of superficial goods imported from Europe and imports from the West Indies. Once the Townshend Act was repealed, colonists flocked back to markets to purchase non-essentials.\n\nThe enforcement of the Tea Act of 1773 became a heated issue with the colonists, with the well-known demonstration at the Boston harbor, the Boston Tea Party, a direct reaction to the act. However, a much more important shift occurred in the colonists' drink of choice. In 1773, John Adams wrote a letter to his wife, Abigail, stating, \"Tea must be universally renounced and I must be weaned, and the sooner the better.\"\nThus began the American shift from tea to coffee. In a concentrated boycott, the housewives of Falmouth, Massachusetts publicly united, vowing to serve only coffee in their homes. This inspired other households throughout the colonies, both in the north and south, to do the same.\n\n## Effects of the American Revolution\nIn 1775, the Continental Congress decreed that no imports would enter the American colonies, nor would any exports move from America to Britain. Some historians state that this had a profound effect on the agriculture of America, while others state that there was no effect as the domestic market was strong enough to sustain American agriculturists. The dispute lies in the fact that the American economy was highly diverse; there was no standard form of currency, and records were not consistently kept.\n\nBy the declaration of the American Revolution, with George Washington as its military leader, dietary changes had already occurred in America.\nCoffee was quickly becoming the normal hot drink of the colonies and a taste for whiskey had been acquired among many of those who could produce it. In fact, in 1774, the first corn was grown in Kentucky specifically for production of American Bourbon whiskey. This step may have established this American spirit in American culture, just as the country was going to war with Britain.\nIn addition to whiskey coming into favor, a shift began in the consumption of cider over beer. Colonists opted to grow less barley as it was easier to ferment apple cider than to brew beer. Another reason for this change would have been the lack of imported hops needed to brew beer.\n\nAs the American colonies went to war, they needed soldiers and supplies in large quantities. Soldiers needed uniforms and, as all shipping into the colonies had ceased, wool became an integral commodity to the war effort. During the Revolution the consumption of mutton ceased almost entirely in many areas, and in Virginia it became illegal to consume except in cases of extreme necessity.\nGame had begun to become scarce in the region east of the Mississippi River. This could have been from over-hunting, or the game could have been driven westward as the colonial population increased. Irish and Scottish immigrants had been importing cattle into the American colonies during the early part of the 18th century. Consequently, when game was becoming scarce and mutton had a moratorium placed upon it, cattle were available to take their place as a protein source.\nThis change increased farmers' profit from animal husbandry. Small-scale cattle-raising began during the French-Indian War, but when the American Revolution came, farmers were able to increase their cattle holdings and increase the presence of beef in the American diet. In addition to beef production, the cattle also increased the production of milk and dairy products like butter. This may have contributed to the preference for butter over pork fat, especially in the northern colonies.\nWith the arrival of British Army to quell the revolution, and naval battles occurring on the seas, areas used for salt-water fishing became unsafe for fishermen, and thus lay dormant for much of the war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships.\nBefore the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the ocean waters. Once lobster-harvesting and cod-fishing were reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.\nWhere Americans had a historic disdain for the refineries of French cooking, that opinion, at least in a small part, began to change with the American alliance with the French.\nIn the first American publication of Hannah Glasse's Art of Cookery Made Easy, insults aimed at French dishes disappeared. Some Bostonians even attempted to cook French cuisine for their French allies, sometimes with comedic results when entire frogs were put into soups rather than just their legs. Nonetheless, the alliance supported a friendship with France that later resulted in a large migration of French cooks and chefs to America during the French Revolution.\nThe American diet was changed through this friendship as well as due to the changes forced through boycott and hostilities with Britain. After a time, trade resumed with the West Indies but was limited to necessities. Items that sustained the war effort in America were traded, with crops such as rice from the Carolinas shipped out and coffee beans imported in order to brew America's new beverage of choice.\n\n## See also\nCuisine of Antebellum America\nCuisine of the United States\nEarly modern European cuisine\nList of American foods\n\n## References\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

    "text": "# Curd rice\n\nCurd rice or yogurt rice is a dish originating from India. The word \"curd\" in Indian English refers to unsweetened plain yogurt. It is most popular in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh; and also in West Indian states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra.\n\n## Name\nDepending on region, this dish is referred to by several different local names: auliyā (ओलिया) in Rajasthan, ghens (ઘેંસ) in Gujarat, dahi bhāt (दही भात) in Maharashtra, tayir sādam/sōru (தயிர் சாதம்/சோறு), bagalabath (பகாலாபாத்) in Tamil Nadu, tayire chōr (തയിരെ ചോർ) in Kerala, perugannam/daddojanam (పెరుగన్నం/దద్దోజనం) in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, mosaranna (ಮೊಸರನ್ನ) in Karnataka, and dahi chunka bhāta/phenchā (ଦହି ଛୁଙ୍କ ଭାତ/ଫେଞ୍ଚା) in Odisha.\n\n## Preparation\nWhile combining steamed white rice and yogurt is the simplest way to make it, more complex techniques can be utilized when necessary. Rice is prepared either via steaming or pressure cooking to be soft as in the South Indian style. It is then allowed to cool to room temperature, after which it is seasoned with finely chopped green chillies, ginger, and curry leaves, and sometimes along with the tempering of black gram, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and asafoetida. Finally, curd and salt are added.\nAlternatively, it can be prepared by mashing cooked plain rice (mostly leftovers) with some salt, curd and (a little milk to lessen the sourness) garnishing it with fried urad dal, mustard seeds, green chilli and chopped coriander. Also, adding a few chopped onions in bigger slices will help the curd rice from fermenting too quickly.\nIn some areas, curd rice is served in a unique style where steamed rice is mixed with mild curd, salted and then tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves, dry chillies and black gram. Garnishing varies with region, and ranges from grated carrots, pomegranate seeds, raisins, green and purple grapes, fried cashews to grated raw mango and boondi. It can be served tepid or chilled. Additional options include a pinch of powdered and roasted asafoetida.\nVariations of the recipe are countless and are present in all states, reflecting the cuisine of each region. For example, in Karnataka, yogurt chillies (sandige menasu) are commonly added as part of the tempering. Regardless of this, the base components of rice, yogurt, tempered ingredients, and fresh ingredients are consistent, with the different ingredients included in each step varying.\n\n## Serving\nCurd rice is often eaten accompanied by South Asian pickles. In South Indian cuisine, curd rice is traditionally eaten at the end of lunch and dinner as this helps ease the effects of spicy food consumed prior. It is also said to aid digestion, as well as to balance the effects of the warm climate.\n\n## Occasions\nThe dish is both an everyday food and a food served on special occasions. It is a staple of traditional cuisine, with the untempered version present at the end of almost every Indian meal during summers. In Rajasthan and Gujarat, curd rice varieties auliya and ghens are prepared for the Shitala Saptami and Randhan Chhath festivals. The tempered version is often served during formal occasions and also offered as prasadam ('blessed food') to devotees in Hindu temples.\n\n## See also\n\nCuisine of India\nList of rice dishes\nRice congee\nSouth Indian cuisine\nUdupi cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

In Britain, curry is a popular dish with some types adopted from India, others modified or wholly invented, as with chicken tikka masala, likely created by British Indian restaurants in the 20th century.\n\n## Etymology\nThe English word \"curry\" is derived from the Dravidian language family, possibly by way of Dutch carrijl, Portuguese caris or caril, or some combination of these. The Dravidian source may be Tamil கறி kaṟi, (\"a spiced mixture with fish, meat or vegetable, eaten with boiled rice\"), or a mingled borrowing from multiple Dravidian languages. Other Dravidian languages, namely Malayalam (കറി kari, \"hot condiments; meats, vegetables\"), Middle Kannada, Kodava, and Telugu have similar words.\nKaṟi is described in a 17th-century Portuguese cookbook, based on trade with Tamil merchants along the Coromandel Coast of southeast India, becoming known as a \"spice blend... called kari podi or curry powder\". The first appearance in its anglicised form (spelt currey) was in Hannah Glasse's 1747 book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy.\nThe term \"curry\" is not derived from the name of the curry tree, although some curries do include curry leaves among many other spices. The cookery writer Pat Chapman noted the similarity of the words Karahi or Kadai, an Indian cooking dish shaped like a wok, without giving evidence. \"Curry\" is not related to the word cury in The Forme of Cury, a 1390s English cookbook; that term comes from the Middle French word cuire, meaning \"to cook\".\n\n## Cultural exchanges\n\n\n### Ancient spice trade in Asia\nBy 1500 BCE, seafaring merchants from Austronesian communities were already trading spices across the ocean. They sailed between South Asia and East Asia, especially the ports along southeastern India and Sri Lanka, creating some of the world's earliest maritime trade networks. Archaeological discoveries at Mohenjo-daro show that people were using mortar and pestle to grind spices as early as 2600 BCE. They pounded cumin, fennel, garlic, ginger, mustard, black peppercorns, saffron, sesame seed, tamarind pods, and turmeric to create spicy flavourings for their food, which included meat, fish, grains, pulses, and fruits. Black pepper is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE. The three basic ingredients of the spicy stew were ginger, garlic, and turmeric. Using starch grain analysis, archaeologists identified the residue of these spices in both skeletons and pottery shards from excavations in India, finding that turmeric and ginger were present, in what have been called \"proto-curries\". Sauces in India before Columbus could contain black pepper or long pepper to provide a little heat, but not chili, so they were not spicy hot by modern standards.\n\n### Medieval Indian proto-curries\nBefore Christopher Columbus, Indian dishes were sometimes spicy but they were never hot like many modern curries, as chili peppers were absent, along with tomatoes, potatoes, bell peppers and squashes. The proto-curries of medieval pre-Columbian India were diverse but not much like modern international curries. Sambar, for example, was a dish of pigeon peas (toor dal) or lentils, flavoured with onions and mild spices. Among the key spices used in the period was asafoetida (hīng), a foul-smelling gum from plants of the genus Ferula. Despite its smell, it adds a fine-tasting meaty flavour when it is fried in oil. \nChavundaraya II's 11th century Lokopakara makes use of asafoetida, cumin, curry tree leaves, and mustard to flavour a dal. \nSpices named in the 12th century Mānasollāsa from the Western Chalukya Empire of South India include coriander, cumin, asafoetida, salt, and black pepper.\nThe 15th century Ni'matnāmah Naṣir al-Dīn Shāhī from the Malwa Sultanate of Northern India describes flavouring vegetables with asafoetida and sesame seeds fried in ghee (clarified butter), with lime juice and salt.\n\n### Early modern trade\nThe establishment of the Mughal Empire, in the early 16th century, brought some new and subtly spiced dishes, especially in the north. The Indo-Persian Mughal cuisine of the emperor Akbar, as described in the Ain-i-Akbari, could cook aubergines (eggplants) with asafoetida, cardamom, cloves, coriander, ginger, lime juice, onions, and pepper. The cuisine established dishes like biryani in India, derived from Persian pilau rice and the Persian habit of marinading meat in yoghurt (curd), combined with Indian-style use of spices.\nAnother influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in Goa in 1510, resulting in the introduction of chili peppers, tomatoes and potatoes to India from the Americas, as a byproduct of the Columbian Exchange. The food culture scholar Lizzie Collingham suggests that the Portuguese in Goa (in West India) heard and adopted words adopted into a local  language from the Dravidian words from South India, becoming caril or carree as transcribed by British travellers of the time. This eventually led to the modern meaning of \"curry\" as a dish, often spiced, in a sauce or gravy. In 1598, an English translation of a Dutch book about travel in the East Indies mentioned a \"somewhat sour\" broth called Carriel, eaten with rice. The later Dutch word karie was used in the Dutch East Indies from the 19th century; many Indians had by then migrated to Southeast Asia.\n\n### British influence\nCurry was introduced to English cuisine from Anglo-Indian cooking in the 17th century, as spicy sauces were added to plain boiled and cooked meats. That cuisine was created in the British Raj when British wives or memsahibs instructed Indian cooks on the food they wanted, transforming many dishes in the process. Further, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when there were few British women in India, British men often lived with Indian mistresses, acquiring the local customs, language, and food. Curry was first served in coffee houses in Britain from 1809.\nIndian cooks in the 19th century prepared curries for their British masters simplified and adjusted to Anglo-Indian taste. For instance, a quarama from Lucknow contained (among other ingredients) ghee, yoghurt, cream, crushed almonds, cloves, cardamom, and saffron; whereas an 1869 Anglo-Indian quorema or korma, \"different in substance as well as name\", had no cream, almonds, or saffron, but it added the then-standard British curry spices, namely coriander, ginger, and black peppercorns. Curry, initially understood as \"an unfamiliar set of Indian stews and ragouts\", had become \"a dish in its own right, created for the British in India\". Collingham describes the resulting Anglo-Indian cuisine as \"eclectic\", \"pan-Indian\", \"lacking sophistication\", embodying a \"passion for garnishes\", and forming a \"coherent repertoire\"; but it was eaten only by the British. Collingham writes that \"The idea of a curry is, in fact, a concept that the Europeans imposed on India's food culture. Indians referred to their different dishes by specific names... But the British lumped all these together under the heading of curry.\"\nElsewhere in the 19th century, curry was carried to the Caribbean by Indian indentured workers in the British sugar industry.\n\n### Globalisation\nSince the mid-20th century, curries of many national styles have become popular far from their origins, and increasingly become part of international fusion cuisine. Alan Davidson writes that curry's worldwide extension is a result of the Indian diaspora and globalisation, starting within the British Empire, and followed by economic migrants who brought Indian cuisine to many countries. In 1886, 咖喱 (Gālí) (Chinese pronunciation of \"curry\") appeared among the Chinese in Singapore. Malay Chinese people then most likely brought curry to China.\nIn India, spices are always freshly prepared for use in curries. Derived from such mixtures (but not containing curry leaves), curry powder is a ready-prepared spice blend first sold by Indian merchants to European colonial traders. This was commercially available from the late 18th century, with brands such as Crosse & Blackwell and Sharwood's persisting to the present. Curry powder became a standard item in Anglo-Indian cuisine. British traders introduced the powder to Meiji-era Japan, in the mid-19th century, where it was used to make Japanese curry, known as カレー, karē.\n\n## Types\nThere are many varieties of curry. The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural traditions and personal preferences. Such dishes have names such as dopiaza and rogan josh that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk and spice pastes, and is commonly eaten over rice. Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. A masala mixture is a combination of dried or dry-roasted spices commonly homemade for some curries.\nDry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume purée, sautéed crushed onion, or tomato purée.\nCurry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain. Other commercial mixes include curry pastes and Japanese-style curry roux (in block or powder form).\n\n## By region\n\n\n### United Kingdom\nCurry is very popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town. It was estimated that in 2016 there were 12,000 curry houses, employing 100,000 people and with annual combined sales of approximately £4.2 billion. The food offered is cooked to British taste, but with increasing demand for authentic Indian styles. In 2001, chicken tikka masala was described by the British foreign secretary Robin Cook as \"a true British national dish, not only because it is the most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.\" Its origin is not certain, but many sources attribute it to British Indian restaurants in the 20th century.\nCurries in Britain are derived partly from India and partly from invention in local Indian restaurants. They vary from mildly-spiced to extremely hot, with names that are to an extent standardised across the country, but are often unknown in India. Zoe Perrett, writing for The Times of India, comments that anyone expecting traditional Indian cuisine from \"Brindian\" cuisine, a \"Bangla spin on Indian regional dishes, twisted still further to tempt British tastebuds\", will be disappointed. Variants like \"Kashmir\" and \"Malaya\" curry add fruits like banana, lychees, and pineapple. In short, the food might be, Perrett writes, \"not Indian at all.\" Inexpensive curry kits, containing a packet of whole spices, a packet of spice paste, and a pouch of sauce, are sold in British supermarkets, enabling a curry of \"exceptional\" quality to be cooked quickly at home.\n\n### South Asia\nSpicy Indian dishes were until the late 20th century not called \"curry\" by Indians: the term was initially limited to Anglo-Indian cuisine. Instead, numerous Indian dishes like dopiaza and rogan josh had their own names; the historian of food Colleen Sen notes that the Indian cook Madhur Jaffrey found the umbrella term 'curry' \"degrading to India's great cuisine\", but eventually accepted the category in her later writings. Both the names of the dishes and their methods of preparation are often regional.\nIndian curry sauces are made with spices including black pepper, cardamom, chili peppers, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, fennel seed, mustard seed, and turmeric. As many as 15 spices may be used for a meat curry. The spices are sometimes fried whole, sometimes roasted, sometimes ground and mixed into a paste. The sauces are eaten with steamed rice or idli rice cakes in south India, and breads such as chapatis, roti, and naan in the north. \nThe popular rogan josh, for example, from Kashmiri cuisine, is a wet dish of lamb with a red gravy coloured by Kashmiri chillies and an extract of the red flowers of the cockscomb plant (mawal). Rice and curry is the staple dish of Sri Lanka.\n\n### East Asia\nJapanese curry is usually eaten as karē raisu – curry, rice, and often pickled vegetables, served on the same plate and eaten with a spoon, a common lunchtime canteen dish. It is less spicy and seasoned than Indian and Southeast Asian curries, being more of a thick stew than a curry. British people brought curry from the Indian colony back to Britain and introduced it to Japan during the Meiji period (1868 to 1912), after Japan ended its policy of national self-isolation (sakoku), and curry in Japan was categorised as a Western dish. Its spread across the country is attributed to its use in the Japanese Army and Navy which adopted it extensively as convenient field and naval canteen cooking, allowing even conscripts from the remotest countryside to experience the dish. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force traditionally have curry every Friday for lunch and many ships have their own recipes. The standard Japanese curry contains onions, carrots, potatoes, and sometimes celery, and a meat that is cooked in a large pot. Sometimes grated apples or honey are added for additional sweetness and other vegetables are sometimes used instead.\nCurry spread to other regions of Asia. Curry powder is added to some dishes in the southern part of China. The curry powder sold in Chinese grocery stores is similar to Madras curry powder, but with the addition of star anise and cinnamon. The former Portuguese colony of Macau has its own culinary traditions and curry dishes, including Galinha à portuguesa (\"Portuguese-style chicken\") and curry crab. Portuguese sauce is a sauce flavoured with curry and thickened with coconut milk.\nCurry was popularized in Korean cuisine when Ottogi entered the Korean food industry with an imported curry powder in 1969. Korean curry powder contains spices including cardamom, chili, cinnamon, and turmeric.\nCurry tteokbokki is made of tteok (rice cakes), eomuk (fish cakes), eggs, vegetables, and gochujang, fermented red chili paste. As in India, chilis were brought to Korea by European traders. Spicy chili sauce then replaced the soy sauce formerly used in tteokbokki.\n\n### Southeast Asia\nIn Burmese cuisine, curries are broadly called hin. Burmese curries contains meat simmered in a curry paste containing onion, garlic, shrimp paste, tomato, and turmeric. Burmese curries are often mild, without chili, and somewhat oily.\nThai curries are called gaeng, and usually consist of meat, fish or vegetables in a sauce based on a paste made from chilies, onions or shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste. A few stir-fried Thai dishes use phong kari, an Indian style curry powder. In the West, Thai curries are often colour-coded green, yellow, and red, with green usually the mildest, red the hottest. Green curry is flavoured with green chili, coriander, kaffir lime, and basil; yellow, with yellow chili and turmeric; and red, with red chili.\nMalaysian Indian cuisine adapted curries (such as gulai, with coconut milk) via the region's Indian population, but it has become a staple among the Malay and Chinese populations there. Malaysian curries have many varieties, but are often flavoured with cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, coconut milk, shallots, chili peppers, and garlic.\nIndian Indonesian cuisine consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Indonesia. Curry in Indonesian is kari and in Javanese, kare. In Indonesian cuisine especially in Bandung, there is a dish called lontong kari, a combined of lontong and beef yellow curry soup. In Javanese cuisine, kare rajungan, blue swimmer crab curry has become a delicacy of Tuban Regency, East Java.\nIn Vietnamese cuisine, influenced by both Thai and Indian cooking, curry is known as cà ri.  Curry was brought to Vietnam by French colonisers, from their Indian outpost at Pondicherry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the south of the country in particular, the Vietnamese adopted Madras curry powder and coconut milk as the basis of dishes such as chicken lemongrass curry, cà ri gà.\nIn the Philippines, a dish that may have been directly inspired by Indian curries is the oxtail stew  kare-kare, possibly influenced by Sepoy expatriates during the brief British occupation of Manila (1762–1764), or indirectly via Southeast Asian spicy dishes. Ginataan are native dishes using coconut milk, which as in the case of Filipino chicken curry can be called 'curries' when curry powder is added.\n\n### South Africa\nCurry spread to South Africa with the migration of people from the Indian subcontinent to the region in the colonial era. African curries, Cape Malay curries and Natal curries include the traditional Natal curry, the Durban curry, bunny chow, and roti rolls. South African curries appear to have been created in both KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, while others developed across the country over the late 20th and early 21st centuries to include ekasi, coloured, and Afrikaner varieties. Durban has the largest population of Indians outside of India in the world. Bunny chow or a \"set\", a South African standard, consists of either lamb, chicken or bean curry poured into a tunnelled-out loaf of bread to be eaten with one's fingers by dipping pieces of the bread into it. 'Bunny chow' means 'Indian food', from Banian, an Indian. The method of serving the curry was created because apartheid forbade black people from eating in Indian restaurants; the loaves could speedily be taken away and eaten in the street.\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

In the 19th century, many more recipes appeared in the popular cookery books of the time. Curries in Britain are widely described with Indian terms, not necessarily used for the same dishes or even known in India. For example, korma is a mild sauce with almond and coconut; Madras has a hot, slightly sour sauce; phall denotes an extra hot sauce, and pasanda means a mild sauce with cream and coconut milk. One type of curry, chicken tikka masala, has become widespread enough to be described as a national dish.\nThe first curry house opened in London in 1810. More followed early in the 20th century; Veeraswamy, founded in 1926, is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain. By the 1970s, over three-quarters of the Indian restaurants in the country were owned and run by people of Bangladeshi origin, mainly from the Sylhet area. That has since changed, with more restaurants offering South Indian or Punjabi cuisines. Several cities acquired areas known for their many curry restaurants, including Birmingham's Balti Triangle, London's Brick Lane and Drummond Street, and Manchester's Curry Mile. By 2016, the number of curry houses reached a peak of some 12,000, declining to around 8,000 by 2023. Causes of the decline include a shortage of Indian cooks, and the availability of high quality curry sauces and ready-made meals in supermarkets.\n\n## Context\n\n\n### Anglo-Indian cuisine\nDuring the British presence in India, between 1612 and 1947, cooks began adapting Indian dishes for British palates to create Anglo-Indian cuisine. Anglo-Indian cooks created their version of \"curry\" by selecting elements of Indian dishes from all over British India. The historian of food Lizzie Collingham describes their taste as \"eclectic\", \"pan-Indian\", \"lacking sophistication\",  and forming a \"coherent repertoire\". She notes especially their \"passion for garnishes\", which they borrowed from multiple traditions: chopped hard-boiled eggs from Persian cuisine; lemon pickles from Punjab; pappadoms, dried coconut, and raw onions from South India; and their own additions like pieces of fried bacon. The cuisine soon began to appear in Britain as Anglo-Indians returned home.\nIn her 1895 book Anglo-Indian Cooking at Home, Henrietta Hervey described how to make three curry powders, which she called \"Madras\", \"Bombay\", and \"Bengal\". The \"Madras\" powder recipe called for coriander, saffron, chilli, mustard seed, pepper, and cumin, among other ingredients. The \"Bombay\" recipe used coriander, cumin, turmeric, mustard seed, pepper, chillies, and a little fenugreek. The \"Bengal\" mixture consisted mainly of coriander, turmeric, fenugreek, ginger, black pepper, and chilli. For cooks in England, Hervey suggested the commercial Crosse & Blackwell mixture, which she called \"the nearest approach to the real article\", but \"a pis aller [a desperate measure] at the best\". Hervey's recipe for an Anglo-Indian favourite for a British audience, \"Country Captain\" chicken curry, consisted of a chicken cut into joints, dusted with curry powder, and fried with onions.\n\n### Becoming part of English cooking\nThe first curry recipe in Britain was published in The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse in 1747. The first edition of her book used only black pepper and coriander seeds for seasoning of \"currey\". The cookery writer Clarissa Dickson Wright calls Glasse's curry a \"famous recipe\" and comments that she was \"a bit sceptical\" of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was \"pleasantly surprised by the end result\" which had \"a very good and interesting flavour\". Later editions added cream, lemons, and spices such as ginger and turmeric.\nLondon eating places such as coffee houses began to add curry to their repertoires in 1773, with the arrival of Indian Lascar shipping crews, including their cooks, at London's East India Docks. The first commercially available curry powder in England was advertised by Sorlie's Perfumery Warehouse on Piccadilly in 1784.\n\nMany curry recipes appeared in 19th century cookery books. Eliza Acton's 1845 Modern Cookery for Private Families offered recipes for curried sweetbreads and curried macaroni, merging Indian and European foods into standard English cooking. Her recipe for curry powder consisted of turmeric, coriander, cumin, fenugreek, and cayenne; she recommended Corbyn's of High Holborn as a source of spices. The 1861 edition of Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management gave a recipe for curry powder containing coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cayenne, mustard, ginger, allspice and fenugreek; although she notes that it is more economical to purchase the powder at \"any respectable shop\". By 1895, curry was included in Dainty Dishes for Slender Incomes, aimed at the poorer classes.\n\n### Popular dish\nBy the start of the 21st century, curry was extremely popular in the United Kingdom, with a curry house in nearly every town. In 2016 there were some 12,000 curry houses in the United Kingdom, employing 100,000 people with annual combined sales of approximately £4.2 billion. This had declined to some 8,000 restaurants by 2023, partly because it was difficult to find Indian cooks, but the easy availability of curry sauces in supermarkets, and of ready-made meals, likely contributed to the decline.\nHouseholders can order takeaways from restaurants to eat at home. Alternatively, they can buy inexpensive curry kits, containing a packet of whole spices, a packet of spice paste, and a pouch of sauce, from a supermarket, enabling them to prepare a curry of \"exceptional\" quality quickly at home. \"The Spice Tailor\" for example started to produce its curry kits in 2010.\nCurry has become an integral part of British cuisine, so much so that, by the start of the 21st century, the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called chicken tikka masala \"a true British national dish\" in a speech to parliament. The sociologist Bob Ashley remarked in 2004 that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed \"We're not allowed to do foreign food ... I can't do lasagne or anything like that\", in fact served curry, because \"seemingly curry is English\". In a survey in 2011, jalfrezi was rated the most popular dish in British Indian restaurants, having taken over from chicken tikka masala.\n\n### Accompaniments\nCurry is accompanied by side dishes such as Indian flatbreads including naan, fried snacks such as bhajis, pakoras, and samosas used as starters, plain or spiced rice, dal, a selection of chutneys, and cooling raitas.\nCollingham remarks that \"another very British practice\" is to drink beer with a curry. She notes that as early as 1810, Thomas Williamson wrote in The East India vade-mecum that \"nothing can be more gratifying ... after eating curry\" than a glass of beer. In the mid-20th century, people would buy a curry after leaving the pub of an evening. Bangladeshi restaurant owners were often reluctant to sell alcohol, believing that to be against their Muslim faith. Once Indian restaurants had acquired licences to sell alcohol, Collingham comments, \"a few beers, a hot vindaloo and chips\" became a popular combination. A study gave the practice some prominence by purporting to link the consumption of curry spices with increased alcohol absorption and a reduced risk of stomach ulcers when the two were consumed together.\n\n## Curry houses\n\n\n### 19th century\nIn 1810, the entrepreneur Dean Mahomed, from the Bengal Presidency, opened the first Indian curry house in England: the Hindoostane Dinner and Hooka Smoking Club, later called the Hindoostane Coffee House, in London's Portman Square. Dishes could be purchased there for consumption at home, making it in addition England's first takeaway restaurant. It closed in 1833.\n\n### Early 20th century\nIn 1911, the Salut-e-Hind restaurant opened in London's Holborn district. Another early Indian restaurant was the Shafi on London's Gerrard Street, founded in 1920; it became a meeting-place for Indians in Britain, including students and visiting politicians such as Muhammad Ali Jinnah alongside English returnees from India. In the 1920s, the Bahadur brothers opened the Kohinoor restaurant on London's Roper Street; it flourished, enabling the brothers to open further restaurants in Brighton, Cambridge, Manchester, Northampton, and Oxford in the 1920s and 1930s.\nVeeraswamy & Co. had been selling Nizam brand Indian foods across England since 1896. \nThe Veeraswamy restaurant in London's Regent Street was founded in 1926; it is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain. These pre-war restaurants served Anglo-Indian cuisine using curry powder, without the variety of spicing characteristic of Indian cuisine.\n\n### Post-war\nFor Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953, the florist Constance Spry and the cookery instructor Rosemary Hume invented a curried chicken salad which they called coronation chicken. It called for pan-roasted chicken to be combined with a sauce using Madras curry powder  and mayonnaise.\nIn 1961, the British company Batchelors launched Vesta instant dried curry, a product that enabled people to make a quick curry at home. It became well-known, even aspirational. The product was heavily advertised through to the 1980s as a tasty full meal that could be ready in 20 minutes. The resulting curry was later described in The Guardian as \"suspiciously shiny brown goo\". In 1982, the humorous novelist Sue Townsend made her schoolboy character Adrian Mole eat Vesta, only to be mocked for it by an Indian neighbour.\nDesi pubs, managed by a landlord of Indian origin and serving Indian food including curries, originated during the 1960s. They have been cited as examples of cultural integration between Asian and British communities. By 2016, there were at least 50 Desi pubs in the Black Country of the West Midlands alone.\nUntil the early 1970s, more than three-quarters of Indian restaurants in Britain were owned and run by migrants from East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971. British Bangladeshi restaurateurs overwhelmingly came from the northeastern division of Sylhet. The restaurants in towns all across Britain were \"almost invariably\" decorated with red flock wallpaper, not to mention what Curry Magazine described as \"ornamental hardboard Indian arches, and red or orange lighting in Eastern lampshades\". While their decor was mocked by critics, the food was widely enjoyed, being at once familiar and exotic. As late as 1998, as many as 85% of curry restaurants in the United Kingdom were British Bangladeshi, but by 2003 this figure had declined to just over 65%.\n\nIn the 1980s, Bradford, in economic decline with the loss of its textile industry, started to advertise itself with a \"curry trail\" in \"Flavours of Asia\" brochures; it had over 50 curry houses at that time, rising to more than 200 by 2008. In 1982, the BBC published a practical guide to cooking curries by the Indian cook Madhur Jaffrey; at that time, she avoided the word \"curry\", feeling that the umbrella term for many different dishes and regional styles was \"degrading to India's great cuisine\", but she eventually accepted the category in her later writings.\nIn Birmingham, the \"Balti Triangle\" near Balsall Heath and Sparkhill was home to over 30 Balti curry houses at the start of the 21st century, but by 2023 this had declined to just 4, while dessert shops and takeaways had increased. Adil's restaurant there, founded in 1977, and which may have invented the Balti curry, closed in 2022 when its founder retired.\n\nBrick Lane, in London's East End became famous for its many Bangladeshi cuisine curry houses, with a curry festival that was for a while run annually. The area became known as 'Banglatown', but the restaurants and Bangladeshi shops declined sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### 21st century\nThe dominance of Bangladeshi restaurants is generally declining both in London and across Britain. In Glasgow, there are more restaurants of Punjabi origin than any other. One of the oldest, Shish Mahal restaurant on Glasgow's Park Road, claims to have invented chicken tikka masala in 1972.\n\nDrummond Street, near London's Euston Station, houses many South Indian restaurants with a quite different cuisine from the Bangladeshi. The oldest, the Diwana Bhel Poori House, was founded in 1971, and may well be Britain's oldest South Indian vegetarian restaurant.\nIn the early 2010s the popularity of the curry house saw a decline. This has been attributed to the sale of curries in generic restaurants, increased home cooking of curries with ingredients readily available in supermarkets, and Britain's 2008 immigration restrictions making it hard to find low-wage chefs. As of 2015, curry houses accounted for a fifth of the restaurant business in the United Kingdom. Restaurant styles too are changing; for example, since 2014, Bundobust has opened vegetarian Gujarati street food restaurants in several cities.\n\nIn 2014, Manchester's Curry Mile on Wilmslow Road in its Rusholme district housed over 70 Indian restaurants, the largest number in any district in the country. Cuisines available on the street by 2020 included North Indian, Pakistani (Lahori, Mughlai), Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi, and Nepalese.\nThe cities of Birmingham, Bradford, Glasgow, Leicester, and West London have each spent a year in the 21st century as \"England's Curry Capital\" after a national vote.\nRegardless of the ethnic origin of a restaurant's ownership, the menu is influenced by wider South Asian cuisine, and sometimes cuisines from further afield, such as Persian dishes. Better quality restaurants make up new sauces on a daily basis, using fresh ingredients wherever possible and grinding their own spices. More modest establishments may resort to frozen or dried ingredients and pre-packaged spice mixtures. At the top end, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars for the quality of their cooking in 2001.\nIn Wales, St Helen's Road, Swansea has been home to multiple curry houses since 1970, following the arrival of Bangladeshi immigrants from the 1950s onwards.\nIn Northern Ireland, two restaurants in the centre of Derry, the Mekong with its Vietnamese/Thai cuisine and the Siam Thai with its Thai cuisine, have both been placed in the Asian Catering Federation's list of the UK's \"Top 100 Curry Restaurants\".\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Range of strengths\nCurries in Britain are derived and named partly from India and partly from invention in local Indian restaurants. They vary from mildly-spiced to extremely hot, with names that are often unknown in India.\n\n### Named types\nThere are many named types of curry in British Indian restaurants. These include:\n\n## See also\nThe British Curry Awards\nThe Curry Club\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nAshley, Bob (2004). Food and Cultural Studies. Psychology Press.

    "text": "# Curry tree\n\nBergera koenigii, commonly known as curry tree, curry bush or sweet neem, is a tree in the citrus family Rutaceae, first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1767. It is native to the Indian subcontinent, southern China and mainland Southeast Asia, and it has been introduced to other parts of southeast Asia and to Australia. Its leaves are used in many culinary dishes in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\n\n## Description\nIt is a small tree, growing 4–6 metres (13–20 ft) tall, with a trunk up to 40 cm (16 in) in diameter. The aromatic leaves are pinnate, with 11–21 leaflets, each leaflet 2–4 cm (3⁄4–1+1⁄2 in) long and 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) broad. The plant produces small white flowers which can self-pollinate to produce small shiny-black drupes containing a single, large viable seed. The berry pulp is edible, with a sweet flavor.\n\n## Distribution and habitat\nThe tree is native to the following areas:\n\nIndian subcontinent: Assam,  Bangladesh, East Himalaya, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Himalaya\nChina: China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan\nIndo-China: Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam\nIt has been introduced to the Andaman Islands, Christmas Island, Fiji, Java, the Laccadive Islands, the Maldives, the Nicobar Islands and Sumatra. It has also been introduced to Queensland, Australia, where it is classed as an environmental weed.\nCommercial plantations have been established in India, Australia and Costa del Sol in Spain.\n\n## Cultivation\nIt grows best in well-drained soil that does not dry out, in areas with full sun or partial shade, preferably away from the wind. Growth is more robust when temperatures are at least 18 °C (64 °F).\n\n## Etymology and common names\nThe word 'curry' is borrowed from the Tamil word kari ('spiced sauce' or 'meat'). The name of the plant in Tamil is also sometimes associated with the perceived blackness of the tree's leaves ('karuveppilai', meaning dark leaves), though the English word curry stems from its use in spiced dishes. The records of the leaves being utilized are found in Tamil literature dating back to the 1st and 4th centuries CE. Britain had spice trades with the ancient Tamil region. It was introduced to England in the late 16th century..\nThe species Bergera koenigii was first published by Carl Linnaeus in Mantissa Plantarum vol.2 on page 563 in 1767.\nIt was formerly known as Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng., which was first published in Syst. Veg., ed. 16. 2: 315 in 1825. Some sources still recognise it as the accepted name.\nThe former generic name, Murraya, derives from Johan Andreas Murray (1740–1791), who studied botany under Carl Linnaeus and became a professor of medicine with an interest in medicinal plants at the University of Göttingen, Germany. The specific name, koenigii, derives from the last name of botanist Johann Gerhard König.\nThe curry tree is also called curry leaf tree or curry bush, among numerous local names, depending on the country.\nIt is known by a variety of names in the Indian subcontinent and South Asia itself. Some of its alternative names are:\n\nHindi: करी/करीयापत्ता का पेड़ (kari/kariyāpattā ka peṛ)\nPunjabi: ਕਡੀ/ਕੜੀ ਪੱਤੀ ਦਾ ਰੁਖ (kaḍi/kaṛi patti dā rukh)\nGujarati: મીઠો લીંબડો નુ બૃક્ષ/ઝાડ (miṭho limbḍo nu bruksh/jhāḍ)\nMarathi: कढीपानाचे/कढीलिंबाचे झाड (kaḍhīpānache /kaḍhīlimbāche jhāḍ)\nBengali: করীফুুলীর/কারীপাতার গাছ (kariphulir /kāripātār gāchh)\nOdia: ଭୃଷଙ୍ଗର/ଭୃଷମର ଗଛ (bhrusungara/bhrusamara gachha)\nAssamese: নৰসিংহৰ গছ (narahingor gos)\nNepali: करीपात को रूख (karipāt ko rūkh)\nMeitei: ꯀꯔꯤ ꯄꯥꯝꯕꯤ (kari pambi)\nKannada: ಕರಿಬೇವಿನ ಮರ (karibēvina mara)\nTamil: கறிவேப்பிலை மரம் (karivēppilai maram)\nTelugu: కరివేపాకు చెట్టు (karivēpāku cheṭṭu)\nMalayalam: കറിവേപ്പ് (karivēppu)\nTulu: ಬೇವುಡಿರೇ ಮರ (bēvudirae mara)\nSinhala: කරපිංච ගස (karapincha gasa)\nBurmese:ဟင်းရွက်သစ်ပင် (hainnrwat saitpain)\n\n## Uses\n\n\n### Culinary\nCurry leaves have a \"mild, aromatic, slightly bitter\" flavor.\nThe fresh leaves are an indispensable part of Indian cuisine and Indian traditional medicines. They are most widely used in southern and west coast Indian cooking, usually fried along with vegetable oil, mustard seeds and chopped onions in the first stage of the preparation. They are also used to make thoran, vada, rasam, and kadhi; additionally, they are often dry-roasted (and then ground) in the preparation of various powdered spice blends (masalas), such as South Indian sambar masala, the main seasoning in the ubiquitous vegetable stew sambar. The curry leaves are also added as flavoring to masala dosa, the South Indian potato-filled dosas, made with a mildly probiotic, fermented lentil and rice batter. The fresh leaves are valued as seasoning in the cuisines of South and Southeast Asia. In Cambodia, curry leaves (Khmer: ស្លឹកកន្ទ្រោប, slœ̆k kontroap) are roasted and used as an ingredient for samlor machu kroeung. In Java, the leaves are often stewed to flavor gulai. Though available dried, the aroma and flavor are greatly inferior. In almost all cases, the leaves will be freshly plucked from a garden only a few hours or even minutes before they are used. The oil can be extracted and used to make scented soaps.\nThe leaves of Murraya koenigii are also used as a herb in Ayurvedic and Siddha medicine in which they are believed to possess anti-disease properties, but there is no high-quality clinical evidence for such effects.\nThe berries are edible, but the seeds may be toxic to humans.\n\n## Propagation\nSeeds must be ripe and fresh to plant; dried or shriveled fruits are not viable. The skin must be peeled off, and this is recommended before planting. One can plant the whole fruit, but it is best to remove the pulp before planting in a potting mix that is kept moist but not wet. Stem cuttings can be also used for propagation. In the Indian subcontinent, the plant is a fixture in almost every household. It is mainly planted privately, but also cultivated commercially to a small extent. Because the leaves must be fresh upon use, it is often traded through a small neighborhood or city wide network of farmers, who regularly supply fresh leaves to stall vendors.\n\n## Chemical constituents\nCompounds found in curry tree leaves, stems, bark, and seeds include cinnamaldehyde, and numerous carbazole alkaloids, including mahanimbine, girinimbine, and mahanine.\nMajor odor compounds contained in the leaves are the sulfury-smelling 1-phenylethanethiol, the citrusy-smelling linalool, the resinous-smelling α-pinene, eucalyptol, the grassy-smelling cis-3-hexenal, methional, myrcene, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and trans,cis-2,6-nonadienal.\nNutritionally, the leaves are a rich source of carotenoids, beta-carotene, calcium and iron.\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Murraya koenigii at Wikimedia Commons",

These pulses are among the leading  staple foods in South Asian countries, and form an important part of the cuisines of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n## Etymology\nThe word dāl (dal) derives from the Sanskrit verbal root dal- \"to split\", which is inherited from Proto-Indo-European *delh₁- \"to split, divide\".\n\n## History\nLentils are among the most ancient cultivated foods; they have been found in human settlements dating back to the Bronze Age. Researchers have dated the preparation and cooking of split dal as far back as 800–300 BC.\nDal as a staple food has been mentioned in many ancient religious texts, including the Yajurveda and the Mahayana Buddhist Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra.\n\nMay for me strength, righteousness, milk, sap, ghee, honey, eating and drinking in company, ploughing, rain, conquest, victory, wealth, riches, prosperity, prospering, plenteousness, lordship, much, more, fun, fuller, imperishableness, bad crops, food, freedom from hunger, rice, barley, beans, sesame, kidney beans, vetches, wheat, lentils, millet, Panicum miliaceum, Panicum frumentaceum, and wild rice (prosper through the sacrifice).\nNow, Mahāmati, the food I have permitted [my disciples to take] is gratifying to all wise people but is avoided by the unwise; it is productive of many merits, it keeps away many evils; and it has been prescribed by the ancient Rishis. It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, etc., [...] food prepared with these is proper food.\n\n## Use\nDal are often prepared in three different forms:\n\nUnhulled and whole, known as sabut ('whole' in Hindi), such as sabut urad dal or mung sabut;\nUnhulled and split, known as chilka ('shell' in Hindi), such as chilka urad dal or mung dal chilka;\nHulled and split, known as dhuli ('washed' in Hindi), e.g. urad dhuli, or mung dhuli.\nThe hulling of a pulse is intended to improve digestibility and palatability. It also affects the nutrition provided by the dish, significantly increasing protein and reducing dietary fibre content. Pulses with their outer hulls intact are also quite popular in the Indian subcontinent as the main cuisine. Over 50 different varieties of pulses are known in the Indian subcontinent.\nDal is frequently eaten with flatbreads, such as rotis or chapatis, or with rice. The latter combination is called dal bhat in Nepali, Gujarati, and various other Indian languages. In addition, certain types of dal are fried, salted, and eaten as a dry snack, and a variety of savory snacks are made by frying a paste made from soaked and ground dals in different combinations, to which other ingredients, such as spices and nuts (commonly cashews) may be added.\nDal preparations are eaten with rice, chapati and naan on the Indian subcontinent. The manner in which it is cooked and presented varies by region. In South India, dal is often called \"paruppu\". It is primarily used to make a dish called sambar. It is also used to make parippu that is mixed with charu and rice. Ground chana dal is used to make a paste called besan, which is used in the preparation of many dishes including bhaji and Mediterranean dishes like farinata.\n\n## Preparation\nMost dal recipes are quite simple to prepare. The standard preparation begins with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some turmeric, salt to taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process. In some recipes, tomatoes, kokum, unripe mango, jaggery, or other ingredients are added while cooking the dal, often to impart a sweet-sour flavour.\nThe fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including chaunk, tadka/tarka, bagar, fodni, and phoran. The ingredients in the chaunk for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and sometimes fenugreek seeds and dried red chili pepper) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by ginger, garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, ground spices (turmeric, coriander, red chili powder, garam masala, etc.) are added. The chaunk is then poured over the cooked dal.\n\n## Nutrition\nAs the main ingredient of dal is the pulse used, it gains much of its nutritional properties from the pulse.\n\nNote: All nutrient values including protein are in %DV per 100 grams of the food item. Significant values are highlighted in light gray color and bold letters.\nCooking reduction = % Maximum typical reduction in nutrients due to boiling without draining for ovo-lacto-vegetables group.\n\n## Common ingredients\nPigeon pea, i.e., yellow pigeon pea, is available either plain or oily. It is called toor dal in Hindi. It is called thuvaram paruppu in Tamil Nadu, thuvara parippu in Kerala and is the main ingredient for the dish sambar. In Karnataka, it is called togari bele and is an important ingredient in bisi bele bath. It is called kandi pappu in Telugu and is used in the preparation of a staple dish pappu charu. It is also known as arhar dal in northern India.\nChana dal is produced by removing the outer layer of black chickpeas and then splitting the kernel. Although machines can do this, it can be done at home by soaking the whole chickpeas and removing the loose skins by rubbing.  In Karnataka it is called kadle bele. Other varieties of chickpea may be used, e.g., kabuli dal.\nYellow split peas are very prevalent in the Indian communities of Guyana, Fiji, Suriname, Jamaica, South Africa, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, and are popular amongst Indians in the United States as well as India. There, it is referred to generically as dal and is the most popular dal. It is prepared similarly to dals found in India, but may be used in recipes. The whole dried pea is called matar or matar dal in India. The whole dried yellow pea is the main ingredient in the common Bengali street food ghugni.\nSplit mung beans (mung dal) is by far the most popular in Bangladesh and West Bengal (moog dal, (মুগ ডাল)). It is used in parts of South India, such as in the Tamil dish ven pongal. Roasted and lightly salted or spiced mung bean is a popular snack in most parts of India.\nUrad dal, sometimes referred to as \"black gram\", is a primary ingredient of the south Indian dishes idli and dosa. It is one of the main ingredients of East Indian (Odia and Bengali or Assamese) bori, sun-dried dumplings. The Punjabi version is dal makhani. It is called uddina bele in Karnataka, biulir dal in Bengali. It is rich in protein.\nMasoor dal: split red lentils. In Karnataka, it is called kempu (red) togari bele.\nRajma dal: split kidney beans.\nMussyang is made from dals of various colours found in various hilly regions of Nepal.\nPanchratna dal (Hindi) (\"five jewels\") is a mixture of five varieties of dal, which produces a dish with a unique flavour.\nNavrangi dal is a lesser known Dal variety from Himachal Pradesh. It is mostly cultivated in Himachal and is multicoloured.\nMoth bean: is an Indian dal main ingredient for popular Indian snack bikaneri bhujia and Maharashtrian snacks misal and usal.\nPulses may be split but not hulled; they are distinguished from hulled dals by adding the word chilka (skin).\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nDal bhat\nDal bati churma\nDal biji\nEzogelin soup\nFasole bătută\nLentil soup\nMonggo (Philippine version of dal)\nPea soup\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nSalma Husain; Vijay Thukral (2018).

It is associated with the festivals of Makar Sankranti and Diwali in the Dhundhad region. It is also prepared on special occasions like marriage ceremonies and housewarming.\nDal baati is eaten with churma popularly in regions of Rajasthan and Haryana. Churma is a sweet dish made of coarsely grounded wheat flour, bajra (millet) flour, or semolina. It is made by grinding the fire-baked or fried dough balls and mixing them with ghee, powdered sugar or jaggery and dry fruits.\n\n## History\nInformation regarding the origins of the dish is scarce: however, it has long been a part of cuisines from the western region of India, i.e., Rajasthan, Haryana, and parts of Gujarat.\nBaati made of unsalted wheat, ghee and camel milk was first mentioned during the time of Bappa Rawal—the founder of the kingdom of Mewar in Rajasthan. They were known as a nomadic warrior tribe before they settled into the tapestry of a kingdom and got Chittor in form of dowry from Maan Mori, Baati was the Guhilot's official wartime meal.\nBaati, a traditional dish, is said to have originated with soldiers who would break the dough into chunks and bury them under thin layers of sand to bake under the sun. According to anecdotal accounts, upon their return, soldiers would find perfectly baked roundels, which were then dunked in ghee. On occasion, curd or buttermilk might also have been added. Initially, Baati was paired with ghee and curd, but over time, Dal and Choorma became additional components of the meal. \nSome anthropologists suggest that at a grassroots level, Baati was still commonly paired with ghee and buttermilk or curd made from camel or goat milk, while the combination of Dal and Baati was more common among the upper caste. This shift may have been influenced by the presence of traders in Mewar or by culinary practices from the Gupta period, during which Panchmael Dal was considered a delicacy. These connections are largely speculative, and the extent of their historical accuracy remains uncertain.\nThe inclusion of Choorma, now regarded as an integral part of the meal, is often attributed to the House of Mewar. Folklore holds that Choorma was discovered when a cook accidentally poured sugarcane juice into the Baati during wartime. Other stories suggest that homemakers soaked the Baatis in sugar or jaggery water to preserve them for their husbands, which eventually evolved into Choorma. These origins are also anecdotal, and there is no definitive evidence to confirm the precise development of Choorma or its association with Dal Baati.\n\n## Dal bafla\nDal bafla (Hindi: दाल बाफ़्ला) is a variation of Dal Baati, where the normal Bafla is boiled before baking it in a traditional Baati oven. Baati is replaced by the bafla, a softer version of it. It is native to the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh. Although, parts of Rajasthan have been consuming Bafla and claim it to be native to their regions.\n\n## See also\nKatt bafla\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Dal baati at Wikimedia Commons",

A relatively modern variation of traditional lentil dishes, it is made with urad dal (black beans) and other pulses, and includes butter and cream (makhani is a Punjabi word for butter).\n\n## Etymology\nDal means lentils or pulses. Makhan is the Punjabi word for butter. Makhani means buttery.\n\n## History\nKundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral were both Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar, who had already invented the butter chicken in the Moti Mahal restaurant, in the Daryaganj neighborhood of Old Delhi, during the early 1950s, after the Partition of India. They were now looking to create a vegetarian dish that would complement it.\nA regular diner at the restaurant that Jaggi and Gujral ran suggested that something exciting could be created out of urad dal commonly used in traditional dishes, leading to the invention of dal makhani.\n\n## Preparation\nDal makhani is traditionally prepared by first soaking urad dal and red kidney beans (rajma) overnight. The soaked lentils and beans are then boiled or pressure-cooked until tender.\nSeparately, a tadka (tempered oil mixture) is prepared by heating ghee in a pot, then adding onions, a bay leaf, and an optional cardamom pod. The onions are sautéed until golden brown, and ginger-garlic paste is added until the raw aroma dissipates. Tomato puree, Kashmiri chili powder, and garam masala are stirred into the mixture and cooked until the oil separates.\nThe boiled lentils and beans are then combined with the masala and simmered on low heat, occasionally mashing some of the lentils to achieve a creamy texture. Kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and butter are added toward the end, and the dish is cooked until thick and creamy.\nDal makhani is typically garnished with a small amount of cream or yogurt and chopped coriander. It is commonly served with jeera rice (cumin-flavored rice) or naan.\n\n## See also\n\nList of legume dishes\nPunjabi cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Dalit\n\nDalit (English: /ˈdælɪt/, Hindi: [d̪əlɪt̪] from Sanskrit: दलित meaning \"broken/scattered\"), also called Harijans (Hindi: [ɦəɾɪdʒən]) is a term used for untouchables and outcasts, who represent the lowest stratum of the castes in the Indian subcontinent.

The constitution of India includes Dalits as one of the Scheduled Castes; this gives Dalits the right to protection, affirmative action (known as reservation in India), and official development resources.\n\n## Terminology\nThe term Dalit is for those called the \"untouchables\" and others that were outside of the traditional Hindu caste hierarchy. Economist and reformer B. R. Ambedkar (1891–1956) said that untouchability came into Indian society around 400 CE, due to the struggle for supremacy between Buddhism and Brahmanism. Some Hindu priests befriended untouchables and were demoted to low-caste ranks. Eknath, who was an excommunicated Brahmin, fought for the rights of untouchables during the Bhakti period.\nIn the late 1880s, the Marathi word 'Dalit' was used by Jyotirao Phule for the outcasts and untouchables who were oppressed and broken in the Hindu society. Dalit is a vernacular form of the Sanskrit दलित (dalita). In Classical Sanskrit, this means \"divided, split, broken, scattered\". This word was repurposed in 19th-century Sanskrit to mean \"(a person) not belonging to one of the four Varnas\". It was perhaps first used in this sense by Pune-based social reformer Jyotirao Phule, in the context of the oppression faced by the erstwhile \"untouchable\" castes from other Hindus. The term Dalits was in use as a translation for the Indian census classification of Depressed Classes prior to 1935. It was popularised by Ambedkar, himself a Dalit, who included all depressed people irrespective of their caste into the definition of Dalits. It covered people who were excluded from the fourfold varna system of Hinduism and thought of themselves as forming a fifth varna, describing themselves as Panchama. In the 1970s its use was invigorated when it was adopted by the Dalit Panthers activist group.\nSocio-legal scholar Oliver Mendelsohn and political economist Marika Vicziany wrote in 1998 that the term had become \"intensely political ... While the use of the term might seem to express appropriate solidarity with the contemporary face of Untouchable politics, there remain major problems in adopting it as a generic term. Although the word is now quite widespread, it still has deep roots in a tradition of political radicalism inspired by the figure of B. R. Ambedkar.\" They went on to suggest that its use risked erroneously labelling the entire population of untouchables in India as being united by a radical politics. Anand Teltumbde also detects a trend towards denial of the politicised identity, for example among educated middle-class people who have converted to Buddhism and argue that, as Buddhists, they cannot be Dalits. This may be due to their improved circumstances giving rise to a desire not to be associated with what they perceive to be the demeaning Dalit masses.\nJames Lochtefeld, a professor of religion and Asian studies, said in 2002 that the \"adoption and popularization of [the term Dalit] reflects their growing awareness of the situation, and their greater assertiveness in demanding their legal and constitutional rights\".\n\n### Other terms\n\n\n## History\nGopal Baba Walangkar (c. 1840–1900) is generally considered to be the pioneer of the Dalit movement, seeking a society in which they were not discriminated against. Another pioneer was Harichand Thakur (c. 1812–1878) with his Matua organisation that involved the Namasudra (Chandala) community in the Bengal Presidency. Ambedkar himself believed Walangkar to be the progenitor. Another early social reformer who worked to improve conditions for Dalits was Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890).\nThe present system has its origins in the 1932 Poona Pact between Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi, when Ambedkar conceded his demand that the Dalits should have an electorate separate from the caste Hindus in return for Gandhi accepting measures along these lines. The notion of a separate electorate had been proposed in the Communal Award made by the British Raj authorities, and the outcome of the Pact – the Government of India Act 1935 – introduced the new term of Scheduled Castes, as a replacement for the term Depressed Classes, and also reserved seats for them in the legislatures.\nSoon after its independence in 1947, India introduced a reservation system to enhance the ability of Dalits to have political representation and to obtain government jobs and education. The 1950 Constitution of India included measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of Dalits. Aside from banning untouchability, these included the reservation system, a means of positive discrimination that created the classification of Scheduled Castes as Dalits. Communities that were categorised as being one of those groups were guaranteed a percentage of the seats in the national and state legislatures, as well as in government jobs and places of education.\nBy 1995, of all federal government jobs in India – 10.1 per cent of Class I, 12.7 per cent of Class II, 16.2 per cent of Class III, and 27.2 per cent of Class IV jobs were held by Dalits. Of the most senior jobs in government agencies and government-controlled enterprises, only 1 per cent were held by Dalits, not much change in 40 years. In the 21st century, Dalits have been elected to India's highest judicial and political offices. In 1997, India elected its first Dalit President, K. R. Narayanan. Many social organisations have promoted better conditions for Dalits through education, healthcare and employment. Nonetheless, while caste-based discrimination was prohibited and untouchability abolished by the Constitution of India, such practices are still widespread. To prevent harassment, assault, discrimination and similar acts against these groups, the Government of India enacted the Prevention of Atrocities Act, also called the SC/ST Act, on 31 March 1995.\nIn accordance with the order of the Bombay High Court, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry (I&B Ministry) of the Government of India issued an advisory to all media channels in September 2018, asking them to use \"Scheduled Castes\" instead of the word \"Dalit\".\n\n## Demographics\nScheduled Caste communities exist across India and comprised 16.6% of the country's population, according to the 2011 Census of India. Uttar Pradesh (21%), West Bengal (11%), Bihar (8%) and Tamil Nadu (7%) between them accounted for almost half the country's total Scheduled Caste population. They were most prevalent as a proportion of the states' population in Punjab, at about 32 per cent, while Mizoram had the lowest at approximately zero.\nSimilar groups are found throughout the rest of the Indian subcontinent; less than 2 per cent of Pakistan's population are Hindu and 70–75 per cent of those Hindus are Dalits, in Nepal, Bangladesh had 5 million Dalits in 2010 with the majority being landless and in chronic poverty, and Sri Lanka. They are also found as part of the Indian diaspora in many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, and the Caribbean. While discrimination against Dalits has declined in urban areas and in the public sphere, it still exists in rural areas and in the private sphere, in everyday matters such as access to eating places, schools, temples and water sources. Some Dalits successfully integrated into urban Indian society, where caste origins are less obvious. In rural India, however, caste origins are more readily apparent and Dalits often remain excluded from local religious life, though some qualitative evidence suggests that exclusion is diminishing.\nIndia is home to over 200 million Dalits. According to Paul Diwakar, a Dalit activist from the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, \"India has 600,000 villages and almost every village a small pocket on the outskirts is meant for Dalits.\"\n\n## Socioeconomic status and discrimination\nDiscrimination against Dalits has been observed across South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora. In 2001, the quality of life of the Dalit population in India was worse than that of the overall Indian population on metrics such as access to health care, life expectancy, education attainability, access to drinking water and housing. According to a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), the treatment of Dalits has been like a \"hidden apartheid\" and that they \"endure segregation in housing, schools, and access to public services\". HRW noted that Manmohan Singh, then Prime Minister of India, saw a parallel between the apartheid system and untouchability. Eleanor Zelliot also notes Singh's 2006 comment but says that, despite the obvious similarities, race prejudice and the situation of Dalits \"have a different basis and perhaps a different solution\". Though the Indian Constitution abolished untouchability, the oppressed status of Dalits remains a reality. In rural India, stated Klaus Klostermaier in 2010, \"they still live in secluded quarters, do the dirtiest work, and are not allowed to use the village well and other common facilities\". In the same year, Zelliot noted that \"In spite of much progress over the last sixty years, Dalits are still at the social and economic bottom of society.\"\nAccording to the 2014 NCAER/University of Maryland survey, 27 per cent of the Indian population still practices untouchability; the figure may be higher because many people refuse to acknowledge doing so when questioned, although the methodology of the survey was also criticised for potentially inflating the figure. Across India, Untouchability was practised among 52 per cent of Brahmins, 33 per cent of Other Backward Classes and 24 per cent of non-Brahmin forward castes. Untouchability was also practised by people of minority religions – 23 per cent of Sikhs, 18 per cent of Muslims and 5 per cent of Christians. According to statewide data, Untouchability is most commonly practised in Madhya Pradesh (53 per cent), followed by Himachal Pradesh (50 per cent), Chhattisgarh (48 per cent), Rajasthan and Bihar (47 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (43 per cent), and Uttarakhand (40 per cent).\nExamples of segregation have included the Madhya Pradesh village of Ghatwani, where the Scheduled Tribe population of Bhilala do not allow Dalit villagers to use the public borewell for fetching water and thus they are forced to drink dirty water. In metropolitan areas around New Delhi and Bangalore, Dalits and Muslims face discrimination from upper caste landlords when seeking places to rent. In Southern India public tea shops follow a two tumbler system where the owner maintains a second set of cups for serving tea to Dalits.\nIn 1855, Mutka Salve, a 14-year-old student of Dalit leader Savitribai Phule, wrote that during the rule of Baji Rao of the Maratha Empire, the Dalit castes were chased away from their lands to build large buildings. They were also forced to drink oil mixed with red lead causing them to die, and then they were buried in the foundations of buildings, thus wiping out generations of Dalits. Under the rule of Baji Rao, if a Dalit crossed in front of a gym, they would cut off his head and play \"bat and ball\" on the ground, with their swords as bats and his head as a ball. Under these 17th century kings, human sacrifice of untouchable persons was not unusual. They also created intricate rules and operations to ensure that they stayed untouchables. \nGeorge Kunnath claims that there \"is and has been an internal hierarchy between the various Dalit castes\". According to Kunnath, the Dusadhs are considered the highest while the Musahars are considered the lowest within the Dalit groups.\n\n### Education\nAccording to an analysis by The IndiaGoverns Research Institute, Dalits constituted nearly half of primary school drop-outs in Karnataka during the period 2012–14. A sample survey in 2014, conducted by Dalit Adhikar Abhiyan and funded by ActionAid, found that among state schools in Madhya Pradesh, 88 per cent discriminated against Dalit children. In 79 per cent of the schools studied Dalit children are forbidden from touching mid-day meals. They are required to sit separately at lunch in 35 per cent of schools and are required to eat with specially marked plates in 28 per cent.\nThere have been incidents and allegations of SC and ST teachers and professors being discriminated against and harassed by authorities, upper castes colleagues and upper caste students in different education institutes of India. In some cases, such as in Gujarat, state governments have argued that, far from being discriminatory, their rejection when applying for jobs in education has been because there are no suitably qualified candidates from those classifications.\n\n### Poverty\nAccording to a 2014 report to the Ministry of Minority Affairs, 33.8 per cent of Scheduled Caste (SC) populations in rural India were living below the poverty line in 2011–12. In urban areas, 21.8 per cent of SC populations were below the poverty line. A 2012 survey by Mangalore University in Karnataka found that 93 per cent of Dalit families in the state of Karnataka live below the poverty line.\nSome Dalits have achieved affluence, although most remain poor. Some Dalit intellectuals, such as Chandra Bhan Prasad, have argued that the living standards of many Dalits have improved since the economic system became more liberalised starting in 1991 and have supported their claims through large surveys. According to the Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011, nearly 79 per cent of Adivasi households and 73 per cent of Dalit households were the most deprived among rural households in India. While 45 per cent of SC households are landless and earn a living by manual casual labour, the figure is 30 per cent for Adivasis.\n\n### Occupations\nIn the past, they were believed to be so impure that upper-caste Hindus considered their presence to be polluting. The \"impure status\" was related to their historic hereditary occupations that caste Hindus considered to be \"polluting\" or debased, such as working with leather, disposing of dead animals, manual scavenging, or sanitation work, which in much of India means collection & disposal of faeces from latrines.\nForced by the circumstances of their birth and poverty, some Dalit communities in India continue to work as sanitation workers: manual scavengers, cleaners of drains and sewers, garbage collectors, and sweepers of roads. As of 2019, an estimated 40 to 60 per cent of the 6 million Dalit households are engaged in sanitation work. The most common Dalit caste performing sanitation work is Valmiki (also Balmiki) caste. Others work as landless laborers, marginalized farmers, or continue in their traditional roles such as leathercraft, tanning, cobbling, and the disposal of dead animals.\n\n### Healthcare and nutrition\nDiscrimination against Dalits exists in access to healthcare and nutrition. A sample survey of Dalits, conducted over several months in Madhya Pradesh and funded by ActionAid in 2014, found that health field workers did not visit 65 per cent of Dalit settlements. 47 per cent of Dalits were not allowed entry into ration shops, and 64 per cent were given fewer grains than non-Dalits. In Haryana state, 49 per cent of Dalit children under five years were underweight and malnourished while 80 per cent of those in the 6–59 months age group were anaemic in 2015.\n\n### Crime\nDalits comprise a slightly disproportionate number of India's prison inmates. While Dalits (including both SCs and STs) constitute 25 per cent of the Indian population, they account for 33.2 per cent of prisoners. About 24.5 per cent of death row inmates in India are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which is proportionate to their population. The percentage is highest in Maharashtra (50 per cent), Karnataka (36.4 per cent) and Madhya Pradesh (36 per cent). Dalits have been arrested on false pretexts. According to Human Rights Watch, politically motivated arrests of Dalit rights activists occur and those arrested can be detained for six months without charge.\nCaste-related violence between Dalit and non-Dalits stems from ongoing prejudice by upper caste members. The Bhagana rape case, which arose out of a dispute of allocation of land, is an example of atrocities against Dalit girls and women. In August 2015, due to continued alleged discrimination from upper castes of the village, about 100 Dalit inhabitants converted to Islam in a ceremony at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. Inter-caste marriage has been proposed as a remedy, but according to a 2014 survey of 42,000 households by the New Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the University of Maryland, it was estimated that only 5 per cent of Indian marriages cross caste boundaries.\nThe latest data available from India's National Crime Records Bureau is from the year 2000. In that year a total of 25,455 crimes against Dalits were committed; 2 Dalits were assaulted every hour, and in each day 3 Dalit women were raped, 2 Dalits were murdered, and 2 Dalit homes were set on fire. Amnesty International documented a high number of sexual assaults against Dalit women, which were often committed by landlords, upper-caste villagers, and policemen, according to a study published in 2001. According to the research, only about 5% of assaults are recorded, and police dismiss at least 30% of rape reports as false. The study also discovered that police often seek bribes, threaten witnesses, and conceal evidence. Victims of rape have also been killed. There have been some reports of Dalits being forced to eat human faeces and drink urine by upper caste members in some villages. In one such instance, a 17-year-old girl was set on fire by Yadav (an OBC) youth, allegedly because she was allowed school-education. In September 2015, a 45-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly stripped naked and forced to drink urine by perpetrators in Madhya Pradesh. In some villages of India, there have been allegations that Dalit grooms riding horses for wedding ceremonies have been beaten up and ostracised by upper caste people. In August 2015, upper caste people burned houses and vehicles belonging to Dalit families and slaughtered their livestock in reaction to Dalits daring to hold a temple car procession at a village in Tamil Nadu. In August 2015, it was claimed that a Jat Khap Panchayat ordered the rape of two Dalit sisters because their brother eloped with a married Jat girl of the same village. In 2003, the higher caste Muslims in Bihar opposed the burials of lower caste Muslims in the same graveyard. A Dalit activist was killed in 2020 for social media posts criticising Brahmins. A Dalit was killed in 2019 for eating in front of upper-caste men.\n\n### Prevention of Atrocities Act\nThe Government of India has attempted on several occasions to legislate specifically to address the issue of caste-related violence that affects SCs and STs. Aside from the Constitutional abolition of untouchability, there has been the Untouchability (Offences) Act of 1955, which was amended in the same year to become the Protection of Civil Rights Act. It was determined that neither of those Acts were effective, so the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 (POA) came into force.\nThe POA designated specific crimes against SCs and STs as \"atrocities\" – a criminal act that has \"the quality of being shockingly cruel and inhumane\" – which should be prosecuted under its terms rather than existing criminal law. It created corresponding punishments. Its purpose was to curb and punish violence against Dalits, including humiliations such as the forced consumption of noxious substances. Other atrocities included forced labour, denial of access to water and other public amenities, and sexual abuse. The Act permitted Special Courts exclusively to try POA cases. The Act called on states with high levels of caste violence (said to be \"atrocity-prone\") to appoint qualified officers to monitor and maintain law and order.\nIn 2015, the Parliament of India passed the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act to address issues regarding the implementation of the POA, including instances where the police put procedural obstacles in the way of alleged victims or indeed outright colluded with the accused. It also extended the number of acts that were deemed to be atrocities. One of those remedies, in an attempt to address the slow process of cases, was to make it mandatory for states to set up the exclusive Special Courts that the POA had delineated. Progress in doing so, however, was reported in April 2017 to be unimpressive. P. L. Punia, a former chairman of the NCSC, said that the number of pending cases was high because most of the extant Special Courts were not exclusive but rather being used to process some non-POA cases, and because \"The special prosecutors are not bothered and the cases filed under this Act are as neglected as the victims\". While Dalit rights organisations were cautiously optimistic that the amended Act would improve the situation, legal experts were pessimistic.\n\n## Religion\nDiscrimination is illegal under Indian law by the Removal of Civil Disabilities Act (Act 21 of 1938), the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act 1939 (Act XXII of 1939) and Article 17 of the Constitution which outlawed Untouchability. After India's independence in 1947, secular nationalism based on a \"composite culture\" made all people equal citizens.\n\n### Hinduism\nMost Dalits in India are Hindu. There have been incidents which showed that Dalits were restricted from entering temples by high-caste Hindus, and participation in religious processions.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj and the Ramakrishna Mission actively participated in the rights of Dalits. While Dalits had places to worship, the first upper-caste temple to openly welcome Dalits was the Laxminarayan Temple in Wardha in 1928. It was followed by the Temple Entry Proclamation issued by the last King of Travancore in the Indian state of Kerala in 1936.\nIn the 1930s, Gandhi and Ambedkar disagreed regarding the retention of the Varna system. Whilst Ambedkar wanted to see it destroyed, Gandhi thought that it could be modified by reinterpreting Hindu texts so that the untouchables were absorbed into the Shudra varna. It was this disagreement that led to the Poona Pact. Gandhi began the Harijan Yatra to help the Dalits, but ran into some opposition from Dalits that wanted a complete break from Hinduism.\nThe declaration by princely states of Kerala between 1936 and 1947 that temples were open to all Hindus went a long way towards ending untouchability there. However, educational opportunities for Dalits in Kerala remain limited.\nOther Hindu groups attempted to reconcile with the Dalit community. Hindu temples are increasingly receptive to Dalit priests, a function formerly reserved for Brahmins. Brahmins such as Subramania Bharati passed Brahminhood onto a Dalit, while in Shivaji's Maratha Empire Dalit warriors joined his forces. However, in the 19th century, Dalits in the Mahar Regiment of British Bombay, defeated the oppressive rule of the Peshvas.\nThe fight for temple entry rights for Dalits continues to cause controversy. In a 2015 incident in Meerut, a Dalit belonging to the Valmiki caste was denied entry to a Hindu temple; he went on to convert to Islam. In September 2015, four Dalit women were fined by the upper-caste Hindus for entering a temple in Karnataka.\nThere have been allegations that Dalits in Nepal are denied entry to Hindu temples. In at least one case, Dalits were reportedly beaten by upper-caste people while attempting to enter a local temple.\n\n### Buddhism\nIn 1956, the Dalit jurist Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891–1956) launched the Dalit Buddhist movement, leading several mass conversions of Dalits from Hinduism to Buddhism. Ambedkar's Buddhism is a new kind of Buddhism that focuses on social and political engagement. About half a million Dalits joined Ambedkar in rejecting Hinduism and challenging its caste system. The movement is centered in Maharashtra, and according to the 2011 census, there were 6.5 million Marathi Buddhists (mainly Dalit Buddhists) in Maharashtra.\nAnother Dalit Buddhist leader and reformer was Pandit Iyothee Thass, founder of the Sakya Buddhist Society of Tamil Nadu. The Scheduled Castes Order (Amendment) Act, 1990 granted reservation to Dalit Buddhists and recognized their Scheduled Caste status.\n\n### Sikhism\nGuru Nanak in Guru Granth Sahib calls for everyone to treat each other equally. Subsequent Sikh Gurus, all of whom came from the Khatri caste, also denounced the hierarchy of the caste system. Despite this, social stratification exists in the Sikh community. The bulk of the Sikhs of Punjab belong to the Jat caste; there are also two Dalit Sikh castes in the state, called the Mazhabis and the Ramdasias.\nSurinder S. Jodhka says that, in practice, Sikhs belonging to the landowning dominant castes have not shed all their prejudices against the Dalit castes. While Dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurudwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar (the communal meal). Therefore, wherever they could mobilise resources, the Sikh Dalits of Punjab have tried to construct their gurudwara and other local-level institutions to attain a certain degree of cultural autonomy. In 1953, Sikh leader Master Tara Singh succeeded in winning the demands from the government to include Sikh castes of the converted untouchables in the list of scheduled castes. In the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), 20 of the 140 seats are reserved for low-caste Sikhs.\nSikh women are required to have the surname \"Kaur\", and men, the surname \"Singh\", to eradicate caste identities and discrimination.\nIn 2003 the Talhan village Gurudwara endured a bitter dispute between Jat Sikhs and Chamars. The Chamars came out in force and confronted the Randhawa and Bains Jat Sikh landlords, who refused to give the Chamars a share on the governing committee of a shrine dedicated to Shaheed Baba Nihal Singh. The shrine earned 3–7 crore Indian Rupees, and the Jat Sikh landlord allegedly \"gobbled up a substantial portion of the offerings\". Though Dalits form more than 60 per cent of Talhan's 5,000-strong population, local traditions ensured that they were denied a place on the committee. The landlords, in league with radical Sikh organisations and the SGPC, attempted to keep out the Dalits by razing the shrine overnight and constructing a gurdwara on it, but the Dalit quest for a say in the governing committee did not end.\nChamars fought a four-year court battle with the landlords and their allies, including the Punjab Police. In that time Jats conducted several boycotts against the Chamars. The Jat Sikhs and their allies cut off the power supply to their homes. In addition, various scuffles and fights set Chamar youths armed with lathis, rocks, bricks, soda bottles and anything they could find fought Jat Sikh landlords, youths and the Punjab police. Dalit youngsters painted their homes and motorcycles with the slogan, Putt Chamar De (proud sons of Chamars) in retaliation to the Jat slogan, Putt Jattan De.\n\n### Jainism\nHistorically Jainism was practised by many communities across India. They are often conservative and are generally considered upper-caste.\nIn 1958, a Sthanakvasi Jain called Muni Sameer Muni came into contact with members of the Khatik community in the Udaipur region, who decided to adopt Jainism. Their centre, Ahimsa Nagar, located about four miles from Chittorgarh, was inaugurated by Mohanlal Sukhadia in 1966. Sameer Muni termed them Veerwaal, that is, belonging to Mahavira. A 22-year-old youth, Chandaram Meghwal, was initiated as a Jain monk in Ahore town in Jalore district in 2005. In 2010 a Mahar engineer called Vishal Damodar was initiated as a Jain monk by Acharya Navaratna Sagar Suriji at Samet Shikhar. Acharya Nanesh, the eighth Achayra of Sadhumargi Jain Shravak Sangha, had preached among the Balai community in 1963 near Ratlam. His followers are called Dharmapal. In 1984, some of the Bhangis of Jodhpur came under the influence of Acharya Shri Tulsi and adopted Jainism.\n\n### Christianity\nChristian Dalits are found in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.\nMass conversions of lower caste Hindus to Christianity took place in order to escape the discrimination. The main Dalit groups that participated in these conversions were the Chuhras of Punjab, Chamars of North India (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh), Vankars of Gujarat, and Pulayas of Kerala.\nThe first people converted to Christianity by Jesuits of the Madura Mission were members of Nadars, Maravars, and Pallar.\nThey believed that \"Christianity is a true religion; a desire for protection from oppressors and, if possible, material aid; the desire for education for their children; and the knowledge that those who have become Christians had improved\".\nChristianity was thought to be egalitarian and could provide mobility away from the caste. Sometimes the only change seen was their religious identity. Even after conversion, in some cases, Dalits were discriminated against due to the \"residual leftover\" practice of caste discrimination from their previous traditions. This is attributed to the predominantly Hindu society they lived in. Discrimination against Dalit Christians also remained in interactions and mannerisms between castes; for example, during the earlier days, the 'lower caste Christians' had to [cover] their mouths when talking to a Syrian Christian.\nIn many cases they were still referred to by their Hindu caste names: For example Pulayans in Kerala, Pariah in Tamil Nadu, and Madigas in Andhra Pradesh, by members of all religious backgrounds.\nEven after conversion, to some extent segregation, restriction, hierarchy, and graded ritual purity remained. Data show that there is more discrimination and less class mobility among the people living in rural areas, where incidents of caste discrimination are higher among people from all religious backgrounds.\nIn many cases, the churches referred to the Dalits as 'New Christians'. It is alleged to be a derogatory term which classifies the Dalit Christians to be looked down upon by other Christians. During the earlier days of Christianity, in some churches in south India, the Dalits had either separate seating or had to attend the mass outside. Dalit Christians are also said to be grossly underrepresented amongst the clergy in some places.\nCaste-based occupations held by Dalits also show a clear segregation which perpetuated even after becoming Christian. Occupational patterns (including manual scavenging) are prevalent among Dalit Christians in north-west India are said to be quite similar to those of Dalit Hindus. Occupational discrimination for Dalit Christians goes so far as to restrict not only employment but in some cases for clean sanitation and water.\n\n### Islam\nMost of India's 140 million Muslims are descended from local converts. Many of them converted to Islam to escape Hindu upper-caste oppression. 75% of the present Indian Muslim population are Dalits.\n\n## Political involvement\nDalit-led political parties include:\n\n### National Dalit-led political parties in India\nBahujan Samaj Party, a national political party as per Election Commission of India\nAzad Samaj Party\nDalit League\n\n### Other recognized state political parties\nAzad Samaj Party\nVanchit Bahujan Aaghadi, led by Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar, Ambedkar's grandson\nRepublican Party of India factions, active in Maharashtra\nViduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi is the major Dalit party in Tamil Nadu\nLok Janshakti Party, Bihar\n\n### Nepali Dalit-led parties\nBahujan Shakti Party, Nepal\nDalit Janajati Party, Nepal\n\n### Dalit-led political parties in Pakistan\nDalit Sujag Tehreek, Pakistan\n\n### Other dalit groups\nAnti-Dalit prejudices exist in groups such as the extremist militia Ranvir Sena, largely run by upper-caste landlords in Bihar. They oppose equal treatment of Dalits and have resorted to violence. The Ranvir Sena is considered a terrorist organisation by the government of India. In 2015, Cobrapost exposed many leaders especially like C. P. Thakur alongside former PM Chandra Shekhar associated with Ranvir Sena in Bihar Dalit massacres while governments of Nitish Kumar (under pressure from BJP), Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi did nothing to get justice for Dalits.\nThe rise of Hindutva's (Hindu nationalism) role in Indian politics has accompanied allegations that religious conversions of Dalits are due to allurements like education and jobs rather than faith. Critics argue that laws banning conversion and limiting social relief for converts mean that conversion impedes economic success. However, Bangaru Laxman, a Dalit politician, was a prominent member of the Hindutva movement.\nAnother political issue is Dalit affirmative-action quotas in government jobs and university admissions. About 8 per cent of the seats in the National and State Parliaments are reserved for Scheduled Caste and Tribe candidates.\nJagjivan Ram (1908–1986) was the first scheduled caste leader to emerge at the national level from Bihar. He was member of the Constituent assembly that drafted India's constitution. Ram also served in the interim national government of 1946 He served in the cabinets of Congress party Prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. His last position in government was as Deputy Prime Minister of India in the Janata Party government of 1977–1979,\nIn modern times several Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were Dalits, including Dinanath Bhaskar, Ramchandra Veerappa and Suraj Bhan.\nIn India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, Dalits have had a major political impact. The Dalit-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had previously run the government and that party's leader, Mayawati, served several times as chief minister. Regarding her election in 2007, some reports claimed her victory was due to her ability to win support from both 17 per cent of Muslims and nearly 17 per cent Brahmins alongside 80 per cent of Dalits. However, surveys of voters on the eve of elections, indicated that caste loyalties were not the voters' principal concern. Instead, inflation and other issues of social and economic development dictated the outcome. Mayawati's success in reaching across castes has led to speculation about her as a potential future Prime Minister of India.\nAside from Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh, Damodaram Sanjivayya was chief minister of Andhra Pradesh from 11 January 1960 to 12 March 1962, and Jitan Ram Manjhi was chief minister of Bihar for just under a year. In 1997, K. R. Narayanan, who was a Dalit, was elected as President of India. In 2017, Ramnath Kovind was elected as the President of India, becoming the second dalit president of the country.\n\n### Votebank\nVotebank politics are common in India, usually based on religion or caste. Indeed, the term itself was coined by the Indian sociologist M. N. Srinivas. Dalits are often used as a votebank. There have been instances where it has been alleged that an election-winning party reneged on promises made to the Dalits made during the election campaign or have excluded them from party affairs.\n\n### Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Sub-Plan\nThe SC, ST Sub-Plan, or Indiramma Kalalu, is a budget allocation by the Government of Andhra Pradesh for the welfare of Dalits. The law was enacted in May 2013. SCs and STs have separate panels for spending. The plan was meant to prevent the government from diverting funds meant for SCs and STs to other programs, which was historically the case. As of 2013, no equivalent national plan existed. Scheduled Castes Sub Plan and Tribal Sub-Plan funds are often diverted by state governments to other purposes.\nWhile the Indian Constitution has provisions for the social and economic uplift of Dalits to support their upward social mobility, these concessions are limited to Hindus. Dalits who have converted to other religions have asked that benefits be extended to them.\n\n## Beyond the Indian subcontinent\n\n\n### United Kingdom\nAfter World War II, immigration from the former British Empire was largely driven by labour shortages. Like the rest of the Indian subcontinent diaspora, Dalits immigrated and established their own communities.\nA 2009 report alleged that caste discrimination is \"rife\" in the United Kingdom. The report alleged that casteism persists in the workplace and within the National Health Service and at doctor's offices.\nSome claim that caste discrimination is non-existent. Some have rejected the government's right to interfere in the community. The Hindu Forum of Britain conducted their own research, concluding that caste discrimination was \"not endemic in British society\", reports to the contrary aimed to increase discrimination by legislating expression and behaviour and that barriers should instead be removed through education.\nA 2010 study found that caste discrimination occurs in Britain at work and in service provision. While not ruling out the possibility of discrimination in education, no such incidents were uncovered. The report found favourable results from educational activities. However, non-legislative approaches were claimed to be less effective in the workplace and would not help when the authorities were discriminating. One criticism of discrimination law was the difficulty in obtaining proof of violations. Perceived benefits of legislation were that it provides redress, leads to greater understanding and reduces the social acceptance of such discrimination.\nMore recent studies in Britain were inconclusive and found that discrimination was \"not religion specific and is subscribed to by members of any or no religion\". Equalities Minister Helen Grant found insufficient evidence to justify specific legislation, while Shadow Equalities minister Kate Green said that the impact is on a relatively small number of people. Religious studies professor Gavin Flood of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies concluded that the Hindu community in Britain is particularly well integrated, loosening caste ties. Casteist beliefs were prevalent mainly among first-generation immigrants, with such prejudices declining with each successive generation due to greater assimilation.\nFrom September 2013 to February 2014, Indian philosopher Meena Dhanda led a project on 'Caste in Britain' for the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which focused on the proposed inclusion of a provision in the Equality Act 2010 to protect British citizens against caste discrimination. In 2018 the UK government decided not to include caste as a \"protected characteristic\" within the terms of the Act, and to rely instead on case law to identify tests for caste-based discrimination.\nSupporters of anti-caste legislation include Lord Avebury and Lady Thornton.\n\n### In the Caribbean\nIt is estimated that in 1883, about one-third of the immigrants who arrived in the Caribbean were Dalits. The shared experience of being exploited in a foreign land gradually broke down caste barriers in the Caribbean Hindu communities.\n\n### In Continental Europe\nThe Romani people, originating in northern India, are said to be of Dalit ancestry. Between 1001 and 1026, the Romani fought under their Hindu rulers to fight the Ghaznavids.\n\n### In the United States\nMany Dalits first came to the United States to flee caste-based oppression in South Asia. After the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the demand for labourers brought in many caste-diverse South Asian immigrants, many of whom were Dalit. After the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, immigrants from India were primarily professionals and students, largely from upper caste or dominant caste families. However, from the 1990s onwards, many more of the skilled professionals arriving from India have been Dalit, due to multiple generations of affirmative action policies in India, as well as ongoing efforts of organised resistance against caste discrimination.\nIn 2018, Equality Labs released a report on \"Caste in the United States\". This report found that one in two Dalit Americans live in fear of their caste being \"outed\". In addition, 60% have experienced caste-based discriminatory jokes, and 25% have suffered verbal or physical assault because of their caste.\nIn late June 2020, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Cisco Systems, alleging that a Dalit engineer at the company faced discrimination from two of his upper-caste supervisors for his Dalit background. The lawsuit claims that \"higher caste supervisors and co-workers imported the discriminatory system's practices into their team and Cisco's workplace\". In 2023, the California Civil Rights Department voluntarily dismissed its case alleging caste discrimination against two Cisco engineers, while still keeping alive its litigation against Cisco Systems. The CRD was later symbolically fined $2000 for their case against the two engineers and CISCO.\n\n## Literature\nDalit literature encompasses writings by Dalits about their lived experiences, and it has emerged as a significant literary movement and forms a distinct part of Indian literature. It has formed an identity across various Indian languages, including Marathi, Bangla, Hindi, Kannada, Punjabi, Sindhi, Odia, Tamil, and others. The earliest identifiably Dalit writers were Madara Chennaiah, an 11th-century cobbler-saint who lived in the reign of Western Chalukyas and who is regarded by some scholars as the \"father of Vachana poetry\" and Dohara Kakkaiah, a Dalit by birth, six of whose confessional poems survive. The origins of modern Dalit writing can be traced back to the works of Marathi Dalit Bhakti poets and Tamil Siddhas, suggesting a long-standing tradition of marginalized voices. This literary movement gained momentum in the mid-20th century, challenging the prevailing portrayals of life in mainstream literature. The publication of Jyotirao Phule's Gulamgiri in 1873 marked a seminal moment in Dalit literature, shedding light on the plight of the Untouchables.\nDalit literature in India has flourished in various regional languages, reflecting the diverse experiences and struggles of Dalit communities across the country. In Maharashtra, Baburao Bagul's collection of stories, \"Jevha Mi Jat Chorali\" (When I had Concealed My Caste), published in 1963, marked a significant turning point, portraying the harsh realities of Dalit lives and garnering critical acclaim. Writers like Namdeo Dhasal and Daya Pawar further strengthened the Dalit movement in Maharashtra introducing the seminal \"Dalit Panther\" as part of the little magazine movement. Baburao Bagul, Bandhu Madhav and Shankar Rao Kharat, worked in the 1960s. Later the little magazine movement became popular. In Bengal, the Dalit literary movement began in 1992 after the suicide of Chuni Kotal, leading to the formation of the Bangla Dalit Sahitya Sanstha and the launch of the magazine \"Chaturtha Duniya\". Prominent Dalit authors in Bengal include Manoranjan Byapari, Jatin Bala, and Kalyani Charal. Tamil Nadu has a long history of Dalit literature, starting from the efforts of Parayars in the late 19th century. The Tamil Dalit literary movement gained momentum in the 1990s, influenced by the Mandal Commission report and Ambedkar centenary celebrations. Writers like Bama, Joseph Macwan, and Gogu Shyamala have made significant contributions to Tamil Dalit literature. In Telugu literature, Dalit voices gained prominence through the activism of leaders like Kathi Padma Rao and Bojja Tarakam, addressing issues of caste discrimination and social injustice. Gujarati Dalit literature emerged in the 1970s with magazines like Puma and Panther, inspired by the Dalit Panthers movement in Maharashtra. Writers such as Rameshchandra Parmar and Sahil Parmar played vital roles in its development. Odia Dalit literature has a rich history dating back to the fifteenth century, with significant contributions from Sudramuni Sarala Dasa and Bhima Bhoi. Writers like Basudeb Sunani and Pitambar Tarai have furthered the Dalit literary movement in Odisha. Additionally, Dalit literature encompasses various forms such as poetry, autobiographies, and oral history narratives, with notable works including \"Karukku\" by Bama and \"The Weave of My Life\" by Urmila Pawar. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar has written a play titled 'Gandhi, Ambedkar, and the Four-Legged Scorpion' in which the personal experiences of Ambedkar and the sufferings of the community have been highlighted.\nIn Sri Lanka, writers such as K. Daniel and Dominic Jeeva gained mainstream popularity.\n\n## In the film industry\nUntil the 1980s, Dalits had little involvement in Bollywood or other film industries of India and the community were rarely depicted at the heart of storylines. Chirag Paswan (son of Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan) launched his career in Bollywood with his debut film Miley Naa Miley Hum in 2011. Despite political connections and the financial ability to struggle against ingrained prejudices, Chirag was not able to \"bag\" any other movie project in the following years. Chirag, in his early days, described Bollywood as his \"childhood dream\", but eventually entered politics instead. When the media tried to talk to him about \"Caste in Bollywood\", he refused to talk about the matter. A recent Hindi film to portray a Dalit character in the leading role, although it was not acted by a Dalit, was Eklavya: The Royal Guard (2007). The continued use of caste based references to Dalit sub-castes in South Indian films (typecast and pigeonholed in their main socio-economic sub-group) angers many Dalit fans.\nA Brazilian telenovela India: A Love Story was broadcast in 2009 where the main female character Maya, who is of upper class, falls in love with a Dalit person.\n\n## Internal conflicts\nSeveral Dalit groups are rivals and sometimes communal tensions are evident. A study found more than 900 Dalit sub-castes throughout India, with internal divisions. Emphasising any one caste threatens what is claimed to be an emerging Dalit identity and fostering rivalry among SCs.\nA DLM (Dalit Liberation Movement) party leader said in the early 2000s that it is easier to organise Dalits on a caste basis than to fight caste prejudice itself.\nBalmikis and Pasis in the 1990s boycotted the BSP, claiming it was a Jatav party. \nMany converted Dalit Sikhs claim a superior status over the Hindu Raigars, Joatia Chamars and Ravidasis and sometimes refuse to intermarry with them. They are divided into gotras that regulate their marriage alliances. In Andhra Pradesh, Mala and Madiga were constantly in conflict with each other but as of 2015 Mala and Madiga students work for common dalit cause at university level.\nAlthough the Khateek (butchers) are generally viewed as a higher caste than Bhangis, the latter refuses to offer cleaning services to Khateeks, believing that their profession renders them unclean. They also consider the Balai, Dholi and Mogya as unclean and do not associate with them.\n\n## Notable people\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n### Similarly discriminated groups\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nBallard, Roger (1994).

Authors such as Sharankumar Limbale, Namdeo Dhasal, and Bama, and movements like the Dalit Panther movement in Maharashtra as well as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, an advocate for Dalit rights, have played influential roles in shaping Dalit literature across India.\nDalit feminist writing such as the autobiographies and testimonios of Dalit women authors emphasizing the intersection of caste, class, and gender in the context of social exclusion came through this movement. Dalit women authors, such as Urmila Pawar and Baby Kamble, have written extensively about the complexities of caste, class, and gender in Indian society.\n\n## Early Dalit literature\nOne of the first Dalit writers was Madara Chennaiah, an 11th-century cobbler-saint who lived during the reign of the Western Chalukyas and who is also regarded by some scholars as the \"father of Vachana poetry.\" Another poet from the same Jangam order, who finds mention is Dohara Kakkayya, a Dalit by birth, whose six confessional poems survive. Chokhamela, initiated into the bhakti movement by the poet-saint Namdev, sang several songs in the abhang style during the 14th century. Ravidas (15th-16th century) was also a renowned spiritual leader in the bhakti tradition who came from leather-working caste. Other Marathi Bhakti poets such as Gora, and Karmamela, and the Tamil Siddhas, or Chittars are also suggested to have been Dalits.\nThe Panchasakha poets—Balarama Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Achyutanda Dasa, Jasobanta Dasa, and Ananta Dasa—were influential in Odia literature from 1450 to 1550 AD. They wrote in the vernacular in Odia literature which helped establish colloquial Odia's use in literature, representing a departure from Sanskrit-dominated literary traditions. Their contributions include translations of sacred Hindu texts into accessible language, such as Jagmohan Ramayan, Odia Bhagabata, Harivamsa, Premabhakti Brahmagita, and Hetudaya Bhagabata. Sudramuni Sarala Dasa is noted as a pioneer of the social protest movement in Odisha during the fifteenth century. A Sudra by caste, he depicted the experiences of the marginalised through works written in the vernacular language. His major works, the Odia Mahabharata, the Bilanka Ramayana, and Chandi Purana focused on contemporary issues and everyday experiences and directly critiqued the dominance of Sanskrit in literature and royalty as subjects of such literature. \nTelugu Dalit literature has a history dating back to the 17th century, featuring poets such as Potuluri Veerabrahmam and Yogi Vemana, who wrote about the societal evils of caste and untouchability.\n\n## Modern Dalit literature\nThe body of modern Dalit literature, which encompasses a growing collection of work, is largely rooted in developments from the late 1960s onward. Nevertheless, its origins can be traced to the early 19th century. Modern Dalit writing only emerged as a distinct genre following reformist thinkers and writers such as Narayana Guru, Jyotirao Phule, B.R. Ambedkar, Iyothee Thass, Sahodaran Ayyappan, Ayyankali, Poykayil Appachan, among others. \nAccording to scholars Satyanarayana and Tharu, Dalit literature gained traction when the Dalit Panthers movement revitalized and extended the ideas of Ambedkar, critiquing Indian nationalism's Gandhian perspective and launching a new social movement centred on Dalit rights and empowerment. Over subsequent decades, Dalit writing evolved into a nationwide phenomenon, reformulating the issue of caste and reassessing the impacts of colonialism and missionary activity. Tatyanarayana and Tharu note that these works vividly illustrate and analyze the persistent workings of caste power in contemporary India  Dalit author Sharankumar Limbale characterizes Dalit literature as a medium for expressing the grief inherent in Dalit lives, documenting experiences of discrimination, poverty, and social exclusion faced by Dalit communities. Jaydeep Sarangi, in his 2018 introduction to Dalit Voice, writes that Dalit literature is a culture-specific upheaval in India giving importance to Dalit realization, aesthetics and resistance.\nThe movement can be traced back to the publication of Gulamgiri by Jyotirao Phule in 1873, which set the stage for future writers to explore and express the experiences of Dalits. Notable contributors to Modern Dalit literature include Mahasweta Devi, Arjun Dangle, Sachi Rautray, Rabi Singh, Basudev Sunani, Bama, Abhimani, Poomani, Imayam, Marku, Mangal Rathod, Neerav Patel, Perumal Murugan, Palamalai, Yendluri Sudhakar, and D. Gopi.\nIn recent years, new voices in Dalit literature have emerged, broadening the scope and impact of this genre. Among these are P. Sivakami, whose work The Grip of Change is acclaimed for its insights into Dalit life, and Vijila Chirrappad, a writer from Kerala who addresses the challenges facing Dalit women. Dev Kumar, founder of Apna Theatre in 1992, has used drama to promote Dalit consciousness, while Tamil Nadu-based Meena Kandasamy combines feminist and anti-caste themes to highlight the intersections of gender and caste discrimination.\nThe first Dalit literature conference, Dalit Sahitya Sammelan, was held in 1958 organised by Annabhau Sathe. He was a communist, who turned to Ambedkarite movement in the later part of his life. This gathering is widely recognized as an event that was foundational in it establishment of Dalit literature as a literary genre.\n\n## Regional literature\n\n\n### Dalit literature in Marathi\nDalit literature in the modern era emerged in the Marathi language as a literary movement as a precursor to its flourishing in various Indian languages. The formation of a distinct literary culture can be traced to the formation of Anarya Dosh Pariharak Mandal in 1890 started with retired British army officials from the Mahar and Chambar communities. Its president, Gopal Baba Valangkar, a close associate of Phule, started his main body of literary work for the Mahars post his retirement from the British Army. However, the need for an organisation to promote cultural awareness amongst these communities was already articulated by their contemporary poet Kondaji Ramji or Pandit Kondiram. The latter had already written on the inhumane conditions leading to death imposed on the Mahars. Kondiram's poetry made distinctions between Hinduism dictated by the Manusmriti's Brahmanic laws and the Bhakti movement as a path to spiritual enlightenment.\nIn 1958, the term \"Dalit literature\" was used at the first conference of Maharashtra Dalit Sahitya Sangha (Maharashtra Dalit Literature Society) in Mumbai. Notable Dalit authors writing in Marathi include Arun Kamble, Shantabai Kamble, Raja Dhale, Namdev Dhasal, Daya Pawar, Annabhau Sathe, Laxman Mane, Laxman Gaikwad, Sharankumar Limbale, Bhau Panchbhai, Kishor Shantabai Kale, Narendra Jadhav, Shankar Rao Kharat, and Urmila Pawar.\nBaburao Bagul's first collection of stories, Jevha Mi Jat Chorali (English: When I Hid My Caste), published in 1963, depicted the societal cruelty experienced by Dalits and thus brought in a new momentum to Dalit literature in Marathi. Actor-director Vinay Apte later adapted it into a film, contributing further to its cultural impact. Namdeo Dhasal, who founded Dalit Panther and its members wrote works that amplified the genre's impact on Marathi literature.\nShankarrao Kharat served as president of the 1984 session of  Marathi Sahitya Sammelan (Marathi literary conference) held in Jalgaon highlighting the increasing acceptance of Dalit voices in mainstream Marathi literary forums. Dalit literature started being mainstream in India with the appearance of the English translations of Marathi Dalit writing. An Anthology of Dalit Literature, edited by Mulk Raj Anand and Eleanor Zelliot, and Poisoned Bread: Translations from Modern Marathi Dalit Literature, originally published in three volumes and later collected in a single volume, edited by Arjun Dangle and published in 1992. 'Poisoned Bread' - the collection takes its name from a story by Bandhu Madhav about Yetalya Aja, a Mahar who is forced to consume stale bread covered in dung and urine and dies as a result. Before he dies, Aja tells his grandson to get an education and take away the accursed bread from the mouths of Mahars. \nIn 1993, Ambedkari Sahitya Parishad organized the first Akhil Bharatiya Ambedkari Sahitya Sammelan (All India Ambedkarite Literature Convention) in Wardha, Maharashtra to re-conceptualize and transform Dalit literature into Ambedkari Sahitya, named after the Dalit modern-age hero, advocate and scholar B.R. Ambedkar. Ambedkari Sahitya Parishad then successfully organized the Third Akhil Bharatiya Ambedkari Sahitya Sammelan in 1996 and became a voice of advocacy for awareness and transformation.\n\n### Dalit literature in Bengali\nIn Bengali literature, the term \"charal,\" derived from the Sanskrit word \"chandal,\" serves as an umbrella term for Scheduled Castes, and the literature emerging from this context is often referred to as \"Charal literature.\" This genre reflects the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities in Bengal. Notable examples of Charal literature include Jatin Bala's Sekor Chhera Jibon (An Uprooted Life) and Samaj Chetanar Galpa (Stories of Social Awakening) and Kalyani Charal's Chandalinir Kobita. The development of Dalit literature in Bengal was significantly influenced by the leadership of Harichand Thakur, a prominent figure in the Motua community, and the ideas of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. \nScholars like Sekhar Bandyopadhyay in The Namasudra Movement and Sumit Sarkar in Writing Social History highlight the influence of the Motua community in developing caste consciousness and anti-caste movements in colonial Bengal. The Motua faith developed as an ideological opposition to Brahmanical Hindu practices in East Bengal and has since expanded to include various marginalized lower castes. Themes in Charal literature address a variety of issues, including the role of women in Motua religious teachings, the work ethic promoted by Harichand Thakur, and the relevance of Harichand's teachings to the Namasudra uprisings. Additionally, these writings explore the relationship between Motua dharma and the works of B.R. Ambedkar. According to Bandyopadhyay, Motua songs convey messages aimed at enhancing the self-confidence and collective identity of the oppressed community. \nThe Dalit Panther movement in Maharashtra led by influential figures such as Namdeo Dhasal has also inspired the Dalit literary movement in Bengal. This movement produced literature that starkly contrasts with the prevailing literary trends in Bengal, which often focused on romanticism and nationalism while neglecting pressing social issues. The autobiography of Dalit proletariat author Manoranjan Byapari, Itibritte Chandal Jiban, has garnered critical acclaim, further elevating the visibility and popularity of Dalit literature in Bengal. Other active Dalit journals in the region include Adhikar, Dalit Mirror, Nikhil Bharat, and Neer. \nThe organized Dalit literary movement in Bengal began in 1992, following the death-by-suicide of Chuni Kotal, which sparked widespread protests. These events led to the formation of the Bangla Dalit Sahitya Sanstha and the launch of the magazine Chaturtha Duniya. Chaturtha Duniya, which translates to \"Fourth World,\" refers to the world of the fourth varna of the caste system while articulating the experiences of living in a world within the third world. This magazine has been instrumental in highlighting the works of significant Dalit writers in Bengal, including Manohar Mouli Biswas, Jatin Bala, Kapil Krishna Thakur, Kalyani Charal, Manju Bala, and others.\n\n### Dalit literature in Tamil\nDalit literature in Tamil Nadu has a significant historical context, emerging prominently in the late 19th century through the efforts of educated members of the Parayar community, a Scheduled Caste in Tamil Nadu, in the late 19th century. Iyothee Thass Pandithar, a prominent leader, advocated for a casteless Tamil society drawing on his interpretations of ancient Tamil history. His re-readings of ancient Tamil history spread ideas of socialism, rationality, and modernity in colonial India. He also protested against Manudharmic Brahminism and fought for the dignity and rights of the \"untouchable communities,\" urging them to identify themselves as Panchamars (fifth Caste).\nDalit intellectuals regularly published journals like Oru Paisa Tamizhan, Parayan, Adi Dravidan, and Vazhikattovone in the early decades of the 20th century, providing a space to discuss and denounce Brahminical ideals and notions of Swadeshi ideals. These journals played a pivotal role in fostering awareness of Adi Dravida politics and identity. Adi Dravida leaders appreciated the zeal and social commitment of the Self-respect movement and urged Adi Dravidas to support it.\nThe 1940s witnessed a rise in communist movements in Tamil Nadu, which was very influential for Adi Dravida writers and proponents. Prominent Dalit writers, such as Daniel Selvaraj and Poomani, engaged with Marxist ideologies, reflecting the economic struggles faced by their community in their literary works. This era marked the early development of Tamil Dalit literature, characterized by novels and short stories authored by Adi Dravida writers.\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were pivotal for the Tamil Dalit literary movement. Writers began addressing issues related to caste discrimination, social injustice, and economic inequalities. However, it was in the 1990s that the Tamil Dalit literary movement gained momentum. The release of the Mandal Commission report in the 1990s catalyzed communal tensions and heightened Dalit awareness, prompting the formation of a distinct caste identity. Additionally, the centenary celebrations of B.R. Ambedkar in 1992 revitalized interest in his principles and ideas among Tamil Dalits.\nThe annual Dalit cultural festival, organized by the Dalit Athara Maiyam, articulated issues and problems related to Dalits. Dalit cultural festivals were conducted in Pondicherry and Neyveli in 1992.  The influence of the little magazine movement, which gained traction in India during the 1950s and 1960s, also impacted Tamil Dalit literature in the 1990s. This period witnessed a spurt of Dalit journals like Dalit Murasu, Kodangi (later renamed Pudiya Kodangi), Manusanga, Dalit, and Mallar Malar. Journals like Subamangala, Nirapirigai, Kavithasaran, Ilakku, Thinamani Kathir, and Sathangai published special issues focusing on Dalit literature, contributing significantly to its growth and recognition. Over the next decade, the production of Dalit literature and the arts flourished. Writers such as Sivakami, Edayavendan, Unjai Rajan Abimani, Bama, Anbadavan, K. A. Gunasekaran, Imaiyam emerged during this time, significantly contributing to the genre. Notable works include Sivakami's \"Pazhiyana Kazhidalum\" (The Grip of Change) and Bama's \"Karukku,\" noted as the first Dalit novel in Tamil written by a woman.\n\n### Dalit literature in Punjabi\nDalit literature in Punjab has a significant tradition characterized by the contributions of various poets throughout history. The origins of this literary tradition can be traced back to Bhai Jaita (1657–1704), a devoted disciple of Guru Gobind Singh, who composed the devotional epic Sri Gur Katha. In the early nineteenth century, Sant-poet Sadhu Wazir Singh (1790–1859) became a notable figure, producing works that explored spiritual, social, and philosophical themes. Wazir Singh's writings challenged established Brahmanical structures and advocated for gender equality, promoting a vision of a society free from hierarchical constraints. Sadhu Daya Singh Arif (1894–1946), born into a landless untouchable Mazhabi Sikh family, overcame educational challenges to write poetic works, including \"Zindagi Bilas\" and \"Sputtar Bilas\".\nOthers such as Giani Ditt Singh played a crucial role in the Singh Sabha movement which advocated a return to true Sikhism as a counter to proselytizing by Christian missionaries and organisations like the Arya Samaj. As the editor of the Khalsa Akhbar, he significantly contributed to Sikh intellectualism. Ditt Singh's works covered a wide range of subjects, from love-lore and Sikh traditions to history and ethics, often critiquing popular religious practices rooted in what he considered \"superstitious beliefs.\n\n### Dalit literature in Telugu\nFollowing India's independence, a new generation of Dalit poets, artists, and intellectuals emerged, bringing literary art into the public domain and supporting socio-political movements in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Communist Party’s Jana Natya Mandali used oral storytelling and folk art to spread messages among Dalit communities. Various theatrical forms, including Burrakatha, Yakshaganam, Oggukatha and other street plays were used in activist movements. Prominent activist-singers, such as Gaddar, Masterji, Goreti Venkanna, Suddala Hanumanthu, Bandi Yadagiri and Guda Anjanna, Mittapelli Surender and Andesri, used their songs to advocate for revolution, eventually making their way into the mainstream Telugu industry.\nFollowing the Karamchedu massacre in 1985, there was increased attention to issues of caste discrimination and catalysed a greater solidarity among Dalit activists and communities. This event also united two influential Dalit intellectuals, Kathi Padma Rao and Bojja Tarakam, who assumed leadership roles within the Dalit Mahasabha in 1987, making it an influential advocacy organisation. Many Dalit poetry anthologies were also published during this period, including \"Padunekkina Pata\" and \"Chikkanaina Pata\", alongside contributions from women writers such as Gogu Shyamala, Joopaka Subhadra, Jajula Gowri, and Challapalli Swaroopa Rani.\n\n### Dalit literature in Gujarati\nDalit literature in Gujarati began to gain momentum in the mid-1970s with the launch of Puma, a literary magazine edited by Rameshchandra Parmar. This was followed by the publication of several other magazines such as Akrosh, KaloSooraj, Garud, Dalit Bandhu, NayaMarg, and Disa. In 1975, a group of youths in Ahmedabad started publishing a magazine called Panther, inspired by the Dalit Panthers. The movement gained momentum during the state of emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975 and the anti-reservation agitations in 1981 and 1985. The first collection of Gujarati Dalit poetry appeared in a magazine in 1978, featuring contributions from writers such as Neerav Patel, Dalpat Chauhan, Pravin Gadhvi, and Yogesh Dave. Ganpat Parmar and Manishi Jani later published the first comprehensive collection of Gujarati Dalit literature. In 1981, the first collection of Dalit poetry, Dalit Kavita, edited by Ganpat Parmar and Manishi Jani, was published. Another collection called Visphot, edited by Balkrishna Anand and Chandu Maheria, was published in 1983. Asmita, a collection of poems published in the Dalit periodical Nayamarg between 1981 and 1983, was published by the Gujarat Khet Vikas Parishad in 1983.\nOther notable writers in this genre include Sahil Parmar, Joseph Macwan, Harish Mangalam, Pathik Parmar, Mohan Parmar, Madhukantkalpit, and B.N. Vankar. Joseph Macwan was the first Gujarati Dalit writer to receive a Sahitya Akademi award. Macwan's novel Angliyat is regarded as a seminal piece Gujarati literature, depicting the lives and struggles of the Vankar community.\n\n### Dalit literature in Odia\nNotable writers include Basudeb Sunani, Samir Ranjan, Sanjay Bag, Pitambar Tarai, Ramesh Malik, Chandrakant Malik, Kumaramani Tanti, Supriya Malik, Basant Malik, Akhila Nayak, Anjubala Jena, Mohan Jena, Samuel Dani, Anand Mahanand, Panchanan Dalei, and Pravakar Palka.\nIn the nineteenth century, Bhima Bhoi, a Kondh tribal poet and follower of Mahima Dharma, continued the tradition of protest literature. His works, such as the Stuti Chintamani, the Srutinisedha Gita, and the Nirbeda Sadhana, criticized orthodox rituals and societal customs in Odisha. In 1953, Dalit Jati Sangha (Dalit League) was founded by Govinda Chandra Seth, Santanu Kumar Das, Jagannath Malik, Kanhu Malik, and Kanduri Malik and led to the creation of various literary works. Seth’s biography of B.R. Ambedkar and Das’s novels—Awhana, Vitamati, Sania, and Pheria—focused on themes of caste inequality and social injustice.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, there was an emergence of Dalit voices in Odisha through literature. Bichitrananda Nayak is recognized as a significant figure in Odia Dalit writings, publishing Anirbana (Liberation) in 1972, which incorporated the term \"Dalit\" in various poems. Other notable writers and poets include Krushna Charan Behera. The Ambedkar centenary celebrations in 1991 inspired a larger number of Odia Dalit poets and writers to reflect on their histories and openly discuss issues of caste, class, and gender exploitation.\n\n## Dalit autobiographies\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Dalit autobiographies in India emerged as a powerful tool for social and political protest. Baluta, a groundbreaking autobiography by Dagdu Maruti Pawar that questioned the caste system and the social stigma associated with Dalit names, was one of the first and most impactful works. Many other Dalit writers followed suit, asserting their identity and protesting oppression through memoirs, poetry, and autobiographical fiction. Annabhau Sathe's autobiography Fakira (1972), Baburao Bagul's autobiographical novel Jevha Mi Jaat Chorli Hoti (1963), Babytai Kamble's Jina Amucha, Urmila Pawar's Aaydan, Shantabai Kamble's Majya Jalmachi Chittarkatha, Omprakash Valmiki's autobiographical poetry Joothan (1997), Siddalingaiah's Ooru Keri (1995), and Bama's Karukku (1992) are among the notable writers and works. Authors such as Narendra Jadhav, Loknath Yashwant, Kumar Anil, G.K. Ainapure, Avinash Gaikwad, and Santosh Padmakar Pawar write of their achievements, while Urmila Pawar, Sushama Deshpande, Ushakiran Atram, Ashalata Kamble, Sandhya Rangari, Kavita Morwankar, and Chayya Koregaonkar discuss the intersection of caste and gender.\n\n### Dalit women's autobiographies and testimonios\nthe testimonio is for a Dalit woman a powerful medium to protest against adversaries within and without\nDalit women's autobiographies and testimonios have significantly influenced Dalit literature by highlighting documenting experiences related to caste-based discrimination and social exclusion. These narratives emphasize the intersection of caste, class, and gender in the context of social exclusion. Prominent Dalit women authors, have brought attention to the struggles of their communities, contributing to the development of Dalit feminism and providing a foundation for understanding the complexities of caste, class, and gender in Indian society. Scholars like Sharmila Rege have argued that Dalit women's testimonios present alternative perspectives to mainstream historical narratives within both Dalit and women's movements and that these narratives can be understood as expressions of protest, resistance, and identity formation, asserting the subjectivity of marginalized individuals and communities.\nSome prominent Dalit women authors and their works include:\n\nKarukku (1992) by Bama: This Tamil work, translated into English with the same title, highlights the issues of caste, class, and gender as important markers for social exclusion. Bama's writing has been praised for breaking taboos, challenging social conventions and representing the experiences of marginalized communities.\nAaydan (The Weave of My Life: A Dalit Woman's Memoirs, 2003) by Urmila Pawar: Pawar compares her act of writing about her life with her mother's weaving of bamboo baskets, representing the suffering and agony of their experiences.\nRatrandin Amha ('For Us – These Nights and Days', 1990) by Shantabai Dhanaji Dani: This testimonio recounts her participation in protests against British colonial authority, her arrest, and detainment in Yerwada jail in 1946. Dani was the secretary of the Nasik branch of Scheduled Caste Federation at the time, a significant accomplishment for a Dalit woman.\nAntasphot ('Thoughtful Outburst', 1981) by Kumud Pawade: Pawade emphasizes that her outburst is not emotional but analytical, examining the experiences of individuals and communities. She highlights the double exploitation faced by Dalit women in a culture based on hierarchy.\nJinne Amuche ('Our Lives', 1986) by Baby Kondiba Kamble: Kamble's work underscores the inextricability of the individual and the collective in Dalit narratives by contextualizing her life against the backdrop of the five-decade history of the Mahar community.\nDeathly Pains (1992) by Janabai Kachru Girhe: As the first woman teacher and first woman of the Gopal community, a nomadic group, to write her testimony, Girhe offers insight into the lives of nomadic families and their experiences of hardship.\nMaajhi Me by Yashodara Gaikwad\nMala Uddhvasta Vhaychay (I Want To Destroy Myself: A Memoir) by Malika Amar Shaik\n\n### Other examples of literary forms\nDalit Hip-Hop\nDalit Christian Hymns\n\n## Mentioned authors\n\n\n## See also\nList of Dalit works\nDalit studies\nDalit music\n\n## Further reading\nMuthukkaruppan, Parthasarathi.(2018) \" Preliminary Remarks on Dalit Poetry\" Rethinking Marxism Vol.30 no.1 available at Preliminary Remarks on Dalit Poetry: Rethinking Marxism: Vol 30, No 1\nAston, N.M.

    "text": "# Dalle Khursani\n\nDalle Khursani \n(Nepali: डल्ले खुर्सानी,\nSikkimese: ཁ་ཚ་ཏྲི kha tsha tri), Akabare Khursani, red cherry pepper chilli or simply Dalle is a variety of chilli pepper primarily cultivated in Nepal, Bhutan, the Indian state of Sikkim, and the Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of Indian state of West Bengal. Its pungency ranges between 100,000 and 350,000 SHU (Scoville heat units), similar to the Habanero chilli pepper.\n\n## Etymology\nThe name Dalle Khursani literally translates to ‘round chillies’ in Nepali, owing to its physical attributes. In Nepal, it is also called Akabare Khursani (lit. king of chillies) or Jyaanamara Khursani (lit. murderer chillies).\nIn the Sikkimese Bhutia language, it is known as akubari (lit. spicy uncle).\n\n## Plant\nDalle Khursani are the only known polyploidal variety of pepper. The plant belongs to the family Solanaceae and genus Capsicum. It grows up to 100-130 cm height in an open field and 150-180 cm height in greenhouse conditions.\n\n### Fruit\nThe chilli is high in vitamin A, vitamin E, and potassium, and low in sodium. One hundred grams of fresh dalle khursani have 240 mg of vitamin C (five times higher than an orange), 11,000 IU of vitamin A, and 0.7 mg of vitamin E. Its pungency ranges between 100,000 and 350,000 SHU (Scoville heat units), similar to the Habanero chilli pepper.\n\n## Serving methods\nWhole chilli: as a relish eaten with Dal bhat.\nChopped: used in various vegetable and meat curries.\nPaste: as chutneys and sauces for Momo.\nPickle: Dalle Achaar\nFermented: fermented with yak–buttermilk\n\n## Trade\nIn 2019 Sikkim produced around 250 tonnes of dalle khursani. Around 60 percent of the state's production of the chilli is consumed within the state; a major portion of the rest is sold in North Bengal and Northeast India. The state government-owned Sikkim Supreme procured 50 tonnes of the chilli that year to make pickles and pastes.\n\n### Geographical Indication\nIn 2020 India's department of Industry Promotion and Internal Trade granted the Geographic Indication (GI) tag for the chilli to the Indian state of Sikkim based on application filed by the North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation. In September 2021 the GI tag was extended to the neighbouring Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts where the chilli has also been grown for ages.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Maldivian cuisine\n\nMaldivian cuisine, also called Dhivehi cuisine, is the cuisine of the Maldives and Minicoy, Lakshadweep, India. The traditional cuisine of Maldivians and Lakshadweep is based on three main items and their derivatives: coconuts, fish, and starches.\n\n## Coconuts\nCoconuts are used in grated form, squeezed to obtain coconut milk, or their coconut oil is used in dishes that are deep-fried. The hunigondi is the traditional Maldivian implement used to grate the coconut, consisting of a long low chair with a serrated steel blade at its end. Grated coconut is used in dishes such as mas huni, and maskurolhi.\nThe grated coconut may be alternatively soaked in water and squeezed in order to obtain coconut milk (kaashi kiru). Coconut milk is an essential ingredient in many Maldivian curries and other dishes.\n\n## Fish\nThe fish of choice is mostly skipjack tuna (kaṇḍumas), either dried or fresh. Other similar fish species that are part of the average Maldivian diet are little tunny (laṭṭi), yellowfin tuna (kanneli), frigate tuna (raagondi), bigeye scad (mushimas), wahoo (kurumas), mahi-mahi (fiyala), bluefin jack (handi), and mackerel scad (rimmas). These can be eaten boiled or processed.\nPieces or shavings of Maldives fish (cured tuna) are commonly used. In order to make curries, the raw or the still-soft processed tuna is cut into 1⁄2-inch-thick (13 mm) sections. Dry processed tuna is mainly used to make short eats (hedhika) such as gulha, masroshi, kulhi (bōkiba), kavaabu, fathafolhi, and  bajiyaa (the local version of the Indian samosa). Mas huni is a popular breakfast item consisting of fish mixed with coconut, onions, and chili. Unlike Pacific islanders, Maldivians do not have a tradition of eating raw fish.\nThe tuna-based thick brown paste known as rihaakuru is also an essential item in Maldivian cuisine.\n\n## Starches\nPopular starches are rice, which is eaten boiled or ground into flour, tubers such as taro (ala), sweet potato (kattala), and cassava (dandialuvi), as well as fruits like breadfruit (bambukeyo) or screwpine (kashikeyo). Tubers and breadfruit are eaten boiled. The screwpine fruit is mostly eaten raw after having been cut into thin slices.\n\n## Curries\nThe most important curry in the cuisine of the Maldives is cooked with diced fresh tuna and is known as mas riha.\nKukulhu riha (chicken curry) is cooked with a different mixture of spices.\nVegetable curries in the Maldives include those that use bashi (eggplant), tora (Luffa aegyptiaca), barabō (pumpkin), chichanda (Trichosanthes cucumerina) and muranga faiy (moringa leaves), as well as green unripe bananas and certain leaves as their main ingredients. Pieces of Maldives fish are normally added to give the vegetable curry a certain flavor. Curries are usually eaten with steamed rice or with roshi.\n\n## Dishes\nBis riha – curry with the main ingredient being boiled eggs and different spices.\nGulha (Dhivehi: ގުޅަ, pronounced [guɭa]) – deep-fried balls filled with coconut, tuna, and chili pepper. Other ingredients like curry leaves, ginger, and turmeric can also be added. Gulha are usually served with hot tea as a snack.\nGarudhiya (Dhivehi: ގަރުދިޔަ) – fish broth, most commonly with boiled tuna or skipjack tuna. It is the national dish of Maldives\nHuni roshi – a coconut flatbread originating from the Maldives. It is usually eaten during breakfast and is often paired with sweet or savory sides.\nKandu kukulhu – Maldivian tuna curry, prepared by rolling tuna fillets through traditional spices which are then cooked in coconut milk.\nMaldives fish (Dhivehi: ވަޅޯމަސް, romanized: valhoamas) – one of the most well-known and popular dishes within the Maldives. Gutted and skinned fish are boiled, smoked, and sun dried. Maldives fish is a tarry black color with a dry texture.\nMaskurolhi – a tuna and coconut chutney similar in appearance to that of mas huni. It is usually eaten with baipen (Maldivian congee).\nMas huni (Dhivehi: މަސްހުނި) – a breakfast dish consisting of tuna and coconut. Salt and onions can be additionally added.\nMas riha (Dhivehi: މަސް ރިހަ) – fish curry\nMasroshi – a traditional snack made of fried, stuffed dough that is usually filled with ingredients such as tuna, coconut, onions, garlic, and ginger. Lime juice can also be drizzled on top.\nMiruhulee boava – octopus tentacles braised in curry leaves, chili, garlic, cloves, onion, pepper, and coconut oil\nRihaakuru (Dhivehi: ރިހާކުރު; pronounced [ɾihaːkuru]) – a thick, brown, nearly-black sauce that is the byproduct of making of Maldives fish. Rihaakuru is consumed almost daily in every household in the Maldives and Minicoy since ancient times. Rihaakuru is cooked on low-heat until it loses its low-viscosity consistency as a result of evaporation, resulting in a thick residue.\nScrewpine (Dhivehi: ކަށިކެޔޮ, romanized: kashikeyo) – a common ingredient in Maldivian cooking but can also be eaten standalone. They are usually sold in markets.\n\n## See also\nIndian cuisine\nGarudhiya, the national dish of Maldives\nMaahefun, a Maldivian celebration marking the beginning of Ramadan\nRihaakuru, a sauce consumed almost daily in all Maldivian households\n\n## Bibliography\nXavier Romero-Frias, Eating on the Islands, Himal Southasian, Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69–91 ISSN 1012-9804\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Cuisine of the Maldives at Wikimedia Commons\nEating on the Islands - As times have changed, so has the Maldives' unique cuisine and culture\nDhumashi\nMas huni and Masriha - Himal: Farms, Feasts, Famines; Disappearing foods\nMaldives Cuisine\nMaldivian Recipes",

Peanuts are sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.\n\n## Breakfast\nBreakfast (quraac) is an important meal for people in Djibouti, who often start the day with some style of tea (shaah) or coffee (buna). The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread called lahoh, which might also be eaten with a stew or soup, such as wat. It is similar to the Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. A side dish of liver (usually beef), goat meat (hilib ari), diced beef cooked in a bed of soup (suqaar), or jerky (oodkac or muqmad), may also be served. Three pieces of lahoh are often eaten along with honey, ghee, and a cup of tea.\n\n## Lunch and dinner\nLunch (qado) and dinner (casho) are often served with an elaborate main dish of stew (maraq), which comes in a variety of styles and flavors. Rice (bariis) is often served with meat and/or a banana on the side. In Djibouti City, steak and fish are widely consumed. Pasta (baasto) is frequently presented with a heavier stew than the Italian pasta sauce, but is otherwise served in a similar manner as the rice. Grilled meats are frequently eaten with the pasta.\nDjiboutian cuisine is commonly prepared using many Middle Eastern spices, ranging from saffron to cinnamon. Spicy dishes come in many variations, from the traditional fah-fah or soupe Djiboutienne (spicy boiled beef soup), to the yetakelt wet (spicy mixed vegetable stew). Popular side dishes are lentils and rice, which are typically covered with sauces, such as the hot berbere or the buttery niter kibbeh.\n\n## Snacks and sweets\n\nSambusa, the Somali version of the triangular samosa snack, is commonly eaten throughout Djibouti during the afur (iftar). The local variant is spiced with hot green chili pepper, and the main ingredient is often ground meat (usually goat) or fish. Xalwo (pronounced \"halwo\") or halva is a popular confection served during special occasions, such as Eid celebrations or wedding receptions.\nGaroobey is one of the staple dishes of Djibouti. It is a porridge prepared by soaking oats in milk, and is flavored with cumin or other spices. Bajiyos, the Somali version of the Indian pakora, are a regular fixture at the table and in street shops, particularly when it is time to break the fast during Ramadan. They are part of the four essential elements of the Djiboutian afternoon tea. Fruits such as mango (cambo), guava (seytuun), and banana (moos) are also eaten throughout the day as snacks.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Dosa (food)\n\nA dosa (in Indian English) or thosai (in Malaysian English and Singapore English) is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar.\n\n## History\nThe dosa originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown.  According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the first century CE. However, according to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in Karnataka. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in the eighth-century literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, while the earliest mention of dosaë in Kannada literature appears a century later.\nIn popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants. The Karnataka dosa is traditionally softer and thicker; the thinner and crispier version of dosa, which became popular across India, was first made in present-day Tamil Nadu. A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.\nThe dosa arrived in Mumbai with the opening of Udupi restaurants in the 1930s. After India's independence in 1947, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in North India. In New Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine.\nDosas, like many other dishes of South Indian cuisine, were introduced in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) by South Indian emigrants during British rule. Tirunelveli and Tuticorin merchants who settled there were instrumental in the spreading of South Indian cookery across the island by opening restaurants (vegetarian hotels) to meet initially the needs of the emigrant population. Dosa has found its way into the culinary habits of the Sri Lankan people, where it has evolved into an island-specific version which is quite distinct from the Indian dosa. In both forms, it is called those (තෝසේ or [t̪oːse]) or thosai (தோசை or [t̪oːsaɪ̯]) in Sinhala and in Sri Lankan Tamil.\nIn Odisha, Chakuli Pithas are made which are quite similar to Dosa, but they are served flat or with single fold, but Dosas are arranged in different styles. Also, they aren't filled with stuffings unlike Dosa. There is a variation, such as Budha Chakuli, where fruits, raisins, grated coconut and jaggery are added to the batter. Also, Chakuli Pithas are not served with Chutney and Sambhar but wide ranging accompaniments, such as any Bhaja/Tarkari/Dalma or simple ones like Jaggery/Sugar. The batter consists of less rice than gram (biri).\nAs in Sri Lanka, dosa was introduced far abroad since the early 18th century, by the migration of the Indian Tamil diaspora to Southeast Asia and later in the Western world, and through the worldwide popularisation of Indian and Sri Lankan cuisines since the second half of the 20th century.\n\n## Names\nDosa is the anglicised name of a variety of South Indian names for the dish, for example, dosai in Tamil, dōsaë in Tulu, dōse in Kannada, dōsa in Telugu, dosha in Malayalam and Chakuli Pitha in Odia.\nThe standard transliterations and pronunciations of the word in various South Indian languages are:\n\nThe Tamil term தோசை dōsai lends to thosai as used in Malaysian English and Singapore English mentioned above.\n\n## Nutrition\nDosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is a good source of protein. A typical homemade plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% is protein. The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.\n\n## Preparation\nA mixture of rice and white gram that has been soaked in water for at least 4–5 hours is ground finely to form a batter. Some add a bit of soaked fenugreek seeds while grinding the batter. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. After adding salt, the batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava or griddle greased with oil or ghee. It is spread out with the base of a ladle or a bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of white grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.\n\n## Serving\nDosas can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side dish, which varies according to regional and personal preferences. Common side items are:\n\nSambar\nChutney\nIdli podi or milagaipodi: A lentil powder with spices and sometimes desiccated coconut, mixed with sesame oil or groundnut oil or ghee\nIndian pickles\n\n## Variations\nMasala dosa is a roasted dosa served with potato curry, chutney, and sambar, while saada (plain) dosa is prepared with a lighter texture; paper dosa is a thin and crisp version. Rava dosa is made crispier using semolina. Newer versions include Chinese dosa, cheese dosa, paneer dosa, and pizza dosa.\nThough dosa is typically made with rice and lentils, other versions exist.\n\n## World record\nOn 16 November 2014, 29 chefs, at Hotel Daspalla in Hyderabad, India, created a dosa that was 16.68 m (54.7 ft) long and weighed 13.69 kg (30.2 lb), earning the Guinness World Record for the longest dosa.\n\n## In popular culture\nIn a November 2019 video promoting her campaign for presidency, United States Vice President Kamala Harris cooked masala dosa with actress and comedian Mindy Kaling.\nThe 2023 Tamil culture-inspired cooking video game Venba features dosa as an in-game recipe.\n\n## Related foods\nUttapam: a thick relatively soft crepe mostly topped with diced onions, tomatoes, cilantro or cheese, sometimes described as an Indian pizza\nPesarattu: made from green gram in Andhra Pradesh, served with a ginger and tamarind chutney\nAppam: a pancake prepared from patted rice batter, served with sweet coconut milk or sugar\nChakuli pitha: the batter contains more black gram and less rice flour\nApam balik: made from a mixture of flour, eggs, sugar, baking soda, coconut milk and water\nJianbing: a Chinese dish\nBánh xèo: a Vietnamese dish\nLahoh: a Somali dish\nInjera: an Ethiopian dish made with fermented teff batter\n\n## See also\n\nList of fermented foods\nList of Indian breads\nList of pancakes\nUdupi cuisine\nCuisine of Kerala\nSouth Indian cuisine\nThali\n\n\n== References ==",

Duckling nominally comes from a juvenile animal, but may be simply a menu name.\nOne species of freshwater duck, the mallard, has been domesticated; the domesticated duck is a common livestock bird in a variety of cultures.  The Pekin duck is another livestock breed of importance, particularly in North America.  Magret refers specifically to the breast of a moulard or Muscovy (or Barbary) duck that has been force-fed to produce foie gras.\n\n## Duck meat\nDuck is particularly predominant in the Chinese cuisine—a popular dish is Peking duck. Duck meat is commonly eaten with scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce wrapped in a small spring pancake made of flour and water or a soft, risen bun known as gua bao. In Cantonese cuisine, the roasted duck or siu aap (燒鴨) is produced by siu mei barbecue shops; siu aap is offered whole or in halves, and commonly as part of take-out with steamed white rice and vegetables. Siu aap can also be served as part of the barbecue platter appetizer (the first of a ten-course Chinese banquet meal) in combination with char siu (roasted pork), soy sauce chicken, yu chu (roasted suckling pig) or siu yuk (roasted pig belly), and jellyfish.\nDuck meat is also a part of Indian cuisine, especially important in Northeast India, such as in the Assamese cuisine. The old Assamese text Kamarupa Yatra discusses duck meat, squab and tortoise meat. Popular dishes include duck with white gourd, duck with laixak and duck with bamboo shoots. Duck meat and squab are also cooked with banana blossoms. It is popular among both the tribal and non-tribal populations.\nThe Pekin duck is the most common duck meat consumed in the United States, and according to the USDA, about 39 million ducks are raised each year for meat. Because most commercially raised Pekins come from Long Island, New York, Pekins are also sometimes called \"Long Island\" ducks, despite being of Chinese origin. Some specialty breeds have become more popular in recent years, notably the Muscovy duck and the mulard duck (a sterile hybrid of Pekins and Muscovies). Unlike most other domesticated ducks, Muscovy ducks are not descended from mallards.\n\n## Duck egg\n\n\n## Nutrition\nDuck meat is very high in cholesterol and fat, particularly saturated fat.  It is also very high in protein and iron.\n\n## Duck dishes\nDuck is used in a variety of dishes around the world, most of which involve roasting for at least part of the cooking process to aid in crisping the skin. Some dishes use parts of the duck as an ingredient along with other ingredients. Notable duck dishes include:\n\nAlmond pressed duck\nBallotine\nBalut is a developing bird embryo boiled and eaten from the shell. It is sold as street food in the Philippines and around Southeast Asia.\nBebek betutu – a traditional dish from Bali, Indonesia. The duck is seasoned with pungent roots and various herbs, wrapped with banana leaves, and roasted.\nChicken and duck blood soup\nDuck blood and vermicelli soup\nDuck confit – duck legs that have been cured (partly or fully) in salt, then marinated and poached in duck fat, typically with garlic and other herbs. The French word confit means \"preserved\", and the French name for duck confit is \"confit de canard\".\nCzernina – a sweet and sour Polish soup made of duck blood and clear poultry broth. It was considered a symbol of Polish culture until the 19th century, customarily served to young men and even featured as a plot device in the epic poem Pan Tadeusz.\nDuck à l'orange – a classic French dish in which the duck is roasted and served with an orange sauce\nDuck rice – a traditional Singaporean dish made of braised or roast duck and white rice\nDuck bamboo curry – a traditional dish of Sylhet region in Bangladesh\nDuck bhuna - a popular food in Bangladesh with several variants. Some of them are cooked with coconut milk, and some use chui jhal to cook this item. It is served with rice or roti.\n\nFoie gras – a specially fattened and rich liver, or a pâté made from the liver, sometimes taken from a goose but usually from a duck\nLong Island roast duckling – a whole roasted bird, sometimes brined previously. When done properly, most of the fat melts off during the cooking process, leaving a crispy skin and well-done meat. Some restaurants on Long Island serve this dish with a cherry sauce.\nGuyanese duck curry\nGinger duck – Taiwanese medicinal hot pot made with duck and ginger\nKamo nanban – soba or udon with duck meat and leeks\nLemon duck\nNanjing salted duck\nOritang – a variety of guk, Korean soup made with duck and various vegetables\nPeking duck – a Chinese dish originating from Beijing, prepared since the Ming Dynasty era. It is prized for its thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, and eaten with pancakes, scallions, and hoisin sauce or sweet bean sauce.\nPressed duck – a complex dish originally from Rouen, France\nRouennaise sauce – prepared using puréed duck liver as an ingredient\nTiết canh\nTurducken – an American dish that comprises a turkey, stuffed with a duck, which is in turn stuffed with a chicken.\nWuhan duck\nYuhwang ori\nZhangcha duck – a quintessential dish of Sichuan cuisine, also called tea-smoked duck. It is prepared by smoking a marinated duck over tea leaves and twigs of the camphor plant, then steamed, and finally deep-fried.\n\n## Possibility of pollution contaminating wild duck\nAn article in The New York Times in 1981 reported that ducks caught in the wild may be contaminated from pollution of rivers and other bodies of water, because they eat fish and other aquatic life. In particular, PCBs may pose a health risk for those who eat wild duck frequently.\nIn February 2025, the Science of the Total Environment published a study of 108 unique specimens of waterfowl captured in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, between October 2021 and February 2022. This study, which included black ducks, wood ducks, green-winged teals, and Canada geese, discovered that consuming the breast tissue of waterfowl from the Northeast Atlantic Flyway once a year (over a lifetime) likely exposes the consumer to a cancer risk above de minimis. The study reports, \"Regardless of species, all samples contained detectable levels of PCBs and at least one OCP and PFAS. Mercury and OCPs posed limited non-cancer risks to human consumers who follow current waterfowl consumption advisories.\"\nIn September 2025, the state of Wisconsin warned against consuming mallard from lower Green Bay and to limit consuming mallard and wood ducks from the rest of the bay due to PFAS concerns.\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nRombauer, Irma S., et al.

    "text": "# Early modern European cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of early modern Europe (c. 1500–1800) was a mix of dishes inherited from medieval cuisine combined with innovations that would persist in the modern era.\nThe discovery of the New World, the establishment of new trade routes with Asia and increased foreign influences from sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East meant that Europeans became familiarized with a multitude of new foodstuffs. Spices that previously had been prohibitively expensive luxuries, such as pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger, soon became available to the majority population, and the introduction of new plants coming from the New World and India like maize, potato, sweet potato, chili pepper, cocoa, vanilla, tomato, coffee, and tea transformed European cuisine forever.\nThough there was a great influx of new ideas, an increase in foreign trade and a Scientific Revolution, preservation of foods remained traditional: preserved by drying, salting, and smoking or pickling in vinegar. Fare was naturally dependent on the season: a cookbook by Domenico Romoli called \"Panunto\" made a virtue of necessity by including a recipe for each day of the year. Everywhere both doctors and chefs continued to characterize foodstuffs by their effects on the four humours: they were considered to be heating or cooling to the constitution, moistening or drying.\nThere was a very great increase in prosperity in Europe during this period, which gradually reached all classes and all areas, and considerably changed the patterns of eating. Nationalism was first conceived in the early modern period, but it was not until the 19th century that the notion of a national cuisine emerged. Class differences were far more important dividing lines, and it was almost always upper-class food that was described in recipe collections and cookbooks.\n\n## Background\nThe culinary fashion of European elites changed considerably in this period. Typically medieval spices like galangal and grains of paradise were no longer seen in recipes. Updated recipes still had the strong acidic flavors of earlier centuries, but by the 1650s new innovative recipes blending subtle savory flavors like herbs and mushrooms could be found in Parisian cookbooks.\n\n## Meals\nThe three-meal-regimen so common today did not become a standard until well into the modern era.\nIn most parts of Europe, two meals per day were eaten, one in the early morning to noon and one in the late afternoon or later at night. The exact times varied both by period and region. In Spain and in parts of Italy such as Genoa and Venice the early meal was the lighter one while supper was heavier. In the rest of Europe, the first meal of the day was the more substantial. Throughout the period, there was a gradual shift in mealtimes. The shift was mainly influenced by cultural norms. Still, to the circumstances of an earlier age: people got up earlier in the agricultural society without electrical lighting. Since most people were working in the fields they needed a lot of energy throughout the day, which meant that they needed to eat a large meal in the middle of the day to keep their energy up. The first meal, then called dinner in English, moved from before noon to around 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon by the 17th century. The word supper came from the French but it is also slightly related to the Scandinavian and German words for soup, suppe, and suppa. These dinner times began to change for the European upper class especially when there were wars in the 1600s and power was strengthened through kings and other sorts of government. These people in power noticed that since they could very easily afford entertainment and the new expensive lights for their time this would allow them to party way longer than ever before. Therefore, pushed their dinner times to a few hours. In the middle of the 18th century, it could be held as late as 5:00 or 6:00. This necessitated a midday meal, luncheon, later shortened to lunch, which was established by the late century. Lunch became a standard for everyday life at the end of the 18th century. The word luncheon directly means a light repast between mealtimes which now relates to the modern English “tea” times. Now this is a light snack between lunch and dinner but in the early modern times, it was lunch that was a light snack between breakfast and dinner. It was only in the nineteenth century that the full three meals a day became quite popular. This was mostly popular among the more wealthy but it did gain some popularity in the less wealthy as well.\nBreakfast does not receive much attention in any sources.  As in the Middle Ages, breakfast in the sense of an early morning meal, is largely absent from the sources. It's unclear if this meant it was universally avoided or that it simply was not fashionable enough to be mentioned, as most sources were written by, for, and about the upper class. There is no doubt that working people since medieval times ate some sort of morning meal, but it is unclear exactly at what time and what it consisted of. Peasants in the early modern world commonly ate a diet that consisted of \"gruels, pottages, and ... grains\". Breakfast, when it began to be fashionable, was usually just a coffee, tea or chocolate, and did not become a more substantial meal in many parts of Europe until the 19th century. In the south, where supper was the largest meal, there was less need for breakfast, and it therefore remained unimportant, something that can still be seen today in the traditionally light breakfasts of southern Europe, which usually consists of coffee or tea with bread or pastry.\n\n## Foods\n\n\n### Cereals\nFor most of Europe, the many varieties of grain were the most important crop and formed the daily staple for segments of society. The differentiation was in the varieties, its quality and how it was prepared. The lower classes ate bread that was coarse and of considerably higher bran content while the upper classes enjoyed the finely ground, white wheat flour that most modern Europeans are used to. Wheat was considerably more expensive than other grains, and rarely eaten by many. Most bread was made with a mixture of wheat and other grains.\nGrain remained the undisputed main staple of early modern Europe until the 17th century. By this time the skepticism towards New World imports such as potatoes and maize had softened among the general populace, and the potato in particular found new appreciation in northern Europe, where it was a much more productive and flexible crop than wheat. In Ireland, this would later have disastrous results. In the early 19th century, when much of the country depended almost exclusively on potato, the potato blight, a fungus that rotted the edible tubers of the potato plant while still in the ground, caused a massive famine that killed over a million people and forced another two million to emigrate. In regions of Europe such as Scotland, Scandinavia, and northern Russia, the climate and soil types were less suited for wheat cultivation, and rye and barley were far more important. Rye was used to bake the dense, dark bread that is still common in countries like Sweden, Russia, and Finland. Barley was more common in the north, and was often used to make beer.\nOats made up a considerable minority of the produced grain but stood very low in status and was commonly used as animal feed, especially for horses. Millet, grown in much of Europe since prehistoric times was still used throughout much of the early period, but had largely disappeared by the 18th century although its exceptional storage period of up to twenty years meant it was used for emergency reserves. For example, the Italian dish polenta, previously made from millet, later was made with maize. Pasta had been a common food since the middle of the medieval period, and gained in popularity during the early modern period (notably in Naples, where it was not often seen until the late 18th century), but it was not yet usual to use the hard variety of durum wheat or semolina to make dried pasta until the Industrial era. Rice became established in many places, especially Italy and Spain, during the period, but was regarded as a low-status food; the well-off might occasionally have rice pudding but otherwise ignored it.\nPeas and beans, which made up a very large part of the diet of the medieval poor, were still often treated as a staple food, but to a diminishing extent over the period, to be replaced by cereals and the potato.\n\n### Meats\nEuropean consumption of meat remained exceptional by world standards, and during the period high levels generally moved down the social scale. But the poor continued to rely mainly on eggs, dairy products, and pulses for protein, though wild game and fish were caught and eaten in less populated regions. The richer nations, especially England, ate considerably more meat than the poorer ones. In some areas, especially Germany and the Mediterranean counties, the meat consumption of ordinary people actually declined, beginning in about 1550, and continuing throughout the period. Increasing population seem to lie behind this trend.\n\n### Fruits and vegetables\nFruits and vegetables that were introduced to Europe during this time include the tomato, chili pepper, and pumpkin (from the Americas) and the artichoke (from the Mediterranean). Additionally, while wild strawberry had existed, the modern garden strawberry was domesticated in France in the late 18th century from varieties found in the Americas.\nThe innovation and popularization of the orangery, an early form of greenhouse, in the 17th century enabled the growing or wintering of fruiting plants that would otherwise be unable to survive the climate of more northerly locations in Europe. This enabled the wealthy to have access to fresh oranges, lemons, limes, and even pineapples prior to the advent of refrigerated transport.\n\n### Fats\nA map of Early Modern Europe could be drawn based on the characteristic fats that predominated: olive oil, butter and lard. These kitchen staples had not changed since Roman times, but the onset of the Little Ice Age that coincided with Early Modern Europe affected the northernmost regions where olives would flourish. Only olive oil was a subject of long-distance trade.\n\n### Sugar\nCane sugar, native to India, was already known in Europe in the Middle Ages, expensive and mainly regarded as a medicine. From the end of the 17th century, greatly increased New World production struggled to meet the increase in European demand, so that by the end of the period the maritime nations of England, France, the Low and Iberian Countries were consuming large quantities, but other parts of Europe used it far less. At the same time, modern distinctions between sweet and savoury dishes were becoming general; meat dishes were much less likely to be sweetened than in the Middle Ages.\n\n## Drink\nWater as a neutral table beverage did not appear in Europe until well into the Industrial era, when efficient water purification could ensure safe drinking water. All but the poorest drank mildly alcoholic drinks on a daily basis, for every meal; wine in the south, beer in the north, east, and middle Europe. Both drinks came in many varieties, vintages, and at varying qualities. Those northerners who could afford to do so drank imported wines, and wine remained an integral part of the Eucharist, even for the poor. Ale had been the most common form of beer in England through most of the Middle Ages, but was mostly replaced with hopped beer from the Low Countries in the 16th century.\n\n### Wine\nShifting trade patterns and political events resulted in the growth of new regional wine industries and winemaking traditions. It saw the rise of sparkling Champagne, Madeira wine, Sack, and fortified Port wine. In England, repeated wars with France resulted in regular disruptions of trade and thus difficulties importing French wines. Following the Methuen Treaty of 1703 between England and Portugal, which favorably taxed Portuguese wines, England became increasingly reliant instead on Portuguese imports.\n\n### Spirits\nThe art of distillation was perfected in Europe during the 15th century, and many of today's most common and familiar spirits were invented and perfected before the 18th century.\nBrandy (from Low German Brandwein via Dutch brandewijn, meaning \"distilled wine\") first appeared in 15th-century Germany. When the English and Dutch were in fierce competition for the control of the lucrative European export market, the Dutch encouraged wine growing outside the Bordeaux area, where the English had strong connections. The result that the regions of Cognac and Armagnac became famous for producing high-quality brandy. Whisky and schnapps were produced in small household stills. Whisky became fashionable, commercialised, and exported in the 19th century. Gin, grain liquor flavored with juniper, was invented by the Dutch and commercial production by Lucas Bols began in the mid-17th century. The production was later refined in England and became immensely popular among the English working classes, ultimately resulting in the Gin Craze of the early 18th century.\nIn the triangular trade which began in the 16th and 17th century between Europe, North America and the Caribbean, rum was one of the most important commodities. It was made from molasses and was one of the most important products made from the sugar grown on the Caribbean Islands and in Brazil. In Britain, punch developed as a result of various influences, and was popularized during this time.\n\n### Coffee, tea and chocolate\nBefore the Early modern period, the social drinks of Europe had all been alcoholic. With the increased contact with Asia and Africa and the discovery of the Americas meant that Europeans came into contact with tea, coffee, and drinking chocolate. But it was not until the 17th century that all three products became popular as social beverages. The new drinks contained caffeine or theobromine, both mild stimulants that are not intoxicating in the same way as alcohol. Chocolate was the first drink to gain popularity, and was one of the preferred drinks of the Spanish nobility in the 16th and early 17th century. All three remained very expensive throughout the early modern period.\n\n## National cuisines\nAs nations began to form in Europe, the foundations of cuisine had begun to form. Although nationalization of many of today's European nations had not occurred in early modern Europe, many of the characteristics that establish a national cuisine began to emerge. These attributes included attributes such as the emergence of professional chefs, professional kitchens, the printing of codified culinary texts, and educated diners.\n\n### Italy\nIn Italy, a didactic switch occurred during the early modern era which changed the cuisine from one of high court cuisine, to a regional local cuisine by the end of the era. In the beginning of the era the courts of Florence, Rome, Venice, and Ferrara were an integral component to the creation of fine cooking in Italy with the court of Estes in Ferrara a central figure to the creation of this high-cuisine. A number of chefs were integral to this process, including Cristoforo di Messisbugo, steward to Ippolito d'Este, published Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande in 1549, which detailed banquets in the first half of the book, while the second half of the book featured a multitude of recipes for items such as pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings).\nIn 1570, Opera dell'arte del cucinare was written by Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to Pope Pius V, a five-volume work which to that date encompassed the most comprehensive example of Italian cooking. The work contained over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. Opera was an important text as it is seen as one of the first integral works which shed game meats in favor of domesticated animals. Additionally \"alternative\" cuts of animals such as tongue, head, and shoulder appear in recipes. Seasonality to fish and seafood dishes was also featured along with emphasis on Lenten cookery. Opera also featured an early version of the Neapolitan pizza, however, it was a sweet concoction unlike today's savory dish. Turkey and maize also appear for a first time in Italy in this book.\nUnlike France's continued path toward high-cuisine, Italy began to show a change toward regionalism and simple cooking in the late 17th century. In 1662 the last cookbook on Italian high-cuisine was published by Bartolomeo Stefani chef to Gonzagas. L'Arte di Ben Cucinare introduced vitto ordinario (\"ordinary food\") to Italian cookery. In turn, at the beginning of the 18th century, the cookery books of Italy began to show the regionalism of Italian cuisine in order for Italian chefs to better show the pride of their regions instead of the high cuisine of France. These books were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to bourgeois housewives who could address their home cook. Originating in booklet form, periodicals such as La cuoca cremonese (The cook of Cremona) written in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency, while the price to attain them dropped well within the reach of the general populace.\n\n### France\nIn France, shift came from the specialization of culinary skills by-way-of guilds. The two major separations of guilds were between those who supplied raw products and those who prepared them. Guilds specialized in specific forms of cookery included bakers, pastrycooks, saucemakers, poulterers, and caterers. It was through this specialization that many of the well-known French dishes of today began to take hold, but it was not until the 17th century that France's haute cuisine would begin codification with La Varenne the author of works such as Cvisinier françois and Le Parfait confitvrier, he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers.\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the New World. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show Catherine de' Medici serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner. The dish called cassoulet has its roots in the New World discovery of haricot beans, which are central to the dish's creation but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by Christopher Columbus.\nIt was during this era that coulis and roux first became part of the standard repertoire of French cooking techniques.\n\n## Legacy\nThe end of the 18th century (and with it the Early Modern era) saw and coincided with several major advancements that would change European foodways as it entered the modern industrial era. First was the introduction of the first modern public restaurant in Paris in the 1780s. Following the French Revolution, the dissolution of the Ancien Régime led the former cooks for the aristocracy to turn to new clients, either elsewhere in Europe or with the general public in France, accelerating the growth of restaurant culture. Second, around 1800, Count Rumford developed early designs for a new form of efficient kitchen stove, distinct from the traditional simple kitchen fireplace; which later in the 19th century would be mass-produced in cast-iron and become the new center of the kitchen and cooking.\nThrough the influence of colonization and emigration, early modern European cuisine would be foundational to the cuisines of the early United States and Canada, and play a significant role in the foodways of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the West Indies. At the same time, the influence of indigenous ingredients and foodways more suited to the local environment, together with the impact of foodways brought by enslaved Africans, and growing national identities as a result of the decolonization of the Americas from the 1780s to the 1830s would lead to culinary traditions that diverged from their respective European roots, and from subsequent developments there.\n\n## See also\nTudor food and drink\nCategory:Early modern cookbooks\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\nAlbala, Ken.

There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens.\n\n## History\nBird eggs have been valuable foodstuffs since prehistory, in both hunting societies and more recent cultures where birds were domesticated. The chicken was most likely domesticated for its eggs (from jungle fowl native to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia and Indian subcontinent) before 7500 BCE. Chickens were brought to Sumer and Egypt by 1500 BCE, and arrived in Greece around 800 BCE, where the quail had been the primary source of eggs. In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the pelican, as offerings. In ancient Rome, eggs were preserved using a number of methods and meals often started with an egg course. The Romans crushed the shells in their plates to prevent evil spirits from hiding there. The Babylonian Talmud, a Jewish work from late antiquity, states, \"A soft-boiled egg is better than six logs of farina.\"\nIn the Middle Ages, eggs were forbidden during Lent because of their richness, although the motivation for forgoing eggs during Lent was not entirely religious. An annual pause in egg consumption allowed farmers to rest their flocks, and also to limit their hens' consumption of feed during a time of year when food stocks were usually scarce.\nEggs scrambled with acidic fruit juices were popular in France in the seventeenth century; this may have been the origin of lemon curd.\n\nThe dried egg industry developed in the nineteenth century, before the rise of the frozen egg industry. In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and egg white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process. The production of dried eggs significantly expanded during World War II, for use by the United States Armed Forces and its allies.\nIn 1911, the egg carton was invented by Joseph Coyle in Smithers, British Columbia, to solve a dispute about broken eggs between a farmer in Bulkley Valley and the owner of the Aldermere Hotel. Early egg cartons were made of paper. Polystyrene egg cartons became popular in the latter half of the twentieth century as they were perceived to offer better protection especially against heat and breakage, however, by the twenty-first century environmental considerations have led to the return of more biodegradable paper cartons (often made of recycled material) that once again became more widely used.\nWhereas the wild Asian fowl from which domesticated chickens are descended typically lay about a dozen eggs each year during the breeding season, several millennia of selective breeding have produced domesticated hens capable of laying more than three hundred eggs each annually, and to lay eggs year round.\n\n## Varieties\nBird eggs are a common food and one of the most versatile ingredients used in cooking. They are important in many branches of the modern food industry.\nThe most commonly used bird eggs are those from the chicken, duck, and goose. Smaller eggs, such as quail eggs, are used occasionally as a gourmet ingredient in Western countries. Eggs are a common everyday food in many parts of Asia, such as China and Thailand, with Asian production providing 59 percent of the world total in 2013.\nThe largest bird eggs, from ostriches, tend to be used only as special luxury food. Gull eggs are considered a delicacy in England, as well as in some Scandinavian countries, particularly in Norway. In some African countries, guineafowl eggs often are seen in marketplaces, especially in the spring of each year. Pheasant eggs and emu eggs are edible, but less widely available; sometimes they are obtainable from farmers, poulterers, or luxury grocery stores. In many countries, wild bird eggs are protected by laws which prohibit the collecting or selling of them, or permit collection only during specific periods of the year.\n\n## Production\nIn 2017, world production of chicken eggs was 80.1 million tonnes. The largest producers were China with 31.3 million of this total, the United States with 6.3 million, India at 4.8 million, Mexico at 2.8 million, Japan at 2.6 million, and Brazil and Russia with 2.5 million each. The largest egg factory in British Columbia, for example, ships 12 million eggs per week.\n\nFor the month of January 2019, the United States produced 9.41 billion eggs, with 8.2 billion for table consumption and 1.2 billion for raising chicks. Americans are projected to each consume 279 eggs in 2019, the highest since 1973, but less than the 405 eggs eaten per person in 1945.\nDuring production, eggs can be candled to check their quality. The size of an egg's air cell is determined, and if fertilization took place three to six days or earlier prior to the candling, blood vessels can typically be seen as evidence that the egg contains an embryo. Contrary to common misconception, this is not conclusive evidence of fertilization, as blood vessels can just denote an ordinary rupture on the egg yolk surface while the egg was forming. Depending on local regulations, eggs may be washed before being placed in egg boxes, although washing may shorten their length of freshness.\n\n## Anatomy and characteristics\nBird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae (from the Greek word χάλαζα, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump'). The shape of a chicken egg resembles a prolate spheroid with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis.\n\n### Air cell\nThe larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during candling. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten, especially if a foul odor can be detected if the egg is cracked open.\n\n### Shell\nEggshell color is caused by pigment deposition during egg formation in the oviduct and may vary according to species and breed, from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green. The brown pigment is protoporphyrin IX, a precursor of heme, and the blue pigment is biliverdin, a product of the breakdown of heme. Generally, chicken breeds with white ear lobes lay white eggs, whereas chickens with red ear lobes lay brown eggs. Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value, often there is a cultural preference for one color over another (see § Color of eggshell below). As candling is less effective with brown eggs, they have a significantly higher incidence of blood spots.\n\n### Membrane\nThe eggshell membrane is a clear film lining the eggshell, visible when one peels a boiled egg. Primarily, it is composed of fibrous proteins such as collagen type I. These membranes may be used commercially as a dietary supplement.\n\n### White\n\"White\" is the common name for the clear liquid (also called the albumen or the glair/glaire) contained within an egg. Colorless and transparent initially, upon cooking it turns white and opaque. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen oviduct during the passage of the egg. It forms around both fertilized and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the embryo.\nEgg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent proteins (including albumins, mucoproteins, and globulins). Unlike the yolk, which is high in lipids (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the carbohydrate content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of vaccines, such as those for influenza.\n\n### Yolk\nThe yolk in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the vitelline membrane (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.\nYolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant pigments known as xanthophylls, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. Lutein is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk. A diet without such colorful foods may result in an almost colorless yolk. Yolk color is, for example, enhanced if the diet includes foods such as yellow maize and marigold petals. In the US, the use of artificial color additives is forbidden.\n\n### Abnormalities\nAbnormalities that have been found in eggs purchased for human consumption include:\n\nDouble-yolk eggs, when an egg contains two or more yolks, occurs when ovulation occurs too rapidly, or when one yolk becomes joined with another yolk.\nYolkless eggs, which contain whites but no yolk, usually occurs during a pullet's first effort, produced before her laying mechanism is fully ready.\nDouble-shelled eggs, where an egg may have two or more outer shells, is caused by a counter-peristalsis contraction and occurs when a second oocyte is released by the ovary before the first egg has completely traveled through the oviduct and been laid.\nShell-less or thin-shelled eggs may be caused by egg drop syndrome.\n\n## Culinary properties\n\n\n### Types of dish\nChicken eggs are widely used in many types of dish, both sweet and savory, including many baked goods. Some of the most common preparation methods include scrambled, fried, poached, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, omelettes, and pickled. They also may be eaten raw, although this is not recommended for people who may be especially susceptible to salmonellosis, such as the elderly, the infirm, or pregnant women. In addition, the protein in raw eggs is only 51 percent bioavailable, whereas that of a cooked egg is nearer 91 percent bioavailable, meaning the protein of cooked eggs is nearly twice as absorbable as the protein from raw eggs.\nAs a cooking ingredient, egg yolks are an important emulsifier in the kitchen, and are also used as a thickener, as in custards.\nThe albumen (egg white) contains protein, but little or no fat, and may be used in cooking separately from the yolk. The proteins in egg white allow it to form foams and aerated dishes. Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light, fluffy consistency, and often are used in desserts such as meringues and mousse.\nGround eggshells sometimes are used as a food additive to deliver calcium. Every part of an egg is edible, although the eggshell is generally discarded. Some recipes call for immature or unlaid eggs, which are harvested after the hen is slaughtered or cooked, while still inside the chicken.\n\n### Cooking\nEggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white, and the temperature determines the gelling time. Egg yolk becomes a gel, or solidifies, between 61 and 70 °C (142 and 158 °F). Egg white gels at different temperatures: 60 to 73 °C (140 to 163 °F). The white contains exterior albumen which sets at the highest temperature. In practice, in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer.\nSalmonella is killed instantly at 71 °C (160 °F), but also is killed from 54.5 °C (130.1 °F), if held at that temperature for sufficiently long time periods. To avoid the issue of salmonella, eggs may be pasteurized in-shell at 57 °C (135 °F) for an hour and 15 minutes. Although the white then is slightly milkier, the eggs may be used in normal ways. Whipping for meringue takes significantly longer, but the final volume is virtually the same.\nIf a boiled egg is overcooked, a greenish ring sometimes appears around the egg yolk due to changes to the iron and sulfur compounds in the egg. It also may occur with an abundance of iron in the cooking water. Overcooking harms the quality of the protein. Chilling an overcooked egg for a few minutes in cold water until it is completely cooled may prevent the greenish ring from forming on the surface of the yolk.\nPeeling a cooked egg is easiest when the egg was put into boiling water as opposed to slowly heating the egg from a start in cold water.\nIn February 2025, scientists published research confirming that periodic cooking of an egg is the best way to preserve the distinct textures of each part of an egg as well as its nutritional value. The method requires alternating between boiling and lukewarm water: two minutes in 100 °C (212 °F) water, two minutes at 30 °C (86 °F), repeated eight times.\n\n### Flavor variations\nAlthough the age of the egg and the conditions of its storage have a greater influence, the bird's diet affects the flavor of the egg. For example, when a brown-egg chicken breed eats rapeseed (canola) or soy meals, its intestinal microbes metabolize them into fishy-smelling triethylamine, which ends up in the egg. The unpredictable diet of free-range hens will produce likewise, unpredictable egg flavors. Duck eggs tend to have a flavor distinct from, but still resembling, chicken eggs.\nEggs may be soaked in mixtures to absorb flavor. Tea eggs, a common snack sold from street-side carts in China, are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices, soy sauce, and black tea leaves to give flavor. Hard boiled eggs are cracked slightly before being simmered in the marinade for more flavor, also giving them their marble pattern.\n\n### Storage\nCareful storage of edible eggs is extremely important, as an improperly handled egg may contain elevated levels of Salmonella bacteria that may cause severe food poisoning. In the US, eggs are washed. This cleans the shell, but erodes its cuticle. The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of Salmonella.\nRefrigeration also preserves the taste and texture. In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration. In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.\n\n### Preservation\nThe simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with salt. Salt draws water out of bacteria and molds, which prevents their growth. The Chinese salted duck egg is made by immersing duck eggs in brine, or coating them individually with a paste of salt and mud or clay. The eggs stop absorbing salt after approximately a month, having reached osmotic equilibrium. Their yolks take on an orange-red color and solidify, but the white remains somewhat liquid. These often are boiled before consumption and are served with rice congee; the yolks are also used in mooncakes and other pastries.\n\nAnother method is to make pickled eggs, by boiling them first and immersing them in a mixture of vinegar, salt, and spices, such as ginger or allspice. Frequently, beetroot juice is added to impart a red color to the eggs. If the eggs are immersed in it for a few hours, the distinct red, white, and yellow colors may be seen when the eggs are sliced. If marinated for several days or more, the red color will reach the yolk. If the eggs are marinated in the mixture for several weeks or more, the vinegar will dissolve much of the shell's calcium carbonate and penetrate the egg, making it acidic enough to inhibit the growth of bacteria and molds. Pickled eggs made this way generally keep for a year or more without refrigeration.\n\nA century egg or hundred-year-old egg is preserved by coating an egg in a mixture of clay, wood ash, salt, lime, and rice straw for several weeks to several months, depending on the method of processing. After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor. The transforming agent in a century egg is its alkaline material, which gradually raises the pH of the egg from approximately 9 to 12 or more. This chemical process breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats of the yolk into simpler, flavorful ones, which in some way may be thought of as an \"inorganic\" version of fermentation.\n\n## Nutrition and health effects\nEgg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline. Due to their protein content, the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meat within the Food Guide Pyramid (now MyPlate). Under the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) system, they score the maximum value of 1.0, and under the Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) system, they are also classified as an excellent-quality protein source.\nA 50-gram (1.8 oz) medium/large chicken egg provides approximately 70 kilocalories (290 kJ) of food energy and 6 grams of protein.\nCooking methods affect the nutritional values of eggs. For example, a large whole chicken egg contains approximately 0.45 - 0.5 µg of vitamin B12, which is concentrated in the yolk. Different cooking methods retain varying amounts of this vitamin; scrambled eggs lose about 5%, lightly fried eggs 5 - 15%,  and hard-boiled up to 20%. Studies have also found that the average absorption of vitamin B12 from fried or boiled eggs is more than twice that from scrambled eggs. Eggs (boiled) supply several vitamins and minerals as significant amounts of the Daily Value (DV), including (per 100g) vitamin A (19% DV), riboflavin (42% DV), pantothenic acid (28% DV), vitamin B12 (46% DV), choline (60% DV), phosphorus (25% DV), zinc (11% DV) and vitamin D (15% DV).\nThe diet of laying hens also may affect the nutritional quality of eggs. For instance, chicken eggs that are especially high in omega-3 fatty acids are produced by feeding hens a diet containing polyunsaturated fats from sources such as fish oil, chia seeds, or flaxseeds. Pasture-raised free-range hens, which forage for their own food, also produce eggs that are relatively enriched in omega-3 fatty acids when compared to those of cage-raised chickens.\nA 2010 USDA study determined there were no significant differences of macronutrients in various chicken eggs.\nCooked eggs are easier to digest than raw eggs, as well as having a lower risk of salmonellosis.\n\n### Cholesterol and fat\nMore than half the calories found in eggs come from the fat in the yolk; 50 grams of chicken egg (the contents of an egg just large enough to be classified as \"large\" in the US, but \"medium\" in Europe) contains approximately five grams of fat. Saturated fat (palmitic, stearic, and myristic acids) makes up 27 percent of the fat in an egg. The egg white consists primarily of water (88 percent) and protein (11 percent), with no cholesterol and 0.2 percent fat.\nThere is debate over whether egg yolk presents a health risk. Some research suggests dietary cholesterol increases the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the body's cholesterol profile; whereas other studies show that moderate consumption of eggs, up to one a day, does not appear to increase heart disease risk in healthy individuals. Harold McGee argues that the cholesterol in the egg yolk is not what causes a problem, because fat (particularly saturated fat) is much more likely to raise cholesterol levels than the consumption of cholesterol.\n\n### Type 2 diabetes\nStudies have shown conflicting results about a possible connection between egg consumption and type 2 diabetes.\nA meta-analysis from 2013 found that eating four eggs per week was associated with a 29 percent increase in the relative risk of developing diabetes. Another meta-analysis from 2013 also supported the idea that egg consumption may lead to an increased incidence of type two diabetes. A 2016 meta-analysis suggested that association of egg consumption with increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes may be restricted to cohort studies from the United States.\nA 2020 meta-analysis found that there was no overall association between moderate egg consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes and that the risk found in US studies was not found in European or Asian studies.\n\n### Cancer\nA 2015 meta-analysis found an association between higher egg consumption (five a week) with increased risk of breast cancer compared to no egg consumption. Another meta-analysis found that egg consumption may increase ovarian cancer risk.\nA 2019 meta-analysis found an association between high egg consumption and risk of upper aero-digestive tract cancers in hospital-based case-control studies.\nA 2021 review did not find a significant association between egg consumption and breast cancer. A 2021 umbrella review found that egg consumption significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer.\n\n### Cardiovascular health\nOne systematic review and meta-analysis of egg consumption found that higher consumption of eggs (more than 1 egg/day) was associated with a significant reduction in risk of coronary artery disease. Another systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary cholesterol and egg consumption found that egg consumption was associated with an increased all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. These contrary results may be due to somewhat different methods of study selection and the use primarily of observational studies, where confounding factors are not controlled.\nA 2018 meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials found that consumption of eggs increases total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C and HDL-C compared to no egg-consumption but not to low-egg control diets. In 2020, two meta-analyses found that moderate egg consumption (up to one egg a day) is not associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk. A 2020 umbrella review concluded that increased egg consumption is not associated with cardiovascular disease risk in the general population. Another umbrella review found no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disorders.\nA 2013 meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and heart disease or stroke. A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease mortality, but did find egg consumption of more than once daily increased cardiovascular disease risk 1.69-fold in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared to type 2 diabetics who ate less than one egg per week. Another 2013 meta-analysis found that eating four eggs per week increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by six percent.\nEggs are one of the largest sources of phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) in the human diet. A study published in the scientific journal, Nature, showed that dietary phosphatidylcholine is digested by bacteria in the gut and eventually converted into the compound TMAO, a compound linked with increased heart disease. Another study found that type 2 diabetes mellitus and kidney disease also increase TMAO levels and that evidence for a link between TMAO and cardiovascular diseases may be due to confounding or reverse causality.\n\n### Other\nEgg consumption does not increase hypertension risk. A 2016 meta-analysis found that consumption of up to one egg a day may contribute to a decreased risk of total stroke. Two recent meta-analyses found no association between egg intake and risk of stroke.\nA 2019 meta-analysis revealed that egg consumption has no significant effect on serum biomarkers of inflammation. A 2021 review of clinical trials found that egg consumption has beneficial effects on macular pigment optical density and serum lutein.\n\n### Contamination\nA health issue associated with eggs is contamination by pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella enteritidis. Contamination of eggs with other members of the genus Salmonella while exiting a female bird via the cloaca may occur, so care must be taken to prevent the egg shell from becoming contaminated with fecal matter. In commercial practice in the US, eggs are quickly washed with a sanitizing solution within minutes of being laid. The risk of infection from raw or undercooked eggs is dependent in part upon the sanitary conditions under which the hens are kept.\nHealth experts advise people to refrigerate washed eggs, use them within two weeks, cook them thoroughly, and never consume raw eggs. As with meat, containers and surfaces that have been used to process raw eggs should not come in contact with ready-to-eat food.\nA study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2002 (Risk Analysis April 2002 22(2):203-18) suggests the problem is not so prevalent in the U.S. as once thought. It showed that of the 69 billion eggs produced annually, only 2.3 million are contaminated with Salmonella—equivalent to just one in every 30,000 eggs—thus showing Salmonella infection is quite rarely induced by eggs. This has not been the case in other countries, however, where Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium infections due to egg consumption are major concerns.\nEgg shells act as hermetic seals that guard against bacteria entering, but this seal can be broken through improper handling or if laid by unhealthy chickens. Most forms of contamination enter through such weaknesses in the shell. In the UK, the British Egg Industry Council awards the lions stamp to eggs that, among other things, come from hens that have been vaccinated against Salmonella.\nIn 2017, authorities blocked millions of eggs from sale in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany because of contamination with the insecticide fipronil.\n\n### Food allergy\nOne of the most common food allergies in infants is eggs. Infants usually have the opportunity to grow out of this allergy during childhood, if exposure is minimized. Allergic reactions against egg white are more common than reactions against egg yolks. In addition to true allergic reactions, some people experience a food intolerance to egg whites. Food labeling practices in most developed countries now include eggs, egg products, and the processing of foods on equipment that also process foods containing eggs in a special allergen alert section of the ingredients on the labels.\n\n## Farming\nMost commercially farmed chicken eggs intended for human consumption are unfertilized, since the laying hens are kept without roosters. Fertile eggs may be eaten, with little nutritional difference when compared to the unfertilized. Fertile eggs will not contain a developed embryo, as refrigeration temperatures inhibit cellular growth for an extended period of time. Sometimes an embryo is allowed to develop, but eaten before hatching as with balut.\n\n### Grading by quality and size\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture grades eggs by the interior quality of the egg (see Haugh unit) and the appearance and condition of the egg shell. Eggs of any quality grade may differ in weight (size). Grade AA and Grade A eggs are best for frying and poaching, where appearance is important.\n\nU.S. Grade AA\nEggs have whites that are thick and firm; have yolks that are high, round, and practically free from defects; and have clean, unbroken shells.\nU.S. Grade A\nEggs have characteristics of Grade AA eggs except the whites are \"reasonably\" firm.\nThis is the quality most often sold in stores.\nU.S. Grade B\nEggs have whites that may be thinner and yolks that may be wider and flatter than eggs of higher grades. The shells must be unbroken, but may show slight stains.\nThis quality is seldom found in retail stores because usually they are used to make liquid, frozen, and dried egg products, as well as other egg-containing products.\nIn Australia and the European Union, eggs are graded by the hen raising method, free range, battery caged, etc.\nChicken eggs are graded by size for the purpose of sales. Some maxi eggs may have double-yolks and some farms separate out double-yolk eggs for special sale.\n\n### Color of eggshell\nAlthough eggshell color is a largely cosmetic issue, with no effect on egg quality or taste, it is a major issue in production due to regional and national preferences for specific colors, and the results of such preferences on demand. For example, in most regions of the United States, chicken eggs generally are white. However, brown eggs are more common in some parts of the Northeastern United States, particularly New England, where a television jingle for years proclaimed \"brown eggs are local eggs, and local eggs are fresh!\". Local chicken breeds, including the Rhode Island Red, lay brown eggs. Brown eggs are preferred in China, Costa Rica, Ireland, France, and the United Kingdom. In Brazil and Poland, white chicken eggs are generally regarded as industrial, and brown or reddish ones are preferred. Small farms and smallholdings, particularly in economically advanced nations, may sell eggs of widely varying colors and sizes, with combinations of white, brown, speckled (red), green, and blue (as laid by certain breeds, including araucanas, heritage skyline, and cream leg bar) eggs in the same box or carton, while the supermarkets at the same time sell mostly eggs from the larger producers, of the color preferred in that nation or region.\n\nThese cultural trends have been observed for many years. The New York Times reported during the Second World War that housewives in Boston preferred brown eggs and those in New York preferred white eggs. In February 1976, the New Scientist magazine, in discussing issues of chicken egg color, stated \"Housewives are particularly fussy about the colour of their eggs, preferring even to pay more for brown eggs although white eggs are just as good\". As a result of these trends, brown eggs are usually more expensive to purchase in regions where white eggs are considered \"normal\", due to lower production. In France and the United Kingdom, it is very difficult to buy white eggs, with most supermarkets supplying only the more popular brown eggs. By contrast, in Egypt it is very hard to source brown eggs, as demand is almost entirely for white ones, with the country's largest supplier describing white eggs as \"table eggs\" and packaging brown eggs for export.\nResearch conducted by a French institute in the 1970s demonstrated blue chicken eggs from the Chilean araucana fowl may be stronger and more resilient to breakage.\nResearch at Nihon University, Japan, in 1990 revealed that when Japanese housewives were deciding which eggs to buy, color was a distinct factor, with most Japanese housewives preferring the white color.\nEgg producers carefully consider cultural issues, as well as commercial ones, when selecting the breed or breeds of chickens used for production, as egg color varies between breeds. Among producers and breeders, brown eggs often are referred to as \"tinted\", while the speckled eggs preferred by some consumers often are referred to as being \"red\" in color.\n\n### Living conditions of birds\nCommercial factory farming operations often involve raising the hens in small, crowded cages, preventing the chickens from engaging in natural behaviors, such as wing-flapping, dust-bathing, scratching, pecking, perching, and nest-building. Such restrictions may lead to pacing and escape behavior.\nMany hens confined to battery cages, and some raised in cage-free conditions, are debeaked to prevent them from harming each other and engaging in cannibalism. According to critics of the practice, this can cause hens severe pain to the point where some may refuse to eat and starve to death. Some hens may be forced to molt to increase egg quality and production level after the molting. Molting can be induced by extended food withdrawal, water withdrawal, or controlled lighting programs.\nLaying hens often are euthanized when reaching 100 to 130 weeks of age, when their egg productivity starts to decline. Due to modern selective breeding, laying hen strains differ from meat production strains. As male birds of the laying strain do not lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production, they generally are killed soon after they hatch.\nFree-range eggs are considered by some advocates to be an acceptable substitute to factory-farmed eggs. Free-range laying hens are given outdoor access instead of being contained in crowded cages. Questions regarding the living conditions of free-range hens have been raised in the United States of America, as there is no legal definition or regulations for eggs labeled as free-range in that country.\nIn the United States, increased public concern for animal welfare has pushed various egg producers to promote eggs under a variety of standards. The most widespread standard in use is determined by United Egg Producers through their voluntary program of certification. The United Egg Producers program includes guidelines regarding housing, food, water, air, living space, beak trimming, molting, handling, and transportation, however, opponents such as The Humane Society have alleged UEP certification is misleading and allows a significant amount of unchecked animal cruelty. Other standards include \"Cage Free\", \"Natural\", \"Certified Humane\", and \"Certified Organic\". Of these standards, \"Certified Humane\", which carries requirements for stocking density and cage-free keeping and so on, and \"Certified Organic\", which requires hens to have outdoor access and to be fed only organic vegetarian feed and so on, are the most stringent.\nEffective 1 January 2012, the European Union banned conventional battery cages for egg-laying hens, as outlined in EU Directive 1999/74/EC. The EU permits the use of \"enriched\" furnished cages that must meet certain space and amenity requirements. Egg producers in many member states have objected to the new quality standards while in some countries, even furnished cages and family cages are subject to be banned as well. The production standard of the eggs is visible on a mandatory egg marking categorization where the EU egg code begins with 3 for caged chicken to 1 for free-range eggs and 0 for organic egg production.\n\n### Killing of male chicks\nIn all methods of egg production, unwanted male chicks are killed at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens. As of June 2023, this practice has been banned in Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy. Some egg producers have begun using in-ovo sexing to analyze the sex of a chick before it hatches, allowing them to remove male eggs from incubation and avoid chick culling. As of April 2025, five companies offer commercially available in-ovo sexing technology, which is used for 28 percent of the European layer population.\n\n## Cultural significance\nA popular Easter tradition in some parts of the world is a decoration of hard-boiled eggs (usually by dyeing, but often by spray-painting). A similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition (called Norouz), each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and they set them together in a bowl. In Northern Europe and North America, Easter eggs may be hidden by adults for children to find in an Easter egg hunt. They may be rolled in some traditions. In Eastern and Central Europe, and parts of England, easter eggs may be tapped against each other to see whose egg breaks first.\nSince the sixteenth century, the tradition of a dancing egg is held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities. It consists of a hollow eggshell, positioned over the water jet from a fountain, which causes the eggshell to revolve without falling.\n\n## See also\nEgg substitutes\nLists of foods\nList of egg dishes\nFish eggs\nYolkless egg\nHam and eggs\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nFact Sheet on FDA's Proposed Regulation: Prevention of Salmonella Enteritidis in Shell Eggs During Production (archived 17 June 2008)\nEgg Information U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011)\nEgg Basics for the Consumer: Packaging, Storage, and Nutritional Information Archived 25 May 2014 at the Wayback Machine.

It has distinctive attributes of its own, but is also very similar to wider British cuisine, partly historically and partly due to the import of ingredients and ideas from the Americas, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.\nSome traditional meals, such as bread and cheese, roasted and stewed meats, meat and game pies, boiled vegetables and broths with herbs or spices, and freshwater and saltwater fish have ancient origins. The 14th-century English cookbook, the Forme of Cury, contains recipes for these, and dates from the royal court of Richard II.\nEnglish cooking has been influenced by foreign ingredients and cooking styles since the Middle Ages. Curry was introduced from the Indian subcontinent and adapted to English tastes from the eighteenth century with Hannah Glasse's recipe for chicken \"currey\". French cuisine influenced English recipes throughout the Victorian era. After the rationing of the Second World War, Elizabeth David's 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food had wide influence, bringing the cuisine of that region to English homes. Her success encouraged other cookery writers to describe other styles, including Chinese and Thai cuisine. England continues to absorb culinary ideas from all over the world.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Middle Ages\nEnglish cooking has developed over many centuries since at least the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes using seasonings including nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, cardamon and cloves, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.\nInstead, medieval dishes often had the texture of a purée, possibly containing small fragments of meat or fish: 48% of the recipes in the Beinecke manuscript are for dishes similar to stews or purées. Such dishes could be broadly of three types: somewhat acidic, with wine, vinegar, and spices in the sauce, thickened with bread; sweet and sour, with sugar and vinegar; and sweet, using then-expensive sugar. An example of such a sweet purée dish for meat (it could also be made with fish) from the Beinecke manuscript is the rich, saffron-yellow \"mortruys\", thickened with egg:\n\nTake brawn of capons & porke, sodyn & groundyn; tempyr hit up with milk of almondes drawn with the broth. Set hit on the fyre; put to sigure & safron. When hit boyleth, tak som of thy milk, boylying, fro the fyre & aley hit up with yolkes of eyron that hit be ryght chargeaunt; styre hit wel for quelling. Put therto that othyr, & ster hem togedyr, & serve hem forth as mortruys; and strew on poudr of gynger.\nAnother manuscript, Utilis Coquinario, mentions dishes such as \"pyany\", poultry garnished with peonies; \"hyppee\", a rose-hip broth;  and birds such as cormorants and woodcocks.\n\n### Sixteenth century\nThe early modern period saw the gradual arrival of printed cookery books, though the first, the printer Richard Pynson's 1500 Boke of Cokery was compiled from medieval texts. The next, A Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye, was published sometime after 1545. The Secretes of the Reverende Maister Alexis of Piermont was published in 1558, translated from a French translation of Alessio Piemontese's original Italian work on confectionery. The number of titles expanded rapidly towards the end of the century to include Thomas Dawson's The Good Huswifes Jewell in 1585, the Book of Cookrye by \"A. W.\" in 1591, and John Partridge's The Good Hous-wives Handmaide in 1594. These books were of two kinds: collections of so-called secrets on confectionery and health remedies, aimed at aristocratic ladies; and advice on cookery and how to manage a household, aimed at women from more ordinary backgrounds, most likely wives of minor aristocrats, clergymen, and professional men.\n\nEnglish tastes evolved during the sixteenth century in at least three ways. First, recipes emphasise a balance of sweet and sour. Second, butter becomes an important ingredient in sauces, a trend which continued in later centuries. Third, herbs, which could be grown locally but had been little used in the Middle Ages, started to replace spices as flavourings. In A. W.'s Book of Cookrye, 35% of the recipes for meat stews and sauces include herbs, most commonly thyme. On the other hand, 76% of those meat recipes still used the distinctly mediaeval combination of sugar and dried fruit, together or separately. New ingredients were arriving from distant countries, too: The Good Huswifes Jewell introduced sweet potatoes (from the tropical Americas) alongside familiar medieval recipes.\nElinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book, compiled in 1604 (and first published in 1986) gives an intimate view of Elizabethan cookery. The book provides recipes for various forms of bread, such as buttered loaves; for apple fritters; preserves and pickles; and a celebration cake for 100 people. New ingredients appear; a recipe for dressing a shoulder of mutton calls for the use of the newly available citrus fruits:\n\nTake a showlder of mutton and being halfe Roasted, Cut it in great slices and save the gravie then take Clarret wine and sinamond & sugar with a little Cloves and mace beatne and the peel of an oringe Cut thin and minced very smale. Put the mutton the gravie and these thinges together and boyle yt between two dishes, wringe the juice of an oringe into yt as yt boyleth, when yt is boyled enough lay the bone of the mutton beinge first Broyled in the dish with it then Cut slices of limonds and lay on the mutton and so serve yt in.\n\nPies were important both as food and for show; the nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\", with its lines \"Four and Twenty blackbirds / Baked in a pie. // When the pie was opened, The birds began to sing\" refers to the conceit of placing live birds under a pie crust just before serving at a banquet.\n\n### Seventeenth century\nThe bestselling cookery book of the early seventeenth century was Gervase Markham's The English Huswife, published in 1615. It appears that his recipes were from the collection of a deceased noblewoman, and therefore dated back to Elizabethan times or earlier. Women were thus becoming both the authors of cookery books and their readers, though only about 10% of women in England were literate by 1640. Markham's recipes are distinctively different from mediaeval ones; three quarters of his sauces for meat and meat pies make use of a combination of sweet and sour, and he advises:\n\nWhen a broth is too sweet, to sharpen it with verjuice, when too tart to sweet it with sugar, when flat and wallowish to quicken it with orenge and lemmons, and when too bitter to make it pleasant with hearbes and spices.\nRobert May's The Accomplisht Cook was published in 1660 when he was 72 years old. The book included a substantial number of recipes for soups and stews, 38 recipes for sturgeon, and a large number of pies variously containing fish (including sturgeon), meat (including battalia pie), and sweet fillings.\nFrench influence is evident in Hannah Woolley's The Cooks Guide, 1664. Her recipes are designed to enable her non-aristocratic readers to imitate the fashionable French style of cooking with elaborate sauces. She combined the use of \"Claret wine\" and anchovies with more traditional cooking ingredients such as sugar, dried fruit, and vinegar.\nIn 1699, John Evelyn published Acetaria: A Discourse of Sallets, considered to be the first book on salads. It explores the philosophical significance of salads, reflecting 17th-century beliefs that spiritual purity could be regained through knowledge of nature.\n\n### Eighteenth century\nJohn Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), still with rather few precedents to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest. The book covered everything from soups and salads to meat and fish, as well as pastries of many kinds, confectionery, and the making of beer, cider, and wine. Bills of fare are given for each month of the year.\nThe anonymously published Primitive Cookery promoted economical lacto-vegetarian dishes, though some recipes included meat.\nJames Woodforde's Diary of a Country Parson gives a good idea of the sort of food eaten in England in the eighteenth century by those who were reasonably prosperous. To welcome some neighbours on 8 June 1781, he gave them for dinner:\n\na Couple of Chicken boiled and a Tongue, a Leg of Mutton boiled and Capers and Batter Pudding for the first Course, Second, a couple of Ducks rosted and green Peas, some Artichokes, Tarts and Blancmange. After dinner, Almonds and Raisins, Oranges and Strawberries, Mountain and Port Wines. Peas and Strawberries the first gathered this year by me. We spent a very agreeable day.\nAnother country clergyman, Gilbert White, in The Natural History of Selborne (1789) recorded the increased consumption of vegetables by ordinary country people in the south of England, to which, he noted, potatoes, from the Americas, had only been added during the reign of King George III:\n\nGreen-stalls in cities now support multitudes in comfortable state, while gardeners get fortunes. Every decent labourer also has his garden, which is half his support; and common farmers provide plenty of beans, peas, and greens, for their hinds to eat with their bacon.\nHannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy was the best-selling cookery book for a century from its publication in 1747. It ran to at least 40 editions, and was widely pirated.\n\n### Nineteenth century\nEnglish cooking was systematised and made available to the middle classes by a series of popular books, their authors becoming household names. One of the first was Mrs Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, 1806; it went through sixty-seven editions by 1844, selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Britain and America. This was followed by Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families 1845, which Bee Wilson has called \"the greatest cookery book in our language\", but \"modern\" only in a nineteenth-century sense.\nAn example recipe from Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families is her \"Quince Blanc-Mange (Delicious)\":\n\nDissolve in a pint of prepared juice of quinces an ounce of the best isinglass; next, add ten ounces of sugar, roughly pounded, and stir these together over a clear fire, from twenty to thirty minutes, or until the juice jellies in falling from the spoon. Remove the scum carefully, and pour the boiling jelly gradually to half a pint of thick cream, stirring them briskly together as they are mixed: they must be stirred until very nearly cold, and then poured into a mould which has been rubbed in every part with the smallest possible quantity of very pure salad oil, or if more convenient, into one that has been dipped into cold water.\nActon was supplanted by the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, substantially written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarised from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking for a series of aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.\nThree of the major hot drinks popular in England, tea, coffee, and chocolate, originated from outside Europe and were already staple items by Victorian times. Catherine of Braganza brought the Portuguese habit of tea to England around 1660. Initially, its expense restricted it to wealthy consumers, but the price gradually dropped, until by the 19th century its use was widespread. Introduced in the 16th century, coffee became popular by the 17th century, especially in the coffee houses, the first opening in Oxford in 1650. Hot chocolate was a popular drink by the 17th century, long before it was used as a food. Chocolate bars were developed and marketed by three English Quaker-founded businesses, Joseph Fry's (1847), Rowntree's (1862), and Cadbury's (1868).\n\n### Twentieth century\nAfter the First World War, many new food products became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships. Authors in the 1930s such as Lady Sysonby drew on recipes from a wide range of countries.\n\nRationing was introduced in 1940 to cope with the shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as dried egg, dried potato, whale meat, snook (a South African fish), and the tinned pork product Spam appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot fudge. The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that overall the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. The Ministry of Food employed home economists such as Marguerite Patten to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten became one of the first television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books.\n\nElizabeth David profoundly changed English cooking with her 1950 A Book of Mediterranean Food. Written at a time of scarcity, her book began with \"perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing\":\n\nThe cooking of the Mediterranean shores, endowed with all the natural resources, the colour and flavour of the South, is a blend of tradition and brilliant improvisation. The Latin genius flashes from the kitchen pans. It is honest cooking too; none of the sham Grand Cuisine of the International Palace Hotel\nAll five of David's early books remained in print half a century later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright was of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because David consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries which she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books paved the way for other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr (\"the galloping gourmet\"), and Robert Carrier.\n\n## \"Stereotypical\" English dishes\nIn 1953, Britain's first celebrity chef, Philip Harben, published Traditional Dishes of Britain. Its chapter titles simply listed \"the stereotypical stalwarts of the British diet\", from Cornish pasties, crumpets, and Yorkshire pudding to shortbread, Lancashire hotpot, steak and kidney pudding, jellied eels, clotted cream and fish and chips. Panayi noted that Harben began with contradictions and unsupported claims, naming Britain's supposed reputation for the worst food in the world, but claiming that the country's cooks were technically unmatched and that the repertoire of national dishes was the largest of any country's.\nThe sociologist Bob Ashley observed in 2004 that while people in Britain might agree that the core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed \"We're not allowed to do foreign food ... I can't do lasagne or anything like that\", in fact served curry, because \"seemingly curry is English\". Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed been part of the national diet since the eighteenth century.\nSome English dishes are relatively new and can be dated to the century, and sometimes to the year, of their introduction. Thus piccalilli was introduced from India in the 18th century, as recorded by Hannah Glasse who gave a recipe for it in 1758. Conversely, dishes and sauces still considered foreign, such as fish in sweet and sour sauce, have been in English recipe books since the Middle Ages. Other dishes took their present form only gradually, as with the so-called \"full English breakfast\". Breakfasts of this kind are indeed described in later editions of \"Mrs Beeton\", but as one of many variations. Thus her list of \"Family Breakfasts for a Week in Winter\" has for Wednesday something that looks fairly modern: \"bread, muffins, butter, brawn, grilled bacon, boiled eggs\"; but on other days less modern-looking breakfasts include mince, mutton cutlets, grilled kidneys, baked fresh herrings, and hash of cold game or poultry, while suggestions for \"Family Breakfasts for a Week in Summer\" included sardine toast, cold tongue, kedgeree and rissoles, and \"Guests' Breakfast (Autumn)\" included cold pheasant, game pie, and pressed beef.\n\n## Influences\nEnglish cookery has demonstrably been open to influences from abroad from as early as the thirteenth century, and in the case of a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.\nCradock asserted: \"The English have never had a cuisine. Even Yorkshire pudding comes from Burgundy.\" However, a recipe for \"a dripping pudding\" was published in the 1737 book The Whole Duty of a Woman.  Nicola Humble observed that in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, there are about the same number of recipes from India as from Wales, Scotland and Ireland together. Panayi created controversy by asserting, with evidence, that fish and chips had foreign origins: the fried fish from Jewish cooking and the potato chips from France; the dish only came to signify national identity from about 1930. French cuisine powerfully influenced English cooking throughout the nineteenth century, and French celebrity chefs such as the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc have continued to do so in twenty-first-century England.\n\n### The role of Empire\nCurry was created by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, beginning as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add \"bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats.\" Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, first published in 1747, contains what Dickson Wright calls a \"famous recipe\" which describes how \"To make a currey the Indian way\"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was \"a bit sceptical\" of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was \"pleasantly surprised by the result\" which had \"a very good and interesting flavour\".\nThe process of adapting Indian cooking continued for centuries. Anglo-Indian recipes could completely ignore Indian rules of diet, for example by using pork or beef. Some dishes, such as \"liver curry, with bacon\" were simply ordinary recipes spiced up with ingredients such as curry powder. In other cases like kedgeree, Indian dishes were adapted to British tastes; khichari was originally a simple dish of lentils and rice. Curry was accepted in almost all Victorian era cookery books, such as Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845): she offered recipes for curried sweetbreads and curried macaroni, merging Indian and European foods into standard English cooking. By 1895, curry was included in Dainty Dishes for Slender Incomes, aimed at the poorer classes.\nForeign influence was by no means limited to specific dishes. James Walvin, in his book Fruits of Empire, argues that potatoes, sugar (entirely imported until around 1900 and the growing of sugar beet), tea, and coffee as well as increasing quantities of spices were \"Fruits of Empire\" that became established in Britain between 1660 and 1800, so that by the nineteenth century \"their exotic origins had been lost in the mists of time\" and had become \"part of the unquestioned fabric of local life\".\n\n### Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine\nDuring the British Raj, Britain first started borrowing Indian dishes, creating Anglo-Indian cuisine, with dishes such as kedgeree (1790) and Mulligatawny soup (1791).  Indian food was served in coffee houses from 1809, and cooked at home from a similar date as cookbooks of the time attest. The Veeraswamy restaurant in Regent Street, London, was opened in 1926, at first serving Anglo-Indian food, and is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in Britain. There was a sharp increase in the number of curry houses in the 1940s, and again in the 1970s.\n\nThe post-colonial British Indian dish chicken tikka masala was apparently invented in Glasgow in the early 1970s, while balti cuisine was introduced to Britain in 1977 in Birmingham. In 2003, there were roughly 9,000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in Britain. The majority of Indian restaurants in Britain are run by entrepreneurs of Bangladeshi (often Sylhetis) and Pakistani origin. According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom was worth £3.2 billion in 2003, accounting for two-thirds of all eating out, and serving about 2.5 million British customers every week. The number of restaurants peaked at some 12,000 in 2015, decreasing to some 8,000 by 2023.\nIndian restaurants typically allow the diner to combine base ingredients — chicken, prawns or \"meat\" (lamb or mutton) — with curry sauces — from the mild korma to the scorching phall — without regard to the authenticity of the combination. The reference point for flavour and spice heat is the Madras curry sauce (the name represents the area of India where restaurateurs obtained their spices, rather than an actual dish). Other sauces are sometimes variations on a basic curry sauce: for instance, vindaloo is often rendered as a fiery dish of lamb or chicken in a Madras sauce with extra chilli, rather than the Luso-Indian dish of pork marinated in wine vinegar and garlic, based on a Goan Portuguese dish carne de vinha d'alhos.\nIndian restaurants and their cuisine in Britain gradually improved from the stereotypical flock wallpaper and standardised menus. One of the pioneers was the Bombay Brasserie, which opened in Gloucester Road, London, in 1982, serving the kind of food actually eaten in India. Vegetarian Indian restaurants opened in the 1980s in the Drummond Street area of Euston, London. In 1990 Chutney Mary followed in Chelsea. In 2001, two Indian restaurants in London, Tamarind (opened 1995) and Zaika (opened 1999) gained Michelin stars for the quality of their cooking.\nIndian cuisine is the most popular alternative to traditional cooking in Britain, followed by Chinese and Italian food. By 2015, chicken tikka masala was one of Britain's most popular dishes.\n\n### Southeast and East Asian cuisines\nSoutheast and East Asian cuisines have become widely available across England. Chinese cuisine became established in England by the 1970s, with large cities often having a Chinatown district; the one in London's Soho developed between the two world wars, following an informal area in Limehouse. Deriving from Cantonese cuisine, the food served by Chinese restaurants has been adapted to suit English taste. From around 1980 onwards, Southeast Asian cuisines, especially Thai and Vietnamese, began to gain popularity in England.\n\n### European cuisines\nItalian cuisine is the most popular Mediterranean cuisine in England. In its current form, inspired by Elizabeth David, its rise began after 1945. There were some Italian restaurants before World War II, but they mostly served a generalised haute cuisine. Soon after the war, Italian coffee bars appeared, the first places to trade on their Italian identity; they soon started to sell simple and cheap Italian food such as minestrone soup, spaghetti and pizza. From the early 1960s, the slightly more elegant trattoria restaurants offered \"Italian specialities\" such as lasagne verdi al forno (baked lasagne, coloured with spinach). Other Mediterranean influences include Greek moussaka, feta and taramasalata, Turkish doner and shish kebabs, and Middle Eastern hummus.\nFrench cuisine in England is largely restricted to expensive restaurants, although there are some inexpensive French bistros.\nFor many years, English writers including Hannah Glasse in the 18th century and Andrew Kirwan in the 19th century were ambivalent about French cooking. However, restaurants serving French haute cuisine developed for the upper and middle classes in England from the 1830s and Escoffier was recruited by the Savoy Hotel in 1890. Marcel Boulestin's 1923 Simple French Cooking for English Homes did much to popularise French dishes.\n\n## Food establishments\n\n\n### Cafes and tea shops\nThe English cafe is a small, inexpensive eating place. A working men's cafe serves mainly fried or grilled food, such as fried eggs, bacon, bangers and mash‚ black pudding, bubble and squeak, burgers, sausages, mushrooms and chips. These may be accompanied by baked beans, cooked tomatoes, and fried bread. These are referred to as \"breakfast\" even if they are available all day. Traditional cafes have declined with the rise of fast-food chains, but remain numerous all over the UK.\nA tea shop is a small restaurant that serves soft drinks and light meals, often in a sedate atmosphere. Customers may eat a cream tea in Cornish or Devonshire style, served from a china set, and a scone with jam and clotted cream.\n\n### Fish and chip shops\nFish and chips is a hot dish consisting of battered fish, commonly Atlantic cod or haddock, and chips. It is a common take-away food.\nWestern Sephardic Jews settling in England from the 16th century fried fish in the style of Spanish pescado frito, coated in flour and fried in oil. Chips appeared in the Victorian era; Dickens's 1859 A Tale of Two Cities mentions \"husky chips of potatoes, fried with some reluctant drops of oil\". Panayi states that fish and chip shops in the 1920s were often run by Jews or Italians. Despite this, the new dish was popularly attributed to France; The Times recorded that \"potatoes chipped and fried in the French manner were introduced in Lancashire with great success about 1871.\" The Fish Trades Gazette of 29 July 1922 stated that \"Later there was introduced into this country the frying and purveying of chip potatoes from France ... which had made the fried fish trade what it is today.\"\n\n### Pub food\nThe public house, or pub, is a famous English institution. In the mid-20th century, pubs were drinking establishments with little emphasis on the serving of food, other than \"bar snacks\", such as pork scratchings, pickled eggs, salted crisps, and peanuts, which helped to increase beer sales. If a pub served meals these were usually basic cold dishes such as a ploughman's lunch, invented in the 1950s.\nIn the 1950s some British pubs started to offer \"a pie and a pint\", with hot individual steak and ale pies made on the premises by the landlord or his wife. In the 1960s this was developed into the then-fashionable \"chicken in a basket\", a portion of roast chicken with chips, served on a napkin, in a wicker basket, by the Mill pub at Withington. Quality dropped but variety increased with the introduction of microwave ovens and freezer food. \"Pub grub\" expanded to include British food items such as steak and kidney pudding, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, and pasties. The gastropub movement of the 21st century, on the other hand, has sought to serve restaurant-quality food, cooked to order from fresh ingredients, in a pub setting; one pub, The Hand & Flowers in Marlow has been awarded two Michelin stars, and several have one star. In 1964, pubs were serving 9.1% of meals eaten outside the home; this rose rapidly to 37.5% by 1997.\n\n## Vegetarianism\nModern Western vegetarianism was founded in the United Kingdom in 1847 with the world's first Vegetarian Society. It has increased markedly since the end of World War II, when there were around 100,000 vegetarians in the country. By 2003 there were between 3 and 4 million vegetarians in the UK, one of the highest percentages in the Western world, while around 7 million people claim to eat no red meat. By 2015, 11 of 22 restaurant chains studied by the Vegan Society had at least one vegan main course on their menu, though only 6 of these explicitly labelled them as vegan dishes. Top-end vegetarian restaurants remain relatively few, though they are increasing rapidly: there were some 20 in Britain in 2007, rising to 30 in 2010.\n\n## Quality\nEnglish cuisine in the twentieth century suffered from a poor international reputation. Keith Arscott of Chawton House Library comments that \"at one time people didn't think the English knew how to cook and yet these [eighteenth and nineteenth century] female writers were at the forefront of modern-day cooking.\" English food was popularly supposed to be bland, but English cuisine has made extensive use of spices since the Middle Ages, introduced curry to Europe, and makes use of strong flavourings such as English mustard. It was similarly reputed to be dull, like roast beef, but that dish was highly prized both in Britain and abroad, and few people could afford it; the \"Roast Beef of Old England\" lauded by William Hogarth in his 1748 painting celebrated the high quality of English cattle, which the French at the \"Gate of Calais\" (the other name of his painting) could only look at with envy. The years of wartime shortages and rationing certainly did impair the variety and flavour of English food during the twentieth century, but the nation's cooking recovered from this with increasing prosperity and the availability of new ingredients from soon after the Second World War.\n\nIn 2005, 600 food critics writing for the British Restaurant magazine named 14 British restaurants among the 50 best restaurants in the world, the number one being The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, led by its chef Heston Blumenthal. The quality of London's best restaurants has made the city a leading centre of international cuisine.\nMeanwhile, the list of United Kingdom food and drink products with protected status (PDO) under European Union law has increased rapidly, with 59 items including Cornish sardines, Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese and Yorkshire forced rhubarb, Fenland celery, West Country lamb and beef and traditional Cumberland sausage listed as registered in 2015, and a further 13 including Birmingham Balti listed as applied for. By 2016 there were 12 cheeses from England with PDO status.\n\n## See also\nLeeds University Library's Cookery Collection\nList of English cheeses – over 700 varieties of cheese are produced in England\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nCarroll, R.

A kes only eats meat he has slaughtered himself, which his hosts then prepare both for him and themselves. \nBeta Israel who broke these taboos were ostracized and had to undergo a purification process.  Purification included fasting for one or more days, eating only uncooked chickpeas provided by the kes, and ritual purification before entering the village. Unlike other Ethiopians, the Beta Israel do not eat raw meat dishes such as kitfo or gored gored.\nGhee and niter kibbeh (types of clarified butter) are popular components of Ethiopian cuisine, including Ethiopian-Jewish cuisine. To avoid mixtures of meat and dairy, oil can be used as a parev substitute for clarified butter.\nBecause excess moisture is removed from ghee through heat treatment, the heating equipment must be verified as kosher as well, which adds an extra step to the kashering process. Ghee is commonly used in Middle Eastern cuisine and thus kosher ghee is widely available in Israel. Yeqimem zeyet is a form of niter kibbeh made from vegetable oil and is useful as a parev and vegan alternative to dairy-based niter kibbeh.\nCamel meat is traditionally eaten by Ethiopian Muslims, but it is not eaten by either Ethiopian Jews or Ethiopian Christians. Camels are not a kosher animal. Camel milk is commonly consumed in Ethiopia, but is not consumed by Ethiopian Jews because it is not kosher (kosher milk must come from kosher animals).\n\n## Shabbat dishes\nShabbat is known as Sanbat in the Amharic and Tigrinya languages. \nSanbat Wat (Sabbath Wat) is a traditional Ethiopian-Jewish wat that is prepared for Shabbat. Sanbat Wat is a doro wat of chicken and hard-boiled eggs served with injera. Sanbat Wat is a spicy dish and is commonly seasoned with berbere, cloves, onions, tomato sauce, and other savory ingredients. Wats made from chicken, meat, and fish are most commonly eaten for Shabbat dinner while vegetarian wats are eaten for breakfast.\n\nDabos, small round rolls, are traditionally served during Shabbat meals. Because Ethiopian Jews usually lacked wine for kiddush, tallah (a beer fermented from gesho leaves) was often used as a substitute. Due to the availability of wine in Israel, Ethiopian-Israelis generally use wine for kiddush.\nBecause Ethiopian Jews traditionally interpret halakhic prohibitions against cooking on Shabbat literally, no heating of food is done on Shabbat. All foods are prepared on Erev Shabbat (Friday) and served room temperature. \nEthiopian Jews who are Shomer Shabbat cannot perform buna, the traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony, during Shabbat. Buna requires lighting a fire and thus the ceremony must be performed before or after Shabbat.\n\n## Holiday foods\n\n\n### Passover\nEthiopian matzah is baked as a circular flatbread 2 feet in diameter, with a soft texture like pita.\nWhile most Jews stopped the practice of the Passover sacrifice after the destruction of the Second Temple, some Ethiopian Jews still continue the practice.\n\n### Rosh Hashanah\nRosh Hashanah is known as Brenha Serkan in Amharic, meaning \"the rising of the dawn.\" Ethiopian Jews traditionally only observed Rosh Hashanah for one day, as opposed to the two days usually observed by Jews elsewhere in the diaspora and in Israel. \nLamb, the most expensive meat available in Ethiopia, was served for the holiday. It was customary for affluent members of the community to hold a community feast for the holiday and invite other members of the community to join.\n\n### Sigd\nEthiopian Jews fast for the holiday of Sigd. To break the fast, it is traditional to eat a lamb or chicken stew served with eggs and potatoes.\nSince meat can be scarce in Ethiopia, Ethiopian Jews usually only eat meat-based stews once a week for Shabbat, and for holidays.\n\n## Ethiopian-Jewish restaurants\nThere are few kosher Ethiopian-Jewish restaurants worldwide, even in Israel. However, more kosher Ethiopian restaurants have opened in Israel over time. Several kosher Ethiopian restaurants have opened in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. A kosher vegan Ethiopian restaurant exists in Tel Aviv.\nIn Harlem, the Tsion Cafe, formerly non-kosher, serves kosher Ethiopian-Jewish/Ethiopian-Israeli inspired cuisine. A kosher vegan Ethiopian restaurant was opened in Brooklyn in March 2020, certified with the \"Mason Jar K\" hechsher under the superversion of Rabbi Sam Reinstein of Congregation Kol Israel.\nAs of 2019, there are no kosher restaurants in Addis Ababa. However, the Chabad house in Addis Ababa offers kosher food.\n\n## See also\nCuisine of the Mizrahi Jews\nCuisine of the Sephardic Jews\nEthiopian cuisine\nIsraeli cuisine\nJewish cuisine\nJewish dietary laws\nKosher foods\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\nOfficial website for Ras Plant Based Ethiopian, a kosher vegan Ethiopian restaurant in New York City.",

    "text": "# Eurasian cuisine of Singapore and Malaysia\n\nThe Eurasian cuisine of Malaysia and Singapore is a type of fusion cuisine.\n\n## Origins\nIn general, Eurasians are people of any mixed European and Asian ancestry. However, if referring to Eurasian cuisine, usually the amalgamation of Portuguese, Dutch, British, Chinese, Malay, and also Indian and Peranakan influences is meant. Within this cuisine, ingredients in European dishes are replaced or complemented by Asian ingredients. Conversely, European ingredients are used in Asian dishes. The cuisine dates to the 16th century.\nFor example, cream in European recipes is replaced by coconut cream and dried Chinese sausage (lap cheong) is used instead of chorizo. Also, the use of soy sauce, chilli and ginger is used interchangeably with vinegar, mustard and Worcestershire sauce.\n\n## Definition\nThe word Eurasian is a portmanteau of European and Asian. There is no clear definition of what can be specified as Eurasian cuisine. It often includes ingredients from Dutch, British, Portuguese, Indian, Chinese cuisines as well as Malay. Some dishes are also found in other cuisines. By local adaptation(s), or by its ubiquitous presence within the Eurasian community, a dish is sometimes considered \"Eurasian\".\n\n## Dishes\nBaca assam, beef cheeks cooked in tamarind water.\nChap chye, a stir-fried vegetable dish consisting of lily buds, wood fungus, shiitake mushrooms, glass vermicelli/cellophane noodles, bean curd sheets, cabbage, carrots and turnips, dried shrimp/prawn, and onions.\nDevil's curry or curry debal (Portuguese), chicken and potatoes in a sauce of chilli, galangal, lemongrass, ginger, turmeric powder, mustard seeds, shallots or onions, garlic, vinegar and kemiri nuts (candle nuts).\nFeng (curry)\nOxtail stew (British), a stew with cinnamon, soy sauce and star anise.\nPang susi, a meat filled oven baked pastry.\nPutugal, a steamed rice cake.\nKueh kochi pulot hitam, a cake of black and white glutinous rice flour with a filling of mung beans or coconut.\nSemur, a type of meat stew (mainly beef), that is braised in thick brown gravy.\nSeybak, a salad made with pork offal.\nShepherd's pie (British), a traditional dish with meat and mashed potatoes with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, Chinese mushrooms and garlic.\nSugee cake, a semolina cake.\n\n## Formal dinners\nA formal Eurasian dinner will include a half dozen or more dishes. Typically the main meal is presented together and served with rice.\n\n## Related cuisines\nIndo cuisine\nKristang cuisine\nPeranakan cuisine\nMacanese cuisine, a fusion of Portuguese and Chinese cuisines\n\n## See also\nEurasian Singaporeans\nList of European cuisines\nList of Asian cuisines\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nGomes, Mary (2009), The Eurasian Cookbook, Horizon Books, Singapore, ISBN 981-04-4344-7\nHutton, Wendy (2003), Eurasian Favourites, Periplus Mini Cookbooks, Periplus, Singapore, ISBN 978-0-7946-0136-2\nPereira, Quentin (2012), Eurasian Heritage Cooking, Marshall Cavendish Cuisine, Singapore, ISBN 978-981-4346-46-7\nD'Silva, Damian (2012), Rebel with a Course, Ate, Singapore, ISBN 978 981 0703424",

Yet, to my knowledge few serious studies have been published on the nature and extent of feudal power in Pakistan, and none to my knowledge on the hegemony which feudal culture enjoys in this country.” Nicolas Martin's work is in this respect an exception, although he argues that it is politically influential landlords, and not all landlords, who wield the despotic and arbitrary powers that are often attributed to the landed classes as a whole.\nDespite its political influence, feudalism has become so unpopular in public expression and the media that \"feudal lords\" are denounced even by some from \"feudal\" families (such as Shehbaz Sharif).\nIn media portrayals, the very popular 1975 Pakistan Television (PTV) series Waris centered around a feudal lord (Chaudhry Hashmat) who rules his fiefdom, \"with an iron grip\".\n\n## History\n\n\n### In Mughal Empire\n\"It was Akbar not the British colonizers who left us this parasitical curse\".\nWhen the British first set foot on the Undivided India, the Mughals were in rule over most part of the region. As a part of their revenue administration was the mansabdari & jagirdari systems through which they regulated control over the land revenue of the country. This system, based on the previous local systems of feudalism dating way beyond the Islamic conquest & adapted by the local Islamic polities like the Delhi Sultanate, was introduced by Mughal Emperor Akbar largely based upon the land reforms of Sher Shah, and remained in place from the late 16th century till the fall of the Mughal Empire. A Brief History of British Land Acquisition in India\nThis acquisition of lands – and its pattern – determined the method of revenue collection that the colonial power opted for, beginning with the diwani, the first time the British gained the right to collect revenue from local land. In due time, with the introduction of the British Raj, they would stamp their legal authority over the Undivided India by introducing a number of reforms that would systematically create a new breed of intermediaries in the revenue system.\n\n### Under colonial rule\n\n\n### In independent Pakistan\nAlmost half of Pakistan's GDP and the bulk of its export earnings are derived from the agricultural sector, which is controlled by a few elite feudal families. Some of the most powerful feudal dynasties include the Jatoi, Zardari, Mazari, Mamdot, Noon, Tiwana, Bhutto, Mirani, Daultana, Ranjha, Zehri, Khar, Gillani, Qureshi, Makhdoom, Mulqani, Mehr, Khan, Laleka families each own thousands of acres of prime agricultural land with thousands of villagers living on and tending to the family land. The Jatoi, Mamdot and Daultana, family owns 45,000 acres of land and the Khan and Tiwana, families own 30,000 acres. Ranjha family of Kot Sher Muhammad, Khar family of Khar Gharbi, Noon family of Nurpur, Makhdoom and Mulqani families are smaller each owning between 6,000 and 12,000 acres of agricultural land. 14th Heredity Chief of Swati Tribe, Khan Habibullah Khan Swati II of Garhi Habibullah Khan owns 31,000 acres of land in Mansehra District and Battagram District making him the biggest landlord of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while 16th Nawab of Allai, Prince Nawaz Khan Swati owns 29,000 acres of land in Allai District making him 2nd biggest landlord in KPK. With this concentration of economic power, they also have considerable political power. During the land reforms in Pakistan, several large land-owning families in the Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) were affected. Notably, the Swati Jagirdar family, among others in the region, faced redistribution of their lands as part of these reforms. The reforms aimed to alleviate land concentration and promote agricultural equity, impacting many prominent families in Hazara.\nThe leadership of the All India Muslim League was heavily dependent on the support of the various Muslim landed elites like Taluqdars, Zamindars, Chaudharys, Rajas, Rais, Malik, Tumandar, Jagirdars, Nawab, Zaildar, Sardars & Khans for support, which was clearly demonstrated in the 1937 elections. By the time of 1946 elections, the Muslim League was able to decisively obtain the support of the Muslim peasantry through mass mobilisation in the name of Islam through the Pakistan movement. Its successor, the Pakistan Muslim League, continued to be dominated by big landlords. Examples are\n\nLiaquat Ali Khan  - the 1st prime minister of Pakistan, was born to the Nawab family of Kunjpura in Karnal.\nKhawaja Nazimuddin - the 2nd prime minister of Pakistan, who later succeeded Jinnah as governor-general, was a scion of the Nawab family of Dhaka.\nIskander Ali Mirza - the last governor general, who subsequently became Pakistan's first president, was a descendant of the Nawab family of Murshidabad.\nMuhammad Ali Bogra - the 3rd prime minister of Pakistan, was a member of the Nawab family of Dhanbari in Dhaka.\nHuseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy - the 4th prime minister of Pakistan, was a descendant of the Suhrawardy family which held the taluqdari of Chitwa in West Midnapore.\nFeroz Khan Noon - the 5th prime minister of Pakistan, came from the aristocratic Muslim Rajput family that had extensive land holdings in Sargodha.\nIftikhar Hussain Khan Mamdot & Mumtaz Daultana - two leaders who served as chief ministers in Pakistan's most populous province of Punjab, had extensive land holdings. Hussain was the titular Nawab of Mamdot in Firozpur while Daultana was a rich landholder from Luddan.\nThe sole exception were the Jinnahs.\nDuring the '50s and the '60s, the feudal families retained control over national affairs through the bureaucracy, industry and military. The increasing wealth inequality between the landed gentry and the peasantry under the dictatorship of Ayub Khan led to mass uprisings, led by socialist outfits like the Pakistan People's Party and the Awami League. In 1971, PPP leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, son of the diwan to the Nawab of Junagadh, assumed power as the prime minister and retained it until he was overthrown and executed by the military in 1977. Despite being a landowner himself, Bhutto passed land reform laws, restricting the amount of lands that could be held by a person and implementing redistribution of excess land to the tenant farmers. Bhutto's land reforms were widely denounced by Islamist outfits like the Jamaat-e-Islami and its leader Syed Abul Ala Maududi, who decried land reforms as being tantamount to communism. Under the Islamisation of Pakistan ushered in by Bhutto's successor, the military dictator Zia-ul-Haq, many dispossessed landowners were allowed to take back the lands that had been confiscated from them by the Bhutto administration. The Federal Shariat Court, created by Zia to enforce sharia, denounced land reform as bid'ah. Finally in 1989, a 5-member Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court, in a 3-to-2 decision, nullified all of Bhutto's land reforms in the landmark Qazalbash Waqf v Chief Land Commissioner case, bringing back land ownership to 1947 levels. 2 out of the 3 judges who branded the concept of land reforms as un-Islamic, were muftis practicing in the Federal Shariat Court, appointed by Zia. Bhutto's daughter Benazir Bhutto, who was the prime minister at that time, couldn't do anything in this matter, as the Constitution of Pakistan had been amended by Zia to make it illegal for the government to implement any 'un-Islamic' law. Hence landed aristocrats continue to dominate Pakistani politics owing to the Islamist opposition to land redistribution.\nFor example, a former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Yousuf Raza Gilani, is a major landowner from South Punjab (Multan) and from a long-standing political family. The former President Asif Ali Zardari is a large landowner from Sindh  as well as the widower of Benazir Bhutto. Arif Nakai (former Chief Minister of Punjab) and Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri (Former Federal Minister) families have held power from decades in Kasur. Hamid Nasir Chattha's (former Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan) family has held power for decades in Gujranwala-Hafizabad districts as the Chief of the Chattha tribe. Khalid Mahmood Ranjha (MPA Provincial Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Parliamentary Affairs) and Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha (MNA former Federal Minister of State) family has held power for decades in Mandi Bahauddin District and Sargodha District as the Chief Ranjha family of Kot Sher Muhammad feudals. Hina Rabbani Khar (MNA former Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs) and Ghulam Mustafa Khar (MPA former Governor of Punjab) family has held power for decades in Muzaffargarh District as the Chief Khar family of Khar Gharbi feudal. Shah Mehmood Qureshi (MNA former Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs) hails from a prominent feudal Sufi family in Multan and is also followed as a religious saint.\nThus, large landowners have dominated Pakistan's politics since the country's inception.\n\n### Feudal Families Province wise\n\n\n## See also\nThe State of Bonded Labor in Pakistan\nIndian feudalism\nPolitics of Pakistan\nAgriculture in Pakistan § Land distribution and land reform\nIslamic economics in Pakistan § Land reform and Islamisation\nMurder of Nazim Jokhio\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nAnsari, Sarah. 1992.

Another common lovo item is palusami; consisting of young, tender taro leaves, coconut milk, ginger, garlic, chilli, lime juice, salt and possibly including  corned beef, mutton or fish, palusami is also a common menu item along with rourou, a similar taro leaf dish. Yams, cassava and taro are the main starches in a lovo, and it takes many people to prepare, hence its  significance.\n\n## History\n\n\n## Snacks\nDesserts or snacks are common and are eaten in between meals—often for morning tea and afternoon teas. Some common ones include pies filled with custard or pumpkin or pineapple. Steamed puddings are also common but these are rich in sugars and fats. Most homes would use coconut cream, caramelized sugar to give the colour, flour, baking powder as the main ingredients. The pudding mixture is poured into tins and steamed for 1–2 hours. To improve the flavour, sometimes cinnamon or raisins are added. Some nice desserts are also made with cassava. Cassava is first grated and then sugar is added. It is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. Burnt sugar pudding (purini or pudini) is one of the most popular puddings in the Fijian cuisine. Vakalolo is a traditional dessert made with cassava, coconut, ginger root, sugar, cloves, then steamed in a banana leaf.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n\n### Staples\nTaro is the most important staple for special occasions. It is available in 70 different varieties; some turn pink or yellow or remain white after cooking. It can be grown in any soil conditions. Taro is a rich source of fiber.\nCassava or tavioka has replaced yams and is now the most cultivated and consumed staple crop in Fiji.  It is boiled in salt and water until soft and eaten with stews and curries.\nKumala (sweet potato) was not traditionally a staple in the native Fijian diet. It was brought from Papua New Guinea. It is easy to grow and provides a good yield. Now it is the cheapest of all root crops and is eaten by most people in soups, stews or curries.\nBreadfruit is a seasonal staple. It is grown in most households in the villages.\nRice was brought by the Indian immigrants and was grown for domestic use around Fiji.\n\n### Vegetables\nTaro leaf, rourou, is the most important cash crop for Fijian communities. It is used in everyday meals and also used for ceremonial meals to make palusami.\nBele (Abelmoschus manihot, also hibiscus bele/hibiscus spinach [hibiscus manihot]) is one of the most nutritious traditional vegetables in Oceania. It is a highly nutritious green leafy vegetable grown in almost every household. The leaves are rich sources of vitamins and minerals such as iron and magnesium, pro Vit A and C, also have very high levels of folate, an important nutrient for pregnant and nursing women.\nAmaranthus, tubua, is another vegetable commonly eaten in most homes. Other leaves which are eaten include pumpkin, cassava and sweet potato leaves.\n\n### Coconut\nCoconut is especially liked by Fijians. It is grown in most coastal areas. Coconut is not only used for food but plays an important role in Fiji's economy.\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Main\nFish suruwa – a Fijian-style fish curry.\nKokoda – Raw fish marinated in freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice with coconut milk added after it is \"cooked\" together with finely diced tomatoes, chillies and salt.\nLovo – A traditional Fijian method of cooking. Food such as meat, fish and vegetables are wrapped in leaves and placed on hot rocks, buried and cooked for several hours.\nPalusami – Parcels made with taro leaves, filled with thick coconut cream, onions, salt and canned meat.\nRourou – Taro leaf stew.\n\n## Drinks\n\n\n### Kava/Yaqona\nKava is a drink made from powdered roots of yaqona plants. The powder is placed in a muslin cloth and small amounts of water are added to extract the juice out of the powder. Kava is not unique to the Fijian culture; it is widely consumed in other Pacific nations.  It has religious and tribal significance and is used as a peace offering known as sevusevu during Fijian functions. Kava consumption can be habit-forming. However, there is no evidence of kava causing physical addiction nor of long-term risks due to its regular use. \nKava is used to calm anxiety, stress, and restlessness, and treat sleep problems. It is also used as a remedy to certain neurological and mental disorders, common colds and other respiratory tract infections, tuberculosis, muscle pain, and as cancer prevention. Some use the drink for urinary tract infections, pain and swelling of the uterus, venereal disease, menstrual discomfort, and as an aphrodisiac. Kava is applied to the skin for skin diseases including leprosy, to promote wound healing, and as a painkiller. It is also used as a mouthwash for canker sores and toothaches.\n\n## Changes in eating patterns over time\nWith changes in eating patterns, there has been a shift towards consumption of more energy-dense foods and decreased intake of fruit and vegetables. The processed foods are more readily available in shops and canteens and are cheaper. They contain high amounts of sugar and sodium which contribute to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, traditional foods are still valued and used for special occasions. Nutrition research involving children show 90% of children consume sugar-sweetened beverages on a daily basis and 74% consume less fruit and vegetables.\n\n## Fast food\nBoth local and foreign fast food chains have started to enter the Fijian market since the late 1990s. There are McDonald's (locally called Maccas) and Burger King, while Kentucky Fried Chicken and Super Eagle Boys Pizza formerly operated in Fiji.\n\n## See also\n\nOceanic cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Depending on their use and texture, it can be crispy, crunchy, chewy, or soft. Much like oatmeal, the term \"flattened rice\" and its equivalents in other languages may refer to the ingredient itself or a dish based on the ingredient.\n\n## South Asia\nFlattened rice is a breakfast staple in South Asia, where it is called chiura, poha, avalakki (Kannada), aval (Tamil, Malayalam), atukulu (Telugu), chuda (Odia), chira (Bengali), sira (Assamese), and other names depending on the local language. It is particularly popular in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Poha is made by dehusking rice grains and then parboiling or soaking them in hot water for 45 minutes. They are then dried, roasted, and flattened with rollers. They usually come in thin, medium, and thick varieties. Thinner varieties are ideal for cooking and dessert use, while thicker varieties are ideal for deep-frying. Poha can be eaten as snacks such as Indori poha, or cooked into various sweet, savory, or spicy dishes. Enthusiasts of the dish, especially in India, celebrate 7 June as International Poha Day.\n\n### Nepal\nFlattened rice is called chiura (चिउरा) in Nepali and baji in Newar. It is part of the traditional samay baji platter, and holds an important place in the traditional Newar wedding ceremony. Chiura is usually included in the bride price. After the initial wedding ceremony, the families escort the bride back to the groom's house. During this procession, the pounded rice ceremony occurs. The bride and groom are seated next to one another, and the bride is given the chiura. The groom asks three times for the bride to give him the chiura, each time using a less formal version of the pronoun \"you\".\n\n## Southeast Asia\n\n\n### Cambodia\nFlattened rice is known in Cambodia as ambok (Khmer: អំបុក). It is made by toasting newly harvested rice (with husks on) on a wok, then pounding the heated rice with a large wooden mortar and pestle until flat. The husks are then removed. Ambok plays a very significant role in the Cambodian Water Festival (Bon Om Touk). They are commonly eaten mixed with bananas, palm sugar, and coconut water, or roasted together with small shrimp.\n\n### Myanmar\nFlattened rice in Myanmar is known as mont hsan (Burmese: မုန့်ဆန်း). In Lower Myanmar, it is traditionally given as an offering to U Shin Gyi, a guardian nat (spirit) of waterways. Mont hsan is also consumed in Upper Myanmar, and is used as an ingredient in Burmese snacks called mont.\n\n### Philippines\nFlattened rice in the Philippines is called pinipig. It is made using immature glutinous rice that is pounded and toasted. Pinipig is commonly eaten plain, used as toppings in desserts and drinks, or made into cakes.\nA notable variant of pinipig, from Pampanga, is duman, which differs in that it is toasted first before being pounded. It is celebrated annually in the Duman Festival of Santa Rita, Pampanga.\n\n### Thailand\nFlattened rice is known as khao mao (Thai: ข้าวเม่า) in Thailand. Similar to the Philippine variant, it uses immature green glutinous rice. It is made by soaking dehusked rice grains in water for several hours, steaming them in a bamboo container, toasting them in a wok, and then pounding them flat in a mortar with a pestle.\n\n### Vietnam\nFlattened rice in Vietnam is known as cốm. It is made by toasting immature green rice grains over low heat and then pounding them flat in a mortar with a pestle. The husk is removed afterwards via winnowing. It can be eaten plain, used as an ingredient in other dishes, or made into cakes known as bánh cốm. It is commonly eaten during autumn.\n\n## See also\n\nList of rice dishes\nPuffed rice\nRice Krispies\nRolled oats\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Food industry in Bangladesh\n\nThe food industry is a rapidly growing sector in Bangladesh, employing a significant portion of the labor force in the country.\n\n## History\nBetween 2004 and 2010, the food processing industry in Bangladesh grew at an average 7.7 percent per annum. Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, in its 25006 Economic Census, reported that there were approximately 246 medium-sized food processing industries employing 19 percent of the industrial manufacturing workforce in Bangladesh or 8 percent of the total manufacturing labor force. The food industry employs 2.45 percent of the country's total labor force and its share in the GDP was 2.01 percent in 2010. There are also numerous small scale factories and domestic units engaged in food processing throughout the country. According to some industry analysts, the food processing sector in Bangladesh is a 4.5 billion US Dollar industry. In 2010, Bangladesh exported over $700 million worth of processed food and beverages, over 60 percent of them were shrimp and fish products.\nFood processing in Bangladesh has traditionally been small scale, with domestic or family business using common processing knowledge for the conservation and handling of raw agricultural commodities to make them usable as food and feed. Although commercial scale food processing using modern technology especially for wheat and rice milling, mustard seed crushing and very limited bread and cookie manufacturing appeared during the 1960s, the growth of this sector did not gain momentum in terms of operational scale and quality until the 1980s. Recently the defining characteristics of the industry has been the processing of increasingly diverse products to meet the changing demands of the Bangladesh population. The major food processing sub-sectors in Bangladesh include dairy, edible oil, sugar, rice, wheat, fruit and vegetable, tea, poultry/beef, pulses and spices and fish processing industries. Induced by the vigorous growth of the diverse middle class population of Bangladesh and the growing demands for additional consumption, the food processing sector is set to witness further hefty expansion in the coming years.\n\n\n== References ==",

In Bhutanese cities it is common to find fried rice street vendors stationing their food carts in busy streets or residential areas. Many Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes.\n\n## Preparation\nCooked rice is the primary ingredient, with a wide variety of additional ingredients, such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb, mutton), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), and mushrooms. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, ginger and garlic are often added for extra flavor. Cooking oils such as vegetable oil, sesame oil, clarified butter, or lard can be used to grease the wok or frying pan to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of soy sauce, oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce and many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped scallions, sliced chili, fried shallots, sprigs of parsley or coriander leaves, mint leaves, sliced boiled eggs, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed flakes (gim or nori), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables.\nMaking fried rice with fresh rice can prevent it from frying properly, leading to an undesirably soft texture.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Origins in China\nThe earliest record of fried rice is in the Sui dynasty (589–618 AD) in China, particularly in the city of Yangzhou. It was developed as a practical solution for using leftover rice, which would otherwise harden after cooling. By stir-frying day-old rice with oil, eggs, vegetables and small amounts of meat, households were able to create a new dish that was both flavourful and economical.\n\nThe technique of stir-frying, known in Chinese as chǎo, was already a central feature of Chinese cooking. By the early medieval period, stir-frying had become one of the most versatile methods of preparing quick meals, allowing ingredients to be cooked evenly and seasoned efficiently in a hot wok. Fried rice thus fit seamlessly into the established culinary repertoire, eventually becoming a common staple in many Chinese regional cuisines.\nOver time, different variations of fried rice developed within China, particularly in southern regions such as Fujian and Guangdong, where rice was the dominant staple. These southern styles would later influence the kinds of fried rice that spread abroad through migration and trade, laying the foundation for adaptations in Southeast Asia.\n\n### Localisation\nAs fried rice spread across South-East Asia, it was gradually localised into distinctive regional styles. Within the Malay Archipelago, it evolved into nasi goreng, which diverged from its Chinese antecedent through the use of local flavourings. Seasonings such as kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), sambal, terasi or belacan (shrimp paste), shallots and garlic gave the dish a darker colour, more pronounced aroma and a balance of sweet, savoury and spicy flavours. Variants developed in present-day Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and southern Thailand, each incorporating regional ingredients and tastes while sharing a common identity under the name nasi goreng.\nElsewhere in South-East Asia, parallel adaptations developed. In Thailand, fried rice became khao phat, seasoned with fish sauce and served with accompaniments such as lime and cucumber. In the Philippines, it appeared as sinangag, a garlic-based fried rice commonly eaten at breakfast alongside eggs and cured meats. In Vietnam, cơm chiên often featured Chinese sausage and local herbs. While each variation reflected local tastes, in Indonesia and Malaysia nasi goreng became the most widespread and distinctive form, cutting across ethnic and social boundaries.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n### East Asia\n\n\n### Southeast Asia\n\n\n### South Asia\n\n\n### Pacific\n\n\n### Americas\nArroz frito is a denomination used in the Spanish speaking world, meaning \"fried rice\", with adjectives describing the Chinese-inspired varieties, e.g. arroz chino, arroz cantonés, or local specialties arroz chaufa/chaulafán/chaufán/chofán, arroz frito tres delicias.\n\nBacon and egg fried rice\n\n### Africa\n\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Fusion cuisine\n\nFusion cuisine is a cuisine that combines elements of different culinary traditions that originate from different countries, regions, or cultures. Cuisines of this type are not categorized according to any one particular cuisine style and have played a part in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.\nThe term fusion cuisine, added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002, is defined as \"a style of cookery which blends ingredients and methods of preparation from different countries, regions, or ethnic groups; food cooked in this style.\"\n\n## Categories\nFusion food is created by combining various cooking techniques from different cultures to produce a new type of cuisine. Although it is commonly invented by chefs, fusion cuisine can occur naturally. Cuisines which get fused can either come from a particular region (such as East Asian cuisine and European cuisine), sub-region (such as Southwestern American cuisine and New Mexican cuisine) or a country (such as Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine, Korean cuisine, French cuisine, Italian cuisine).\nAsian fusion restaurants which combine the various cuisines of different Asian countries have become popular in many parts of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Often featured are East Asian, Southeast Asian, and South Asian dishes alongside one another and offering dishes that are inspired combinations of such cuisines. California cuisine is considered a fusion culture, taking inspiration particularly from Italy, France, Mexico, the idea of the European delicatessen, and East Asia, and then creating traditional dishes from these cultures with non-traditional ingredients – such as California pizza. In Australia, due to immigration, fusion cuisine is being reinvented and is becoming increasingly the norm at numerous cafes and restaurants, with Asian-fusion restaurants like Tetsuya's in Sydney ranking highly in The World's 50 Best Restaurants.\nIn the United Kingdom, fish and chips can be seen as an early fusion dish due to its marrying of ingredients stemming from Jewish, French, and Belgian cuisines.\nFilipino cuisine is sometimes characterized as the \"original Asian fusion cuisine\", combining native culinary traditions and ingredients with the very different cuisines of China, Spain, Malaysia, Thailand and Mongolia, among others, due to its unique colonial history. Food in Malaysia (also Indonesia) is another example of fusion cuisine which blends Malay, Javanese, Chinese, and Indian and light influences from Thai, Portuguese, Dutch, and British cuisines. Oceanic cuisine combines the different cuisines of the various island nations.\n\n## Types\nAnother form of fusion food can be created by utilizing ingredients and flavors from one culture to create a unique twist on a dish from the different cultures. For example, a taco pizza is a type of pizza created using taco ingredients such as cheddar and pepper jack cheese, salsa, refried beans, and other common taco ingredients, fusing both Italian and Mexican cuisines.\nSimilar approaches have been used for fusion sushi, such as rolling maki with different types of rice and ingredients such as curry and basmati rice, cheese and salsa with Spanish rice, or spiced ground lamb and capers rolled with Greek-style rice and grape leaves, which resembles inside-out dolmades. Some fusion cuisines have themselves become accepted as a national cuisine, as with Peruvian Nikkei cuisine, which combines Japanese spices and seasonings and Peruvian ingredients like ají with seafood. A quintessential Peruvian Nikkei dish is \"maki acevichado\" or \"ceviche roll\", consisting of ceviche with avocado rolled into maki.\nSaudi Arabia has been investing in resources to preserve their culture. In Jeddah, different cultures from Africa and Asia have used the combination of Saudi Arabia's spices to create new fusion foods found throughout the region and the country.\n\n## History\nFusion cuisine has existed for millennia as a form of cross-cultural exchange, though the term was only defined in the late 1900s. Mixtures of different cultures' cuisines have been adapted since the 16th century.\n\n### Colonialism\nA lasting legacy of colonialism is fusion food. Colonial trade resulted in the exchange of ingredients, such as bánh mì originating from French ingredients used in French Indochina, Jamaican patties combining the turnover with spices and peppers from the British Empire's possessions in Asia and Africa, and ramen originating as shina soba or \"Chinese noodle\" from the Empire of Japan's occupation of China's island territories in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Indigenous domestic servants were active participants in creating fusion foods by mixing ingredients and techniques.\nAlongside the creation of new dishes, colonialism also introduced class dimensions of food as cultural capital that modified consumption patterns. Indigenous practices of eating guinea pigs in Peru were banned and considered savage until recent movements to reclaim food practices, resulting in the erasure of much traditional knowledge in indigenous communities. These hierarchies are argued to be present in modern fusion food, which has been criticised for being portrayed as European cuisines 'elevating' other cuisines into modernity. Colonial debates also extend into discourse about the authenticity of foods such as orientalist critiques of immigrant food being gentrified as ‘ethnic’ food.\n\n### Adaptation to local palates\nIn a climate of increasing globalization, where cultures and cuisines frequently cross-borders, cooking and food evolves to cater to the palates of the local communities, a phenomenon known as \"glocalization\", a portmanteau of \"localization\" and \"globalization\".” Fusion cuisine is sometimes created by multinational restaurants, especially fast food chains. A primary example of this corporate globalized expansion is in the case of McDonald's regional menus which are adapted to \"reflect different tastes and local traditions for every country in which we have restaurants\". In addition to catering to the regional food traditions, McDonald's also takes an additional consideration for religious beliefs and laws, as seen in the absence of beef and pork items on Indian menus.\nBeyond accounting for the cultural or religious differences in cuisine, some fusion foods have also been created to fit the taste preferences of local communities when ethnic or cultural foods from abroad were introduced. A hallmark example of this adaptation is in the popular sushi roll, the California roll, which was created in America in the latter half of the 20th century. A popular myth behind its composition containing crab, vegetables, and rice on the exterior cites the American aversion to foreign ingredients such as raw fish and seaweed.\nThese adjustments to foreign cuisines have both corporate and historical origins. In the example of McDonald's, the creation of regional menus can be seen as an economic choice to cater to the local palates and traditions. Another example of popularized fusion foods is the Korean stew budae-jjigae, which was created by combining American ingredients of Spam, Vienna sausages, and sliced cheese, in a kimchi stew in the wake of the Korean War during which American tastes and influence were prevalent in Korea.\n\n### Role of immigration\nImmigrants play a significant role in shaping modern fusion cuisine.  Food can often be a form of cultural expression that fosters a relationship with one's heritage, and fusion can emerge from creating foods from immigrant's adaptation of their own cultural food to the ingredients available in the host country or region. Immigrants may adapt the use of their cultural ingredients to local culinary traditions. For example, Vietnamese immigrants in the Southern United States used Vietnamese condiments in traditionally Creole cuisine, while adhering to Southern cooking methods. Similarly, the establishment of American Chinese cuisine has origins in Chinese-owned small businesses in American ghettos and Chinatowns, with many of these restaurants responsible for the adaptation of Chinese cuisine to American palettes.\nImmigrants may also adapt their cultural flavors to the availability of ingredients in the host country: Indian-Chinese cuisine shaped by Chinese immigrants to British-ruled India often uses Indian spice and flavor profiles such as garam masala and turmeric. As such, immigrant-founded fusion cuisines also play a role in shaping food culture in the host country by introducing new flavors and ingredients.\nIndian-Chinese cuisine is an example of how gradual migration and exchange across shared international borders contributes to fusion cuisine. Similar cases are Sino-Korean food emerging from Chinese diasporas in Korea and shared borders between Korea and Northeastern China, and Mexican-American cuisine influenced by Mexican immigration to the Southwest United States that combines Mexican, Native American, and European flavors.  \nThe convergence of two or more immigrant groups in a different host country can also lead to the emergence of fusion cuisines. Chinese and Latin American immigrants to the United States have collaboratively founded fusion restaurants, serving dishes such as Chinese dumplings filled with traditional slow-roasted pork from the Yucatàn Peninsula. In the United States, Asian fusion cuisine can constitute pan-Asian multi-ethnic ingredients such as rice, leading to a newfound form of \"American\" Asian food unfound in Asia. One popular example of pan-Asian fusion food found in North America is the rice bowl, often with ingredients commonly used together in Asia such as garlic with chili, stir-fried vegetables with tofu. This illustrates the dynamic process between fusion food and its relationship with intercultural solidarity, influenced by both local and other immigrant cultures.\n\n### Modern fusion food\nJapanese cooking techniques were combined with French techniques in 1970s France to create nouvelle cuisine.\nWolfgang Puck is attributed as one of the pioneers of fusion cuisine, with some dispute. However, his restaurant Chinois on Main was named after the term attributed to Richard Wing, who in the 1960s combined French and Chinese cooking at the former Imperial Dynasty restaurant in Hanford, California.\nChef Norman Van Aken was the first person to use the term \"fusion cooking\" as he delivered a speech at a symposium in Santa Fe in 1988. Soon journalist Regina Schrambling wrote about Van Aken's work and the term spread around the globe. Norman Van Aken ended his speech by discussing the history of fusion cuisine, such as the use of coffee in Italian cuisine. Van Aken related this to coffee being used in different desserts such as Calabrian ricotta with chocolate mousse.\n\n## List of fusion cuisines\nAmerican cuisine (European cuisine, Indigenous cuisine of the Americas, Soul food, Cajun cuisine, Louisiana Creole cuisine, Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine, Mormon foodways, Texan cuisine, Tex-Mex cuisine, and New-Mexican cuisine)\nBetawi cuisine (Indonesian cuisine with roots from Arab, Chinese, European, and Indian cuisines)\nChifa (Chinese Cantonese cuisine and Peruvian cuisine)\nHong Kong cuisine (Chinese cuisine, predominantly Cantonese, European cuisine, especially British, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian cuisines)\nIndian Chinese cuisine (Indian cuisine and Chinese cuisine)\nItalian-American cuisine (Italian cuisine and American cuisine)\nItameshi (Japanese cuisine and Italian cuisine)\nJapanese Chinese cuisine (Japanese cuisine and Chinese cuisine)\nLouisiana Creole cuisine (American cuisine with roots from West African, French, Spanish, and Native American cuisines)\nMacanese cuisine (Chinese cuisine, with roots predominantly from Cantonese cuisine, Portuguese cuisine, and Southeast Asian cuisines)\nMalaysian Chinese cuisine (Chinese cuisine with roots from Fujian, Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew cuisines, and Malaysian cuisine)\nMinnesotan cuisine (Swedish and Norwegian cuisine, with elements from American and Eastern European cuisines)\nNew Mexican cuisine (Native American cuisine with roots from Spanish and Mexican cuisines)\nPeruvian cuisine (European cuisine, particularly Spanish and Italian, Asian cuisine, particularly Cantonese and Japanese, African cuisine, particularly Maghrebi and West African, and Indigenous cuisine, particularly Quechua and Aymara)\nSingaporean cuisine (Chinese cuisine, Malay/Indonesian cuisine, Indian cuisine, Peranakan cuisine, Eurasian cuisine, and European cuisine, particularly English and Portuguese cuisines)\nTaiwanese cuisine (Chinese cuisine, particularly Fujian and Hakka, Japanese cuisine, and American cuisine)\nTex-Mex (American cuisine and Mexican cuisine)\nYōshoku (Japanese cuisine and European cuisine)\n\n## See also\n2010s in food\nAmerican Chinese cuisine\nCalifornia cuisine\nEurasian cuisine of Singapore and Malaysia\nHawaiian cuisine\nKorean-Mexican fusion\nMigrants' food consumption\nModern Australian cuisine\nNew American cuisine\nNouvelle cuisine\nPeranakan cuisine\nSushi burrito\nSushi pizza\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Fusion cuisine at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Garam masala\n\nGaram masala (Hindustani: garam masālā, lit. 'hot or warm spices') is a blend of ground spices originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in Indian, Pakistani, Nepalese, Bangladeshi,  and Caribbean cuisines. It is used alone or with other seasonings. The specific combination differs by region, but it regularly incorporates a blend of flavours like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, cloves, bay leaves, star anise, and peppercorns. Garam masala is used in a wide range of dishes, including marinades, pickles, stews, and curries.\n\n## Ingredients\nThe composition of garam masala differs regionally, with many recipes across the Indian subcontinent according to regional and personal taste, and none is considered more authentic than another. The components of the mix are roasted, then ground together or added to the dish for flavour just before finishing cooking.\nA typical Indian version of garam masala contains (with Hindustani names in parentheses):\n\nFennel (sauṅf)\nIndian bay leaves or malabathrum (tej pattā)\nBlack and white peppercorns (kāli/safed mirch)\nCloves (lauṅg)\nCinnamon or cassia bark (dālacīnī)\nMace (outer covering of nutmeg) (javitri)\nBlack and green cardamom pods (ilāīcī)\nCumin (jīra)\nCoriander seeds (dhaniā)\nRed chili powder (lāl mirch)\nSome recipes call for the spices to be blended with herbs, while others call for the spices to be ground with water, vinegar, or other liquids to make a paste. Some recipes include nuts, onions or garlic, or small quantities of star anise, asafoetida, chili, stone flower (known as dagadphool, lichen), and kababchini (cubeb). The flavours may be blended to achieve a balanced effect, or a single flavour may be emphasised. A masala may be toasted before use to release its flavours and aromas. In the east of the Indian subcontinent, in West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and Bangladesh only cardamom, cinnamon and clove may be substituted for the assortment.\nThe Burmese masala (မဆလာ) spice blend used in Burmese curries typically consists of ground cinnamon or cassia, cardamon, cloves, and black pepper.\n\n## See also\nBaharat\nChaat masala\nCurry powder\nPanch phoron (Indian five-spice blend)\nChinese five-spice blend\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nSpices Name in Hindi and English Archived 1 October 2022 at the Wayback Machine",

    "text": "# Chaas\n\nChaas (gu:છાશ chhash, hi:छाछ chhachh) is a curd-based drink popular across the Indian subcontinent. In Magahi and Bundeli, it is called Mattha. In Rajasthani it is called Khati chaas or khato, in Odia it is called Ghol/Chaash, moru in Tamil and Malayalam, taak in Marathi, majjiga in Telugu, majjige in Kannada, ale (pronounced a-lay) in Tulu and ghol in Bengali. In Indian English, it is often referred to as buttermilk.\n\n## Etymology\nThe name Chaas or Chaach is derived from Sanskrit word Chacchika (छच्छिका), meaning churned yogurt from which butter has been removed.\n\n## Preparation and variations\nChaas is made by churning yogurt (curds/dahi) and cold water together in a pot, using a hand-held instrument called madhani (whipper). This can be consumed plain or seasoned with a variety of spices or made sweet (and then known as Lassi). Chaas can be made from fresh yogurt, and the natural flavour of such chaas is mildly sweet.\n\n## Seasoning and flavours\nChaas can be consumed plain, but a little salt is usually added. This is the most common seasoning for chaas. Numerous other seasonings and spices can be added to salted chaas, either singly or in combination with each other. These spices are usually roasted in a wok, using a spoonful of cooking oil, before being added to the Chaas. The spices which can be added thus are: Coarsely ground and roasted cumin seeds, curry leaves, asafoetida, grated ginger, very finely diced green chillies and Mustard seeds. Sugar can also be added to chaas, but if sugar is added, then neither salt nor spice is usually used.\nVendors have come up with several proprietary products and standardized flavours of chaas which are produced on an industrial scale and sold as bottled drinks. The best-seller among such brands is Amul's Masala Chaas, which has standardized several traditional flavours for the mass bottled-drink market. Other popular modern flavours available as bottled drinks include rose-flavoured Chaas Gulabi and mint-flavoured Mint Chaas.\n\n## Consumption\nIn the rural areas of India, the consumption of chaas has cultural resonances and associations which are not found in the context of other beverages like tea, coffee or lassi. An earthenware pot is used to prepare chaas and store it for a few hours before consumption. Using earthenware to store the chaas helps keep it cool without the need to refrigerate it, even in the height of summer. In the extremely hot desert areas of Gujarat and Rajasthan, people consume chaas with salt after getting exposed to the sun because this may aid rehydration. Chaas or Moru is consumed more in Southern India as it rehydrates the body from the hot climate. Chaas is consumed all year round. It is usually taken immediately after meals, but is also consumed on its own as a beverage.\nPeople also consume chaas for its health benefits. The condiments in chaas, especially pepper and ginger, help reduce the burning sensation felt with acidity. Those spices also help improve digestion. Chaas is also packed with electrolytes and water, helping the body recover from dehydration.\n\n## See also\n\nLassi\nList of fermented foods\nList of Indian beverages\nMattha\nBorhani, a similar Bangladeshi drink\nAyran, a similar Turkish drink\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Global cuisine\n\nThe global cuisine or world cuisine is a cuisine that is practiced around the world. A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking that includes specific practices and traditions, often associated with a specific region, country, or culture. To become a global cuisine, a local, regional, or national cuisine must spread internationally and be commonly served around the world. There have been significant improvements and advances during the 20th century in food preservation, storage, shipping, and production, and today many countries, cities, and regions have access to their traditional cuisines and many other global cuisines.\n\n## Asia\n\n\n### Nepal\n\n\n### Philippines\n\n\n### Japan\nJapanese cuisine has spread throughout the world, and representative dishes such as sushi and ramen are among the most popular.  In many cases, Japanese food is adapted and reinvented to fit the preferences of the local populace. For instance, the California roll is a popular dish in the United States that is a modification of the Japanese makizushi, a type of sushi. In South Korea, both the Japanese curry and the ramen have been imported and popularized primarily in the form of instant food. Tonkatsu and tempura, which are derived from Western food, are now considered and marketed as uniquely Japanese, as well as Japanese curry, which is derived from Indian curry.\nIn many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, and Brazil, Japanese restaurants have become popular. Among these countries, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia are key consumers, according to recent research.\nThe market of Japanese ingredients is also growing, with brands such as Ajinomoto, Kikkoman, Nissin and Kewpie mayonnaise, are establishing production base in other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia.\n\n### China\nChinese cuisine has become widespread throughout many other parts of the world — from Asia to the Americas, Australia, Western Europe and Southern Africa. In recent years, connoisseurs of Chinese cuisine have also sprouted in Eastern Europe and South Asia. American Chinese cuisine and Canadian Chinese food are popular examples of local varieties. Local ingredients would be adopted while maintaining the style and preparation technique.\nTraditional Chinese cuisines include Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang, all of which are defined and termed per the respective regions within China where they developed. These regional cuisines are sometimes referred to as the \"eight culinary traditions of China.\" A number of different styles contribute to Chinese cuisine, but perhaps the best known and most influential are the Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong cuisines. These styles are distinctive from one another due to factors such as available resources, climate, geography, history, cooking techniques and lifestyle. Many Chinese traditional regional cuisines rely on basic methods of food preservation such as drying, salting, pickling and fermentation.\n\n### Thailand\nThai cuisine is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and other parts of Asia. Thai restaurants are becoming more and more common, serving Thai curry and other traditional dishes.\n\n### India\nIndian cuisine has contributed to shaping the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. It has also had the created influence on international cuisines, especially those from Southeast Asia, the British Isles and the Caribbean. The use of Indian spices, herbs and vegetable produce have helped shaped the cuisines of many countries around the world.\nIndian cuisine consists of the foods and dishes of India (and to some extent neighboring countries), is characterized by the extensive use of various Indian spices and vegetables grown across India, herbs, vegetables and fruits, and is also known for the widespread practice of vegetarianism in Indian society. Indian regional cuisine is primarily categorized at the regional level, but also at provincial levels. Cuisine differences various local cultures, geographical locations (whether a region is close to the sea, desert or the mountains), and economics. Indian cuisine is also seasonal, and utilizes fresh produce.\nThe cuisine of India is very diverse with each state having an entirely different food platter. The development of these cuisines have been shaped by Hindu and Jain beliefs, in particular vegetarianism which is a common dietary trend in Indian society. There has also been Islamic influence from the years of Mughal and Delhi Sultanate rule, as well as Persian interactions on North Indian and Deccani cuisine. Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies. Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played an important role in introducing certain food types and eating habits to the country. For instance, potato, a staple of North Indian diet was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chiles and breadfruit among other things. Spices were bought from India and traded in exchange for rubber and opium from Malacca.\n\n## Africa\n\n\n## Europe\n\n\n### France\n\n\n### Greece\nGreek cuisine includes more than 80 varieties of local cheeses that are often mixed with pastries and local pizza style cheese breads (spanakopita), is famous for an abundant usage of walnuts in sauces (tahini), salads, or other meat dishes.\n\n### Italy\nItaly's cuisine is one of the best-known cuisines in the world. As a Mediterranean cuisine, Italian cuisine makes heavy use of products based on wheat, olives, and grapes, with tomatoes being a distinguishing factor, and values using few but high-quality ingredients.\n\nFocaccia\nPasta\nPizza\nRisotto\n\n## North America\n\n\n### United States\nAmerican cuisine is a style of food preparation originating from the United States of America. European colonization of the Americas yielded the introduction of a number of ingredients and cooking styles to the latter. The various styles continued expanding well into the 19th and 20th centuries, proportional to the influx of immigrants from many foreign nations; such influx developed a rich diversity in food preparation throughout the country. Native American cuisine includes all food practices of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Modern-day native peoples retain a rich body of traditional foods, some of which have become iconic of present-day Native American social gatherings.\n\n### Mexico\nMexican cuisine, as well as Tex-Mex, has become widespread all over the world.\n\n### Canada\nCanadian cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices of Canada, with regional variances around the country.\n\n## South America\n\n\n## Oceania\n\n\n### Australia\n\n\n### Fiji\n\n\n### Marshall Islands\n\n\n### Micronesia\n\n\n### Nauru\n\n\n### New Zealand\n\n\n### Palau\nThe cuisine includes local foods such as cassava, taro, yam, potato, fish, and pork. It is also heavily influenced by Japanese, American, and Filipino cuisine, because of the significant presence of Filipino migrant workers. Fruit bat soup is a Palauan delicacy. Some local drinks include an alcoholic drink made from a coconut on the tree; a drink made from the roots of the kava; and the chewing of betel nuts. A dessert called tama was developed in Palau.\n\n### Papua New Guinean cuisine\nThe cuisine of Papua New Guinea are the traditional varied foods found in the eastern part of the New Guinea island. Approximately 80% of the population is reliant on subsistence agriculture, so a large percentage of food energy and protein consumed in Papua New Guinea is produced locally, while the balance is imported. The staple foods in the country includes root crops, bananas, and sago. Papua New Guinea's diet is largely vegetarian, especially in the Gulf and Highlands regions.\n\n### Samoa\n\n\n### Solomon Islands\n\n\n### Tonga\n\n\n### Tuvalu\n\n\n### Vanuatu\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nAlbala, Ken (2011).

    "text": "# Glutinous rice\n\nGlutinous rice (Oryza sativa var. glutinosa; also called sticky rice, sweet rice or waxy rice) is a type of rice grown mainly in Southeast Asia and the northeastern regions of South Asia, which has opaque grains and very low amylose content and is especially sticky when cooked. It is widely consumed across Asia.\nIt is called glutinous (Latin: glūtinōsus) in the sense of being glue-like or sticky, and not in the sense of containing gluten (which, like all rice, it does not). While often called sticky rice, it differs from non-glutinous strains of japonica rice, which also becomes sticky to some degree when cooked. There are numerous cultivars of glutinous rice, which include japonica, indica and tropical japonica strains.\n\n## History\nThe origin of glutinous rice is difficult to ascertain because of its long-standing cultural importance across a wide geographical region in Asia.\nA 2002 genetic study discovered that the waxy mutation that disrupted amylose synthesis likely has a single origin. This is supported by the fact that all glutinous rice accessions in the study contain the same mutation. From comparisons of subsequent mutations in the different accessions in the study, it was found that the progenitor haplotype is highest among Southeast Asian glutinous rice cultivars, indicating strongly that the waxy mutation first arose in Southeast Asia, likely in the upland regions of Mainland Southeast Asia, before spreading to the rest of Asia.\nThe waxy mutation is also known to have first arisen in temperate japonica rice, where it is far more common, before spreading to tropical japonica rice (javanica) and indica cultivars via gene flow.\n\n## Cultivation\nGlutinous rice is cultivated in countries across Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Asia, including Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Northeast India, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. In Laos, it is estimated that 85% of the rice produced is glutinous rice.\nAs of 2013, the International Rice Genebank (IRGC) has preserved approximately 6,530 varieties of glutinous rice from five continents—Asia, South America, North America, Europe, and Africa. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has referred to Laos as a \"collector's paradise\" for its remarkable diversity of glutinous rice. IRRI-trained collectors have gathered over 13,500 samples and 3,200 distinct varieties from Laos alone, making it home to the largest known biodiversity of sticky rice in the world.\n\n## Composition\nGlutinous rice is distinguished from other types of rice by having no (or negligible amounts of) amylose and high amounts of amylopectin (the two components of starch). Amylopectin is responsible for the sticky quality of glutinous rice. The difference has been traced to a single mutation that farmers selected.\nLike all types of rice, glutinous rice does not contain dietary gluten (i.e. does not contain glutenin and gliadin) and should be safe for gluten-free diets.\nGlutinous rice can be consumed milled or unmilled (that is, with the bran removed or not removed). Milled glutinous rice is white and fully opaque (unlike non-glutinous rice varieties, which are somewhat translucent when raw), whereas the bran can give unmilled glutinous rice a purple or black colour. Black and purple glutinous rice are distinct strains of white glutinous rice.  In developing Asia, there is little regulation, and some governments have issued advisories about toxic dyes being added to colour-adulterated rice. Both black and white glutinous rice can be cooked as discrete grains or ground into flour and cooked as a paste or gel.\n\n## Use in foods\nGlutinous rice is used in a wide variety of traditional dishes in different countries. They include the following:\n\n### Bangladesh\nEspecially in the eastern regions (Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Sylhet areas) of Bangladesh, glutinous rice is known as binni chal (Bangla: বিন্নি চাল) or binni sôil (বিন্নি চইল) in Chittagong, both meaning \"husked sticky rice\" in Bangla. Both white and pink varieties are cultivated at many homestead farms. Unhusked sticky rice is called binni dhan. Boiled or steamed binni chal is referred to as binni bhat. Served with a curry of fish or meat, binni bhat is a popular breakfast. Sometimes, it is eaten simply with a splash of date palm sugar or jaggery, salt, and shredded coconut. Binni dhan is also used to make khoi (popped rice similar to popcorn) and chida (flattened, beaten rice).\nMany other sweet items, or types of pitha, made with binni chal are also popular in the region.\nOne such pitha is atikka pitha. It is made with a mixture of cubed or thinly sliced coconut, white or brown sugar (specifically date palm sugar), ripe bananas, milk, and binni chal, all wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. A similar dessert is enjoyed throughout Southeast Asia, where it is known as khao tom mat in Thai, num ansom in Khmer, lepet in Indonesian, suman in Filipino, bánh tét and bánh chưng in Vietnamese, and khao tom in Lao.\nAnother sweet dish is binni chaler patishapta pitha, a rolled rice crepe made using coarsely ground, hydrated glutinous rice flour. The rice flour is spread in a thin circular layer over a hot pan and filled with a mixture of grated coconut, palm sugar, and occasionally milk powder, then rolled into shape.\nA kind of rice porridge made from binni chal is known as modhu bhat, which literally means \"honey rice\". It is prepared by cooking binni chal in water for a prolonged period until soft, slightly blending it for a creamy consistency, and then topping it with shredded coconut. Sweeteners such as date palm sugar and honey are also added. Modhu bhat is a well-known traditional delicacy of the Chittagong area, often consumed during cooler months or as part of rural celebrations.\n\n### Cambodia\nGlutinous rice is known as bay damnaeb (Khmer: បាយដំណើប) in Khmer.\nIn Cambodian cuisine, glutinous rice is primarily used for desserts and is an essential ingredient for most sweet dishes, such as ansom chek, kralan, and num ple aiy.\n\n### China\nIn Chinese, glutinous rice is known as nuòmǐ (糯米) or chu̍t-bí (秫米) in Hokkien.\nGlutinous rice is also often ground to make glutinous rice flour. This flour is made into niangao and sweet-filled dumplings called tangyuan, both of which are commonly eaten at Chinese New Year. It is also used as a thickener and for baking.\nGlutinous rice or glutinous rice flour are both used in many Chinese bakery products and in many varieties of dim sum. They produce a flexible, resilient dough, which can take on the flavours of other ingredients added to it. Cooking usually consists of steaming or boiling, sometimes followed by pan-frying or deep-frying. Sweet glutinous rice is sometimes eaten with red bean paste.\nNuòmǐfàn (simplified Chinese: 糯米饭; traditional Chinese: 糯米飯) is steamed glutinous rice usually cooked with Chinese sausage, chopped mushrooms, chopped barbecued pork, and optionally dried shrimp or scallop, depending on the preference.\nZòngzi (simplified Chinese: 粽子; traditional Chinese: 糭子/糉子) is a dumpling consisting of glutinous rice and sweet or savoury fillings wrapped in large flat leaves (usually bamboo), which is then boiled or steamed. It is most eaten during the Dragon Boat Festival but may be eaten at any time of the year. It is well known as an easily transported snack, or a meal to consume while travelling. It is a common food among Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia.\nZīfàn'gāo (simplified Chinese: 粢饭糕; traditional Chinese: 簢飯糕) is a well-known breakfast food originating in Eastern China consisting of cooked glutinous rice compressed into squares or rectangles, and then deep-fried. Additional seasoning and ingredients such as beans, zha cai, and sesame seeds may be added to the rice for added flavour. It has a similar appearance and external texture to hash browns.\nCífàntuán (simplified Chinese: 糍饭团; traditional Chinese: 糍飯糰) is another breakfast food consisting of a piece of youtiao tightly wrapped in cooked glutinous rice, sometimes with additional seasoning ingredients. Japanese onigiri resembles this Chinese food.\nLo mai gai (simplified Chinese: 糯米鸡; traditional Chinese: 糯米雞) is a dim sum dish, most often served in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, consisting of steamed glutinous rice with chicken in a lotus-leaf wrap.\nBābǎofàn (simplified Chinese: 八宝饭; traditional Chinese: 八寶飯; lit. 'eight treasure rice') is a dessert made from glutinous rice, steamed and mixed with lard, sugar, and eight kinds of fruits or nuts.\nA distinctive feature of the cuisine of the Hakka people of Southern China is its variety of steamed snack-type buns, dumplings, and patties made with a dough of coarsely ground rice, or ban , collectively known as \"rice snacks\". Some are filled with various salty or sweet ingredients.\nCommon examples of rice snacks made with ban from glutinous or sticky rice and non-glutinous rice include aiban (mugwort patty), caibao (yam bean bun), ziba (sticky rice balls) and bantiao (mianpaban or flat rice noodles).\nAiban encompasses several varieties of steamed patties and dumplings of various shapes and sizes, consisting of an outer layer made of glutinous ban dough filled with salty or sweet ingredients. It gets its name from the aromatic ai grass (mugwort), which, after being dried, powdered, and mixed with the ban, gives the dough a green colour and tea-like taste. Typical salty fillings include ground pork, mushrooms, and shredded white turnips. The most common sweet filling is made with red beans.\nCaibao is a generic term for all types of steamed buns with various sorts of filling. Hakka-style caibao are distinctive in that the enclosing skin is made with glutinous rice dough in place of wheat flour dough. Besides ground pork, mushrooms, and shredded turnips, fillings may include ingredients such as dried shrimp and dry fried-shallot flakes.\nZiba is glutinous rice dough that, after steaming in a large container, is mashed into a sticky, putty-like mass from which small patties are formed. After that, it is left to dry. When ready to eat, it is commonly fried, boiled or grilled. Then, it is usually coated with a layer of Chinese brown sugar syrup with sugary peanut or soybean powder. It has no filling.\n\n### Indonesia\nGlutinous rice is known as beras ketan or simply ketan in Java and most of Indonesia, and pulut in Sumatra. It is widely used as an ingredient for a wide variety of sweet, savoury, or fermented snacks. Glutinous rice is used as either hulled grains or milled into flour. It is usually mixed with santan, meaning coconut milk in Indonesian, along with a bit of salt to add some taste. Glutinous rice is rarely eaten as a staple. One example is lemang, which is glutinous rice and coconut milk cooked in bamboo stems lined by banana leaves. Glutinous rice is also sometimes used in a mix with normal rice in rice dishes such as nasi tumpeng or nasi tim. It is widely used during the Lebaran seasons as traditional food. It is also used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as tuak and brem bali.\n\n### Japan\nIn Japan, glutinous rice is known as mochigome (Japanese: もち米). It is used in traditional dishes such as sekihan also known as Red bean rice, okowa, and ohagi. It may also be ground into mochiko (もち粉), a rice flour, used to make mochi (もち), a kind of sweet rice cake. Mochi is traditionally prepared for the Japanese New Year, but can also be eaten year-round. Many different types of mochi exist from different regions, and they are normally flavoured with traditional ingredients such as red beans, water chestnuts, green tea, and pickled cherry flowers. See also Japanese rice.\n\n### Korea\nIn Korea, glutinous rice is called chapssal (Korean: 찹쌀), and its characteristic stickiness is called chalgi (찰기). Cooked rice made of glutinous rice is called chalbap (찰밥) and rice cakes (떡; ddeok) are called chalddeok or chapssalddeok (찰떡; 찹쌀떡). Chalbap is used as stuffing in samgyetang (삼계탕).\n\n### Laos\nAlong the Greater Mekong Sub-region, the Lao have been cultivating glutinous rice for approximately 4000 – 6000 years. Glutinous rice is the national dish of Laos. In Laos, a tiny landlocked nation with a population of approximately 7 million, per-capita sticky rice consumption is the highest on earth at 171 kg or 377 pounds per year.\nSticky rice is deeply ingrained in the culture, religious tradition, and national identity of Laos (see Lao cuisine). Sticky rice is considered the essence of what it means to be Lao. It has been said that no matter where they are in the world, sticky rice will always be the glue that holds the Lao communities together, connecting them to their culture and to Laos. Lao people often identify themselves as the \"children of sticky rice\" and if they did not eat sticky rice, they would not be Lao.\nSticky rice is known as khao niao (Lao:ເຂົ້າໜຽວ): khao means rice, and niao means sticky. It is cooked by soaking for several hours and then steaming in a bamboo basket or houat (Lao: ຫວດ). After that, it should be turned out on a clean surface and kneaded with a wooden paddle to release the steam; this results in rice balls that will stick to themselves but not to fingers. The large rice ball is kept in a small basket made of bamboo or thip khao (Lao:ຕິບເຂົ້າ). The rice is sticky but dry, rather than wet and gummy-like non-glutinous varieties. Laotians consume glutinous rice as part of their main diet; they also use toasted glutinous rice khao khoua (Lao:ເຂົ້າຄົ່ວ) to add a nut-like flavour to many dishes.  A popular Lao meal is a combination of larb (Lao:ລາບ), Lao grilled chicken ping gai (Lao:ປີ້ງໄກ່), spicy green papaya salad dish known as tam mak hoong (Lao:ຕຳໝາກຫູ່ງ), and sticky rice (khao niao).\n\nKhao lam (Lao:ເຂົ້າຫລາມ): sticky rice is mixed with coconut milk, red or black bean, or taro, and is filled in a bamboo tube. The tube is roasted until all the ingredients are cooked and blended together to give a sweet aromatic treat.

It is usually mixed with santan (coconut milk) along with a bit of salt to add some taste. It is widely used during the Raya festive seasons as traditional food which is shared with certain parts of Indonesia, such as:\n\nDodol – traditional sweets made of glutinous rice flour and coconut sugar. Similar variants are wajik (or wajit).\nInang-inang – glutinous rice cracker. Popular in Melaka.\nKelupis – a type of glutinous rice kuih in East Malaysia.\nKetupat – square-shaped crafts made from the same local leaves as palas, but it is usually filled with regular rice grains instead of pulut, though it depends on the maker.\nKochi – Malay-Peranakan sweet and sticky kuih.\nLamban – another type of glutinous rice dessert in East Malaysia.\nLemang – wrapped in banana leaves and inside a bamboo, and left to be barbecued/grilled on an open fire, to make the taste and texture tender and unique.\nPulut inti – wrapped in banana leaf in the shape of a pyramid, this kuih consists of glutinous rice with a covering of grated coconut candied with palm sugar.\nPulut panggang – glutinous rice parcels stuffed with a spiced filling, then wrapped in banana leaves and char-grilled. Depending on the regional tradition, the spiced filling may include pulverised dried prawns, caramelised coconut paste or beef floss. In the state of Sarawak, the local pulut panggang contains no fillings and is wrapped in pandan leaves instead.\nTapai – cooked glutinous rice fermented with yeast, wrapped in banana, rubber tree or roseapple leaves.\n\n### Myanmar\nGlutinous rice, called kao hnyin (ကောက်ညှင်း), is very popular in Myanmar (also known as Burma).\n\nKao hnyin baung (ကောက်ညှင်းပေါင်း) is a breakfast dish with boiled peas (pèbyouk) or with a variety of fritters, such as urad dal (baya gyaw), served on a banana leaf. It may be cooked wrapped in a banana leaf, often with peas, and served with a sprinkle of salted toasted sesame seeds and often grated coconut.\nThe purple variety, known as kao hynin ngacheik (ကောင်းညှင်းငချိမ့်), is equally popular cooked as ngacheik paung.\nThey may both be cooked and pounded into cakes with sesame called hkaw bouk, another favourite version in the north among the Shan and the Kachin, and served grilled or fried.\nThe Htamanè pwè festival (ထမနဲပွဲ) takes place on the full moon of Dabodwè(တပို့တွဲ) (February), when htamanè (ထမနဲ) is cooked in a huge wok.  Two men, each with a wooden spoon the size of an oar, and a third man coordinate the action of folding and stirring the contents, which include kao hnyin, ngacheik, coconut shavings, peanuts, sesame and ginger in peanut oil.\nSi htamin (ဆီထမင်း) is glutinous rice cooked with turmeric and onions in peanut oil, and served with toasted sesame and crisp-fried onions; it is a popular breakfast like kao hnyin baung and ngacheik paung.\nPaung din (ပေါင်းတင်) or \"Kao hyin kyi tauk\" (ကောင်းညှင်းကျည်တောက်) is another ready-to-eat portable form cooked in a segment of bamboo.  When the bamboo is peeled off, a thin skin remains around the rice and also gives off a distinctive aroma.\n\nMont let kauk  (မုန့်လက်ကောက်) is made from glutinous rice flour; it is donut-shaped and fried like baya gyaw, but eaten with a dip of jaggery or palm sugar syrup.\nNga pyaw douk (ငပျောထုပ်) or \"Kao hynin htope\" (ကောင်းညှင်းထုပ်), banana in glutinous rice, wrapped in banana leaf and steamed and served with grated coconut – another favourite snack, like kao hnyin baung and mont let kauk,  sold by street hawkers.\nMont lone yay baw (မုန့်လုံးရေပေါ်) are glutinous rice balls with jaggery inside, thrown into boiling water in a huge wok, and ready to serve as soon as they resurface. Their preparation is a tradition during Thingyan, the Burmese New Year festival.\nHtoe mont (ထိုးမုန့်), glutinous rice cake with raisins, cashews and coconut shavings, is a traditional dessert for special occasions. It is appreciated as a gift item from Mandalay.\n\n### Nepal\nIn Nepal, Latte/Chamre is a popular dish made from glutinous rice during Teej festival, the greatest festival of Nepalese women.\n\n### Northeastern India\nSticky rice called bora saul is the core component of indigenous Assamese sweets, snacks, and breakfast. This rice is widely used in the traditional sweets of Assam, which are very different from the traditional sweets of India whose basic component is milk.\nSuch traditional sweets in Assam are Pitha (Narikolor pitha, Til pitha, Ghila pitha, Tel pitha, Keteli pitha, Sunga pitha, Sunga saul etc.).  Also, its powder form is used as breakfast or other light meals directly with milk. They are called Pitha guri (if the powder was done without frying the rice, by just crushing it after soaking) or Handoh guri (if rice is dry fried first, and then crushed).\nThe soaked rice is also cooked with no added water inside a special kind of bamboo (called sunga saul bnaah). This meal is called sunga saul.\nDuring religious ceremonies, indigenous Assamese communities make Mithoi (Kesa mithoi and Poka mithoi) using Gnud with it. Sometimes Bhog, Payokh are also made from it using milk and sugar with it.\nDifferent indigenous Assamese communities make rice beer from sticky rice, preferring it over other varieties of rice for the sweeter and more alcoholic result. This rice beer is also offered to their gods and ancestors. Rice cooked with it is also taken directly as lunch or dinner on rare occasions.\nSimilarly, other indigenous communities from NE India use sticky rice in various forms similar to the native Assamese style in their cuisine.\n\n### Philippines\nIn the Philippines, glutinous rice is known as malagkit in Tagalog or pilit in Visayan, among other names such as diket in Ilocano. Both mean \"sticky\". The most common way glutinous rice is prepared in the Philippines is by soaking uncooked glutinous rice in water or coconut milk (usually overnight) and then grinding it into a thick paste (traditionally with stone mills). This produces a rich and smooth viscous rice dough known as galapóng, which is the basis for numerous rice cakes in the Philippines. However, in modern preparation methods, galapong is sometimes made directly from dry glutinous rice flour (or from commercial Japanese mochiko), with poorer-quality results.\nGalapong was traditionally allowed to ferment, which is still required for certain dishes. A small amount of starter culture of microorganisms (tapay or bubod) or palm wine (tubâ) may be traditionally added to rice being soaked to hasten the fermentation. These can be substituted with yeast or baking soda in modern versions. Other versions of galapong may also be treated with wood ash lye.\nAside from the numerous white and red glutinous rice cultivars, the most widely used glutinous rice heirloom cultivars in the Philippines are tapol rice, which is milky white in colour, and pirurutong rice, which ranges in colour from black to purple to reddish brown. However both varieties are expensive and becoming increasingly rare, thus some Filipino recipes nowadays substitute it with dyed regular glutinous rice or infuse purple yam (ube) to achieve the same colouration.\nDessert delicacies in the Philippines are known as kakanin (from kanin, \"prepared rice\"). These were originally made primarily from rice, but in recent centuries, the term has come to encompass dishes made from other types of flour, including corn flour (masa), cassava, wheat, and so on.  Glutinous rice figures prominently in two main subtypes of kakanin: the puto (steamed rice cakes), and the bibingka (baked rice cakes). Both largely utilize glutinous rice galapong. A notable variant of puto is puto bumbong, which is made with pirurutong.\nOther kakanin that use glutinous rice include suman, biko, and sapin-sapin among others. There is also a special class of boiled galapong dishes like palitaw, moche, mache, and masi. Fried galapong is also used to make various types of buchi, which are the local Chinese-Filipino versions of jian dui. They are also used to make puso, which are boiled rice cakes in woven leaf pouches.\nAside from kakanin, glutinous rice is also used in traditional Filipino rice gruels or porridges known as lugaw. They include both savory versions like arroz caldo or goto which are similar to Chinese-style congee; and dessert versions like champorado, binignit, and ginataang mais.\n\n### Thailand\nIn Thailand, glutinous rice is known as khao niao (Thai: ข้าวเหนียว; lit. 'sticky rice') in central Thailand and Isan, and as khao nueng (Thai: ข้าวนึ่ง; lit. 'steamed rice') in northern Thailand. Sticky rice at the table is typically served individually in a small woven basket  (Thai: กระติบข้าว, RTGS: kratip khao).\n\nSteamed glutinous rice is one of the main ingredients in making the sour-fermented pork skinless sausage called naem, or its northern Thai equivalent chin som, which can be made from pork, beef, or water buffalo meat. It is also essential for the fermentation process in the northeastern Thai sausage called sai krok Isan. This latter sausage is made, in contrast to the first two, with a sausage casing.\nSweets and desserts: Famous among tourists in Thailand is khao niao mamuang (Thai: ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง): sweet coconut sticky rice with mango, while khao niao tat, sweet sticky rice with coconut cream and black beans, Khao niao na krachik (Thai: ข้าวเหนียวหน้ากระฉีก), sweet sticky rice topped with caramelized roasted grated coconut, khao niao kaeo, sticky rice cooked in coconut milk and sugar and khao tom hua ngok, sticky rice steamed with banana with grated coconut and sugar, are traditional popular desserts.\nKhao lam (Thai: ข้าวหลาม) is sticky rice with sugar and coconut cream cooked in specially prepared bamboo sections of different diameters and lengths. It can be prepared with white or dark purple (khao niao dam) varieties of glutinous rice. Sometimes a few beans or nuts are added and mixed in. Thick khao lam containers may have a custard-like filling in the centre made with coconut cream, egg and sugar.\nKhao chi (Thai: ข้าวจี่) are cakes of sticky rice having the size and shape of a patty and a crunchy crust. In order to prepare them, the glutinous rice is laced with salt, often also lightly coated with beaten egg, and grilled over a charcoal fire. They were traditionally made with leftover rice and given in the early morning to the children, or to passing monks as an offering.\nKhao niew tua dum is a sticky with sugar, thickened coconut milk and black beans.\nKhao pong (Thai: ข้าวโป่ง) is a crunchy preparation made of leftover steamed glutinous rice that is pounded and pressed into thin sheets before being grilled.\nKhao tom mat (Thai: ข้าวต้มมัด), cooked sticky rice mixed with banana and wrapped in banana leaf, khao ho, sticky rice moulded and wrapped in a conical shape, khao pradap din, kraya sat and khao thip are preparations based on glutinous rice used as offerings in religious festivals and ceremonies for merit-making or warding off evil spirits.\nKhao niao ping (Thai: ข้าวเหนียวปิ้ง), sticky rice mixed with coconut milk and taro (khao niao ping pheuak), banana (khao niao ping kluai) or black beans (khao niao ping tua), wrapped in banana leaf and grilled slowly over a charcoal fire. Glutinous rice is traditionally eaten using the right hand\nKhao khua (Thai: ข้าวคั่ว), roasted ground glutinous rice, is indispensable for making the northeastern Thai dishes larb, nam tok, and nam chim chaeo. Some recipes also ask for khao khua in certain northern Thai curries. It imparts a nutty flavour to the dishes in which it is used.\nNaem khluk (Thai: ยำแหนม) or yam naem khao thot is a salad made from crumbled deep-fried, curried-rice croquettes, and naem sausage\nChin som mok is a northern Thai speciality made with grilled, banana leaf-wrapped pork skin that has been fermented with glutinous rice\nSai krok Isan: grilled, fermented pork sausages, a speciality of northeastern Thailand\nGlutinous rice is also used as the basis for the brewing of sato (Thai: สาโท), an alcoholic beverage also known as \"Thai rice wine\".\n\n### Vietnam\nGlutinous rice is called gạo nếp in Vietnamese. The term for the cooked rice is called xôi. Dishes made from glutinous rice in Vietnam are typically served as desserts or side dishes, but some can be served as main dishes. There is a wide array of glutinous rice dishes in Vietnamese cuisine, the majority of them can be categorized as follows:\n\nBánh, the most diverse category, refers to a wide variety of sweet or savoury, distinct cakes, buns, pastries, sandwiches, and food items from Vietnamese cuisine, which may be cooked by steaming, baking, frying, deep-frying, or boiling. Some, but not all bánh are made from glutinous rice. They can also be made from ordinary rice flour, cassava flour, taro flour, or tapioca starch. The word \"bánh\" is also used to refer to certain varieties of noodles in Vietnam, and absolutely not to be confused with glutinous rice dishes. Some bánh dishes that are made from glutinous rice include:\nBánh chưng: a square-shaped, boiled glutinous rice dumpling filled with pork and mung bean paste, wrapped in a dong leaf, usually eaten in Vietnamese New Year.\nBánh giầy: white, flat, round glutinous rice cake with a tough, chewy texture filled with mung bean or served with Vietnamese sausage (chả), usually eaten during Vietnamese New Year with bánh chưng.\nBánh dừa: glutinous rice mixed with black bean paste cooked in coconut juice, wrapped in a coconut leaf.

    "text": "# Goan cuisine\n\nGoan cuisine consists of regional foods popular in Goa, India. Rice, seafood, coconut, vegetables, meat, bread, pork and local spices are staples of  Goan cuisine. Use of kokum and vinegar is another distinct feature. Goan food is considered incomplete without fish.\nThe cuisine of Goa originated from its Konkani roots, and was influenced by the 451 years of Portuguese rule and the Sultanate rule that preceded the Portuguese. Many Catholic dishes are either similar to or variants of their Portuguese counterparts in both naming or their use of ingredients.\n\n## Seafood\nThe cuisine of Goan people is mostly seafood-based; the staple foods are rice and fish. Kingfish (Visvonn विस्वण or Isvonn इस्वण) is one of the most commonly eaten varieties of fish. Other fish varieties include pomfret, shark, tuna, sardines, and mackerel. Among the shellfish are crabs, prawns, tiger prawns, lobster, squid, and mussels. The cuisine of Goan Catholics is heavily influenced by Portuguese cuisine. The use of vinegar, for example, is very prominent, specifically toddy vinegar, which is made from coconut sap that is retrieved from stems, and is then left to  ferment for four  to six months.\n\n## Introduction of new foods\nThe Portuguese introduced cashew nuts (now cultivated widely and popularly known as Goa cashews), pineapples, guavas, potatoes, and tomatoes from Latin America to Goa, and consequently the rest of India. Chillies are the most important aspect of Goan cuisine; they were introduced by the Portuguese and became very popular in wider Indian cuisine. One of Goa's beloved dishes is called sorpotel, which is made from pork. A classic example of Portuguese influence on the food of Goa is that the cuisine includes vinegar, an otherwise uncommon ingredient in traditional Indian cooking. Before the coming of the Portuguese, the Goan diet used to include flatbreads such as rotis and chappatis. The Portuguese brought with them the distinctive bread known as pão. Since then, bread has become an integral part of the diet for Goans.\n\n## Goan Hindu cuisine\nGoan Hindu cuisine in Goa is mainly pescetarian and lacto-vegetarian, from which it originates. Goan Hindu cuisine is mild, with use of  tamarind and kokum for souring, and jaggery for sweetening. It uses spices such as asafoetida, fenugreek, curry leaves, mustard, and urad dal. Onion and garlic are also used. It also includes vegetables, such as lentils, pumpkins, gourds, bamboo shoots, and roots. The medium of cooking is coconut oil.\nWell-known Goan Hindu dishes include:\n\nHumann (हुमण) — Fish curry, also known as kadī (कडी) or āmbat (आंबट), with steamed rice (शीत/भात)\nFried fish (तळील्लें नूस्तें)\nFish suke (सुकें नूस्तें) or dhabdhabit — Dry spicy preparation of fish, served as a side dish\nFish udid methi/uddamethi (उद्दमेथी) — Curry consisting of fenugreek and mackerel; a vegetarian version of this dish is also prepared using hog plums (or anything sour and tangy, such as pieces of raw mango)\nKismur (किस्मुर) — A side dish normally consisting of dried fish (mostly mackerel or shrimp), onions, and coconut\nSungtache dangar (डांगर) — Goan prawn cutlets\nKalputi — A dish normally prepared from the head of a large fish, with onions and coconut\nBhājī/shāk (भाजी/शाक) — A generic term for stews, curries, and stir-fried dishes made from different vegetables and fruits\nBhaji — Fried fritters with besan (chickpea) batter. Different kind of bhajis can be made by changing the vegetable used with the besan. Common bhajis include those containing onion or chilies.\nKhatkhate (ख़तखतें)\nVaran — A lentil preparation often made with coconut milk tempered with mustard, curry leaves, and chilies, served as an accompaniment to rice for the Naivedya, prepared during all Hindu festivals, and an integral part of wedding feasts.\nTondāk (तोंडाक) — A dish with beans and cashews  as the primary ingredients\nDifferent varieties of sweets made from rice and lentils, such as payasu, patoli, madgane and kheer. (गोड्शें)\nDifferent varieties of pickles and papads (लोणचे आनी पापड)\nSolanchi kadi (सोलांची कडी) — A spicy coconut and kokum curry\n\n## Goan Catholic cuisine\nGoan Catholic cuisine in Goa is a fusion of Goan Hindu and Portuguese cooking styles. Vinegar (made from the toddy of local coconut trees) is used to give a tangy taste to the meat dishes.\n\n### Main dishes\nCommon Goan Catholic dishes include:\n\nAmbott tîk — A spicy and sour curry prepared with fish.\nJeerem-meerem — A spicer, less sour version of the above.\nBalchanv (balichão) — A pickled curry made with prawns.\nMol (mole de peixe) — A pickled curry made with fish.\nCafreal — A masala marinade mostly used for chicken or fish made from coriander leaves, green chilies, and other spices.\nCanja de galinha – A type of chicken broth served with rice and chicken.\nChamuça — A Goan/Portuguese derivative of the samosa.\nChoris (chouriço) — A spicy pork sausage.\nCroquettes — Fried minced beef rolls, a common snack among Goan Catholics and the Portuguese.\nFeijoada — A stew brought by the Portuguese. It is made with meat (beef or pork), beans, and cabbage.\nGoan soup\nRoast beef and beef tongue — Commonly served entrees at Goan celebrations.\nRos omelette — An omelette drowned in spicy chicken or chickpea gravy and served with pão (Luso-Goan bread)\nSamarachi koddi — Goan curry made with fresh and dried prawns\nSanna – A moist spongy rice cake; a variant of idli\nSolantule kodi — A picquant coconut milk and kokum curry\nSorpotel (Sarapatel) — A very spicy pork dish eaten with sannas or pão (Goan bread – spelled the same way as in Portugal)\nVindalho — A spicy curry traditionally made with pork. The name is derived from the Portuguese term for ‘garlic’ and ‘wine’ (“vinho e alho” or “vinha d'alhos”) marinade. Contrary to popular versions made outside Goa, a traditional vindalho does not contain any meat besides pork. It also does not contain any potatoes nor is its name related to the Hindi word ‘āloo’ (potato).\nXacuti (Shâgotî) — Type of curry made with roasted grated coconut and pieces of chicken or lamb.\n\nBread is an important part of Goan cuisine. Of Portuguese origin, it is different in Goa from the breads offered in the rest of India. It was around 1550, in the village of Salcete, that the Portuguese began to teach the local population how to prepare these breads. They often include palm wine (‘’toddy‘’) used as a ferment. Local breads include:\n\npao (the most common bread, with a brioche-like texture),\nkatre pao (a square loaf with pointed corners),\nundo (a soft bread with a real crust),\nkankonn (a round loaf with holes, shaped like a bagel but with a larger diameter; it keeps for a long time),\nand poie, a type of farmhouse bread with an airy crumb.\n\n### Sweets and desserts\nSweets and desserts are known by their Konkani name, ‘Goddxem’. Popular dishes include:\n\nArroz doce — A Portuguese sweetened rice custard.\nBêbîk (Bebinca) — A multi-layered baked pudding traditionally eaten at Christmas.\nCashew laddus\nnevryo-Sweet fried dumpling with filling made from grated coconut, sugar, poppy seeds, green cardamom, almonds\nkhaje\nrevdyo\nsakharbhat -Rice with sugar and coconut\nmadgane\npayasa\nhalwa dali kapa (halwa made from red gram), cashew halwa, mango halwa, banana halwa, pumpkin halwa\nDodol\nBebinca\nPatoleo or patoli – A dish of turmeric leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, and coconut\nSerradura\nKuswar\nPerada\n\n## See also\nCanja de Goa\nCucumber cake\nFeni\nUrrak\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

North Gujarat, Kathiawad, Kachchh, Central Gujarat and South Gujarat are the five major regions of Gujarat that contribute their unique touch to Gujarati cuisine. Many Gujarati dishes are distinctively sweet, salty, and spicy commonly.\nDespite easy access to plentiful seafood due to a long coastline, Gujarat is primarily a vegetarian state. Many communities such as Koli Patel, Ghanchi, Muslim communities and Parsis, however, do include seafood, chicken and mutton in their diet.\n\n## Staple foods\nStaples include homemade khichdi (rice and lentils or rice and mung beans), chaas (buttermilk), and pickles as side.  Main dishes are based on steam cooked vegetables with different spices and dals that are added to a vaghar, which is a mixture of spices heated in oil that varies depending on the main ingredients. Salt, sugar, lemon, lime, and tomatoes are used frequently to prevent dehydration in an area where temperatures reach 50 °C (122 °F) in the shade.  It is common to add a little sugar or jaggery to some of the vegetable dishes and dal, which adds sweetness to the often savory and spicy dishes.\n\nThe cuisine changes with the seasonal availability of vegetables.  In summer, when mangoes are ripe and widely available in the market, for example, Keri no Ras (fresh mango pulp) is often an integral part of the meal.  The spices used also change depending on the season.  Garam masala and its constituent spices are used less in summer.  Regular fasting, with diets limited to milk, dried fruits, and nuts, is commonplace.\nGujaratis are predominantly vegetarians, even though pockets of the state consume chicken, eggs and fish.\nFlat bread prepared with Bajra has nutritional value similar to other foods based on flours. Common meals in villages near Saurashtra during the cold winters consists of thick rotis, called \"rotla\" made of bajra flour (pearl millet flour) and \"bhakri\" made of wheat flour, garlic chutney, onion, and chaas.\nSweets (desserts) served as part of a thali are typically made from milk, sugar, and nuts. \"Dry\" sweets such as magas and ghooghra are typically made around celebrations, such as weddings, or at Diwali.\nGujarati cuisine is also distinctive in its wide variety of farsan — side dishes that complement the main meal and are served alongside it.  Some farsan are eaten as snacks or light meals by themselves.\nGujaratis will often refer to dal-bhat-rotli-saak as their everyday meal. For special occasions, this basic quartet is supplemented with additional shaak, sweet dishes, and farsan.  A festive Gujarati thali often contain over a dozen items. Dietary rules restrict the permissible combination of dishes.  For example, if kadhi is to be served, then a lentil preparation such as chutti dal, vaal, or mug ni dal will also be included.  The sweet dish accompanying kadhi will likely be milk or yogurt–based, like doodhpak or shrikhand.  However, a yogurt-based raita would not be served with such a meal.  Festive meals based on dal will typically have a wheat-based sweet dish like lapsi or ladoo as the sweet accompaniment.  Many Gujarati families make and consume moong dal in their diet on Wednesdays. There are established combinations of spices that some believe to facilitate digestion, that are eaten with different foods.\nGujarati thali is sometimes seen as being \"no-frills\" even though it can be elaborate. India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi has often arranged Gujarati food for his special overseas guests like Shinzo Abe or Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa. Modi himself has been said to prefer Khichdi, even when visiting overseas, something that opposing politicians sometimes mocked.\n\n## Sub-regional cuisines\n\n\n### Coastal Gujarat\nIn coastal Gujarat, the Kharwa community has developed a cuisine consisting of fresh and dried fish.  Common seafood are pomfrets, khandwas, gedadas, surmai, prawns, crabs, lobster, and narsinga (calamari).\n\n### Khathiawar\nGujarati cuisine varies in flavour and other aspects from region to region. One can notice that food from Surat, Kutch, Kathiawad and North Gujarat are the most distinct ones. Tastes also differ according to family preferences. Most popular Gujarati dishes have a sweet taste, as traditionally, sugar or jaggery is added to most Gujarati food items, like vegetables and dal. Additionally, Gujarati food is cooked in unique ways, with some dishes being stir-fried while others are steam cooked, with vegetables and spices or dal being boiled and later vaghar/chaunk (fried spices) being added to it to enhance the flavour.\n\n## List of Gujarati vegetarian dishes\n\n\n### Breads\nRotla (બાજરીનો રોટલો): Thick millet flour flatbread usually grilled over coals in clay pan.\nMakai no rotlo: Thick maize flour flatbread usually grilled over coals in clay pan.\nBhakri: Made with whole wheat flour, thicker than rotli.\nPhulka rotli (also called rotli or chapati): Made with whole wheat flour, rolled thin.\nJuvar no rotlo: Thick sorghum flatbread.\nParotha: Shallow-fried whole wheat flatbread.\nPuri: Made with whole wheat flour, deep-fried.\nThepla or dhebra (થેપલા/ઢેબરા): Made with a mixture of flours, pan-fried, mildly spiced, usually contains shredded vegetables.\nPoodla (sweet): Made with a mixture of flours, pan-fried.\nRajgira ni puri\n\n### Rice\nIn addition to plain rice, Gujarati cuisine also includes rice based dishes such as:\n\nBiranji: Steamed rice flavoured with saffron, sugar, and dried fruit.\nKhatta-mittha bhaat (sour and sweet rice): Rice, boiled with potatoes and spices, yellow in colour and accompanied with lemon peel.\nVagharelo bhaat: Aromatic tempered rice using various spices.\nDoodhpak: Rice pudding made by boiling rice with milk and sugar, and flavoured with cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios, or almonds.

    "text": "# Guyanese cuisine\n\nGuyanese cuisine is a fusion of indigenous, African, Indian, Portuguese, Chinese, and European (primarily British) culinary traditions, reflecting the country's multicultural heritage. Staples include one-pot meals, richly spiced stews, curries with roti, and a variety of fried breads and pastries, all enlivened by the use of local herbs and hot peppers.\n\n## Main meals\n\n\n### Breakfast dishes\nA typical Guyanese breakfast may feature bakes (fried breads) served with saltfish, known locally as bake and saltfish. Other options include fried rice or Guayanese chow mein, especially as leftovers. On Christmas mornings, families enjoy Guyanese pepperpot with homemade bread. The key ingredient in pepperpot is cassareep, a syrup made from bitter cassava that also serves as a preservative.\n\nIndo-Guyanese options include sada roti with fried eggs or dal. Porridges made from cornmeal or oats and dishes like plantain and eggs are common.\n\n### Lunch and dinner\nLunches and dinners commonly feature curry and roti, such as dhalpuri, oil roti, and aloo roti. Curries are made with garlic, cumin, garam masala, and other spices.\nCreole dishes include cook-up rice, a one-pot meal of rice, beans, coconut milk, and meats such as pig tail or salted beef. Metemgee, a stew of root vegetables, plantains, coconut milk, and dumplings, is rooted in African and Amerindian traditions.\nChinese influences are seen in Guyanese fried rice and Guyanese chow mein, adapted with Caribbean spices and ingredients. Lo mein and other stir-fries are also popular. Colonial legacies include macaroni pie, baked meats, souse, and black pudding.\n\n### Street foods and snacks\nCommon street foods include pholourie, egg ball, cassava ball, saltfish cakes, and doubles. Chinese-style snacks such as wontons and egg rolls are sold by roadside vendors.\n\n### Festive foods\nChristmas dishes include Guyanese pepperpot, garlic pork (of Portuguese origin), and black cake. During Eid al-Fitr, Diwali, and Phagwah, Indo-Guyanese communities prepare sweets such as sawine, gulab jamun, mithai, and parsad. Cook-up rice and soups are prepared for Emancipation Day and Old Year's Night.\n\n## Sweets and pastries\nDesserts include salara, pine tart, cheese rolls, and cassava pone. Chinese cake, a variation of mooncake made with black-eyed peas, reflects Chinese heritage. British-style cakes like pound cake and Victoria sponge are also common.\n\n## Beverages\nPopular drinks include mauby, sorrel drink, ginger beer, peanut punch, and lime wash. El Dorado rum—produced by Demera Distillers Ltd—is internationally acclaimed. Banks Beer, kasiri, and parakari (indigenous cassava-based alcohols) are popular.\n\n## See also\nTrinidad and Tobago cuisine\nCaribbean Chinese cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nRickford, John R.

The restaurant also sells borhani (a salted mint drink made of yogurt) and soft drinks. In 1939, the restaurant was started as a roadside food corner by a person named Haji Mohammad Hossain. Later on, the business took dramatic change and became part of the culture of Dhaka city.\n\n## History\nThe business was started in 1939 by a cook, Haji Mohammad Hossain. After Haji Mohammad Hossain died in 1992, his son, Haji Mohammad Golam Hossain, took over and continued the family business without making any changes in style or tradition. Over time, Haji Mohammad Golam became tired of running the family business and finally handed over the business to his son, Haji Mohammad Shahed. The dish bears resemblance to the Yemeni haneeth.\n\n## Location\nThe Haji biryani has three branches. One is in Old Dhaka which is the main branch, one is in Motijheel, Another branch is said to be planned in Jamuna Future Park. In Old Dhaka, it is located at 70 Kazi Alauddin Road, Nazira Bazar.\n\n## Recipe\nThe recipe includes highly seasoned rice, chevon, mustard oil, garlic, onion, black pepper, saffron, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, lemon, doi (yogurt), peanuts, cream, raisin and small amount of cheese (either cow or buffalo). The recipe has been handed over the founder of the restaurant to his next generation. Haji Mohammad Shahed claimed that, \"I have never changed anything, not even the amount of salt\".\n\n## See also\nMadhur Canteen\nStar Kabab\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\n\"A Mouthful of Happiness\".

It was the favourite of the god Indra. Kautilya has mentioned two intoxicating beverages made from rice called Medaka and Prasanna. Megasthenes, the Greek Ambassador to Maurya Emperor Chandragupta Maurya wrote about rice beer in his book Indica where he mentioned that Indians made wine from rice instead of barley. He mentioned that Indians never drank rice wine except during sacrifice.\n\n## Preparation\nThe making involves the use of ranu tablets, which is essentially a combination of about 20-25 herbs and acts as a fermentor. These ranu tablets help in the preparation of many other beverages as well. The ranu tablets are then mixed with boiled rice and left to ferment in earthen pots. The drink is generally ready within a week. It is served cool and has lower alcoholic strength than other Indian country liquors.\nEarlier it was only used in marriage functions and feasts, but it has since been commercialised, as people started selling it daily due to economic reasons.\n\n## See also\nAmazake\nChhaang\nList of Indian drinks\nMahuli\nNigori\nRice wine\nRelated beverages\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nSatpathy, Nirupama; Rashmi Ranjan Satpathy. \"Handia: The Source of Livelihood of Tribal Women A Case Study on Munda Women in Keonjhar District, Orissa\".

    "text": "# Hyderabadi biryani\n\nHyderabadi biryani (also known as Hyderabadi dum biryani) is a style of biryani originating from Hyderabad, India made with basmati rice and meat (mostly goat meat). Originating in the kitchens of the Nizam of Hyderabad, it combines elements of Hyderabadi and Mughlai cuisines. Hyderabad biryani is a key dish in Hyderabadi cuisine and it is so famous that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.\n\n## History\nHyderabad was conquered by the Mughals in the 1630s, and ruled by its Nizams. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create Hyderabadi cuisine.  Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition. In 1857, when the Mughal Empire declined in Delhi, Hyderabad emerged as the center of South Asian culture, resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.\n\n### Origin\nThe exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to South Asia by Arab traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. The distinction between \"pulao\" and \"biryani\" is arbitrary. Hyderabadi biryani incorporated Deccani or Telangana flavors of, perhaps in the Nizam's kitchen.\n\n## Ingredients\nBase ingredients are basmati rice, meat (usually goat, but sometimes also chicken or beef), dahi, fried onion and ghee. Spices include cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (elaichi), bay leaves, nutmeg, papaya paste, caraway (shahi jeera), mace flower (javitri), star anise (biryani flower), lemon, and saffron.\nHyderabadi biryani is of two types: the kachchi (raw) biryani, and the pakki (cooked) biryani.\n\n### Kachche-gosht ki biryani\nThe kachchi biryani is prepared with kachchi gosht (raw meat) marinated with spices overnight and then soaked in curd (dahi) before cooking. The meat is sandwiched between layers of fragrant basmati rice and cooked \"in dum\" after sealing the handi (vessel) with dough. This is a challenging process as it requires meticulous attention to time and temperature to avoid over- or under-cooking the meat.\n\n### Vegetable dum biryani\nThe vegetable biryani is prepared with mixed vegetables in a similar manner to dum biryani with meat.  It is suitable for vegetarians.\n\n## Accompaniments\nA biryani is usually served with dahi chutney and mirchi ka salan. Baghaar-e-baingan is a common side dish. The salad includes onion, carrot, cucumber, and lemon wedges.\n\n## See also\nHyderabadi cuisine\nHyderabadi haleem\nTravancore biriyani\nBiriyani\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nA Princely Legacy, Hyderabadi Cuisine by Pratibha Karan.

The category to which the recipe belongs itself speaks of different things like the time required to prepare the food, the shelf life of the prepared item, etc.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Medieval period\nThe Deccan Plateau in which Hyderabad is located is a large inland region in India. Its cuisine was largely local and traditional until the days of the Vijayanagara Empire. When Muhammad bin Tughluq moved the capital of his dominion from Delhi to Daulatabad, the region was exposed to and adopted dishes from other areas. This grew to include influences from Turkish cuisine when in the 14th century when the Bahmani Sultanate was formed and turkish nobles were appointed to high positions in the region's government.\nTwo centuries of inbound migration accompanying great political and cultural change introduced further culinary influences to the region.\nIn Deccan medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared and served in Dastarkhān style, placed on a long cloth laid on the floor. Food was generally eaten without utensils, both by nobility and the general population. Dishes based on meat became more common and the use of spices increased. Fresh fruit became a commmon dessert. A drink of Kahwa became a popular digestive. Ingredients used in dishes varied according to the seasons and festivals, and many items were preserved in the form of pickles.\n\n### Modern period\nThe modern cuisine was evolved during the Nizams in the mid-17th century, and elevated to a sublime art form. Hyderabad has a history of continuous influx of migrants from all over the world and in general from the Indian sub-continent, particularly since 1857. Most of the foreign food had been improved to suit the culinary preferences, resulting to form the unique derivative cuisine that excels over the original. Biryani and Haleem (Arabic) for instance is prepared all over India, but the Hyderabadi variety is ultimately from the Hyderabadi Biryani and Hyderabadi Haleem. Til ke chatuni with Arabic tahini, Persian dried lamb with beans is modified with dalcha, tandoori naan of Uzbek (Central Asia) to create Sheermal. Most of the modern day desserts in Hyderabadi cuisine were introduced and invented during the times of Nizams, today that had become an integral part of cuisine.\nHyderabadi cuisine is an integral part of the cuisines of the former Hyderabad State that includes the state of Telangana and the regions of Marathwada (now in Maharashtra) and Kalyana-Karanataka (now in Karnataka). The Hyderabadi cuisine contains city-specific specialties like Hyderabad (Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi Haleem) and Aurangabad (Naan Qalia), Parbhani (Biryani and Tahari), Bidar (Kalyani Biryani) and others. The use of dry coconut, tamarind, and red chillies along with other spices are the main ingredients that make Hyderabadi cuisine different from the North Indian cuisine.\n\n## Course\nHyderabadi dinner also known as Dastarkhwan are usually of five course meal; Aghaz (Soup), Mezban (appetizers), Waqfa (Sorbet), Mashgool Dastarkhwan (Main course) and Zauq-e-shahi (dessert).\n\n## Starters\n\n\n### Lukhmi\nLukhmi is a regional non-vegetarian variation of the samosa, though it is shaped into a flat square patty. It is made from flour and stuffed with minced mutton or beef, known as kheema. It is eaten as an evening snack or served as a starter at celebrations.\n\n### Murtabak\nMurtabak is often described as spicy folded omelette pancake with bits of vegetables. It is the most common form of Murtabak; which is egg-filled pancake, sometimes mixed with green onion and minced meat, made from pan fried crepes which is folded and cut to squares.\n\n### Hyderabadi Haleem\nHyderabadi Haleem is a popular dish of Hyderabad. It is a stew composed of mutton, lentils, spices and wheat. It originates from Harees, an Arab dish brought to Hyderabad by Arab migrants. Harees is still prepared in its original form in Barkas. It is sometimes served as a starter at celebrations, but it is usually only prepared during the month of Ramadan for the Iftar meal.\n\n### Biryani\nHyderabadi Biryani is one of the most popular dishes of the city. It is distinctly different from other variations of the Biryani, originating from the kitchens of the Nizams of Hyderabad. It is a celebration dish of basmati rice and mutton, along with yoghurt, onions and various spices. It is a key dish to the cuisine and it is said that the dish is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.\n\n### Variants\nKalyani Biryani is a variant of the Hyderabadi Biryani using beef instead of lamb or mutton. This meal was started after Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera (cumin), dhania (coriander) flavour.\nTahari, made by the  Hyderabadi Muslims is a rice and meat dish. Unlike biryani in which rice is precooked and then layered with meat, rice in tahari is cooked in meat. Occasionally vegetables, more commonly potatoes, are also added. It is served with dahi ki chutney.\n\n## Other dishes\n\n\n### Pathar-ka-gosht\nPathar-ka-gosht is a mutton kebab. It is named for the traditional method of preparation, on a stone slab. (Pathar means 'stone' in Urdu as well as Hindi.)\n\n### Hyderabadi khichdi\nThe Hyderabadi version of khichdi is distinct from the many variants in other parts of India. It is eaten with kheema (minced mutton curry). It is consumed as a breakfast item, as well as during the month of Ramadan for the Sehri meal.\n\nWhile most khichdi preparations use toor or moong dal, the Hyderabadi version uses masoor dal. Also, turmeric doesn’t feature in the ingredients list although some people use it in the modern preparations. The colouring of the dish comes from the caramelized onions that are an important flavour of the dish.\nAs opposed to the semi-liquid, moist preparation of khichdi elsewhere in the country, the dish made here has a drier texture, and each grain of rice stands out.\n\n### Talawa gosht\nTala huwa gosht, or talawa gosht (in Hyderabadi dialect) is a simple mutton or beef dish usually accompanied by khatti dal. It may be eaten with roti or rice.\n\n## Desserts\nQubani ka meetha (Khubani-ka-meetha) - Apricot pudding, topped with almond and cream. The original recipe is a translucent liquid.\nDouble ka meetha- Bread pudding topped with dry fruits, a derivative of the Mughlai dessert shahi tukre.\nSheer korma - Vermicelli pudding and celebratory dessert, specially made on the Ramzan (Eid Ul Fitr) day.\nFirni (Payasam) - A rice dessert.\nGil-e-firdaus - A variant of kheer made of bottle gourd. The name literally translates into \"the clay of paradise\".\nFaluda - A dessert made of shredded vermicelli noodles with rose syrup and milk.\nAab ka shola (aab shola) - Typical Hyderabadi summer sharbat.\nOsmania Biscuit is a popular biscuit, usually accompanied with tea.\nHyderabadi Irani tea available at Irani cafes.\nDum-ke-roat - a sweet confectionary made especially during the month of Muharram.\n\n## Breads\nNaan\nSheermal\n\n## Images\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nA Princely Legacy, Hyderabadi Cuisine By Pratibha Karan ISBN 81-7223-318-3, ISBN 978-81-7223-318-1 [1]\nElegant East Indian and Hyderabadi Cuisine By Asema Moosavi, Moosavi, Asema ISBN 0-9699523-0-9\nThe Essential Andhra Cookbook with Hyderabadi & Telengna Specialities by Bilkees I Latif\n101 Easy to Cook Hyderabadi Recipes By Devi, Geeta [2]\nFood of India By Priya Wickramasinghe, Carol Selva Rajah\nYou Are Where You Eat: Stories and Recipes from the Neighborhoods of New Orleans, By Elsa Hahne Page 47-50\nThe Jewels of Nizam: Recipes from the Khansamas of Hyderabad By Geeta Devi, 2014, ISBN 9788129124364\nAromas from a royal kitchen, 18 June 2019, The Deccan Herald\n\n## External links\n\nBiryani, Haleem & more on Hyderabad's menu: An article published by Times of India",

Though Asian cuisines have been mixed throughout history all over Asia, the most popular origin story of the fusion food resides with Chinese immigrants to British-ruled India at places like Calcutta.

Kolkata was the capital of British-ruled India when it was governed by the East India Trading Company (from 1757 to 1858). The city's relation to the British crown made it a great place for material prospects and opportunity, which drew businessmen and immigrant workers from surrounding areas. The city was the most accessible metropolitan area of the country by land from China; thus, it became home to the very first Chinese settler, a southern Chinese man named Tong Atchew (also referred to as Yang Dazhao or Yang Tai Chow). In 1778, Atchew settled 20 miles southwest of Kolkata, founding a sugar mill along with five dozen or so Chinese immigrants. Following Atchew's footsteps, waves of Cantonese immigrants from Guangdong province of China fled to India due to civil war, famine, poverty, and conflict, searching for safety and prosperity. Hakka Chinese found their niche as cobblers and tanners, while the Cantonese settled mostly as carpenters and the Hubei people as dentists. However, an occupation popular among all groups, especially of wives supporting their husbands' work, was a restaurateur.\nFrom these first early settlers, communities of Chinese influence sprung up throughout the area, neighbourhoods of immigrants cooking and eating foods from their homeland. These Canton cuisines, known in China to be light and fresh in flavour, began to adapt and evolve into the new area. One reason is due to the availability of ingredients and spices being different from those in Guangdong, therefore forcing the flavour to naturally Indianize; additionally, Chinese businesses began to cater their foods to the tastes of their Indian patrons to increase sales, utilizing more spices and heavier douses of sauce and oil than their traditional techniques required. Recognized as one of the first Indo-Chinese restaurants in the country, the still-standing corner eatery of Eau Chew gained its popularity by using the fashionable pull of exotic Chinese foods combined with non-threatening familiar flavours of chili, curry, and corn starch, to attract and keep-on customers. Kolkata today boasts the only Chinatown in the country, a neighbourhood known as the Tiretti Bazaar. This being said, nearly every city in India has these adapted \"Chinese\" foods, whether found in restaurants or hawked by roadside vendors, as the greasy, spicy, stir-fried food that has become wildly popular throughout the country. It is also important to note those Chinese returning from India to their homelands in China's south, for they often brought their new culinary practices and flavours with them, working to Indianize the taste of Cantonese-style foods in southern coastal cities such as Hong Kong.\n\n### Additional origin points\nAs Indian historian Pushpesh Pant once noted, Indian Chinese food is \"the result of several isolated encounters.\" These encounters, in addition to the Kolkata story, include influences of the Silk Road, historical ties, and geography. Each of these aspects has worked in some way to tie the culinary practices and flavours of the two countries together, marking other possible origin points for the Indian Chinese culinary tradition.\n\n## Features\nFoods tend to be flavoured with spices such as cumin, coriander seeds, and turmeric, which with a few regional exceptions, such as Xinjiang, are traditionally not associated with much of Chinese cuisine. Hot chilli, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, dry red chillis, black pepper corns and yoghurt are also frequently used in dishes. This makes Indian Chinese food similar in taste to many ethnic dishes in Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore and Malaysia, which have strong Chinese and Indian cultural influences.\nNon-staple dishes are by default served with generous helpings of gravy, although they can also be ordered \"dry\" or \"without gravy\". Culinary styles often seen in Indian Chinese fare include \"Chilli\" (implying batter-fried items cooked with pieces of chilli pepper), \"Manchurian\" (implying a sweet and salty brown sauce), and \"Schezwan\" (sic - see below) (implying a spicy red sauce).\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Appetizers\nChicken lollipop – Chicken hors d'œuvre\nHot and sour soup\nManchow soup – Vegetable/chicken soup\n\n### Main dishes\nThe main ingredient in all these dishes can often be substituted with other meats, vegetables or paneer. Usually the nomenclature is such that the main ingredient is mentioned first, followed by the entree style, for example \"Chilli Chicken\". Many are available in both \"dry\" or \"gravy\" versions, varying the amount of sauce served in the dish.\n\nChilli chicken, dry or gravy\nGarlic chicken\nChilli Paneer\nSchezwan - A spicy and pungent sauce made with dry red chillies, garlic, shallots and spices.  Dishes with this name in fact usually bear very little resemblance to ones from China's Sichuan Province, although they sometimes contain Sichuan peppercorns.\nGinger chicken\nManchurian, generally consisting of a variety of deep-fried meats, cauliflower (gobi) or paneer with vegetables in a spicy brown sauce. It is basically a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, and bears little resemblance to traditional Manchu cuisine or Chinese cuisine. It is said to have been invented in 1975 by Nelson Wang; Wang described his invention process as starting from the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chillis, but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself. A popular vegetarian variant replaces chicken with cauliflower, and is commonly known as gobi manchurian. Other vegetarian variants include mushroom, paneer, baby corn, veg Manchurian.\nChow mein - A popular dish combining noodles, vegetables, meat, scrambled egg, ginger and garlic, soy sauce, green chili sauce, red chili sauce and vinegar.\nHong Kong Chicken\nJalfrezi Chicken\nLemon chicken\nHunan chicken\nSweet and Sour Chicken - Different from the American Version of Sweet and Sour, but similar to General Tso's Chicken.\nChop suey American style & Chinese Style - Crispy Noodles with a variety of vegetables, chicken or meat and sauces.\n\n### Rice and noodles\nStaple base options for an Indian Chinese meal include chicken, shrimp or vegetable variants of \"Hakka\" or \"Schezwan\" noodles popularly referred to as chow mein; and regular or \"Schezwan\" fried rice. American chop suey and sweet and sour dishes can be found at many restaurants. Some South Indian restaurants have also come up with spring rolls and \"Schezwan\" dosas.\n\n### Sweets and desserts\nIndian Chinese dessert options include ice cream on honey-fried noodles or date pancakes.\n\n### Indian Chinese cuisine of Southeast Asia\nIn Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Singapore, many popular dishes carry influence from both Indian and Chinese cuisine due to cultural syncretism. Malaysian and Singaporean Chinese cuisine is primarily based on Fujian, Cantonese, Teochew, and Hakka cuisines, while their Indian cuisine is primarily based on South Indian cuisine, especially from Tamil, Telugu, and Malayali cuisine. Chinese and Indian cultures have also fused in Singapore and Malaysia, with Chinese and Indian relationships being the most common intercultural relationships in both countries. Singaporean and Malaysian dishes that carry influence from both Indian and Chinese cuisines include fish head curry and mee goreng, and popular Indian Chinese dishes such as Manchurian and chili chicken are also popular in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\n## Availability\nIndian or Kolkata-style Chinese food is readily available in major metropolitan areas of India. It is also available in a number of towns and at dhabas adjacent to highways. Many restaurants have a Chinese section in their menus, and some are even dedicated to serving Indian Chinese food. It can also be found in mobile kitchen carts, prepared in woks over a portable gas burner. Manchurian sauce, Schezwan sauce, soy sauce fresh and dry Hakka noodles are available in many stores in cities across the country.\nIn 2007, Chinese cuisine ranked as India's favourite cuisine after local food, growing at 9% annually. It is the most favoured option when young people go out to eat and the second favourite (after south Indian cuisine) when families dine out.\nMany Indian restaurants in the West and the Middle East also cater to the overseas Indians' nostalgic taste for Indian Chinese food. The cuisine is also branching out into the mainstream in major cities of North America. Chinese food in Nairobi, Kenya, also tends to be of this style. It is also available in Australia, especially in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. In many of these places, the restaurants are labelled as Hakka Chinese, when in fact the cuisine itself has very little resemblance to authentic Hakka cuisine. The \"Hakka\" label in these restaurants are usually referring to the owner's origins, and many Chinese restaurant owners in India were of Hakka origin.\n\n## See also\nAnglo-Indian cuisine\nFusion cuisine\nPakistani Chinese cuisine\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\nThe Hindu Business Line: The Chinese factor",

    "text": "# Indian Singaporean cuisine\n\nIndian Singaporean cuisine refers to food and beverages produced and consumed in Singapore that are derived, wholly or in part, from South Asian culinary traditions. The great variety of Singapore food includes Indian food, which tends to be Tamil cuisine and especially local Tamil Muslim cuisine, although North Indian food has become more visible recently. Indian dishes have become modified to different degrees, after years of contact with other Singapore cultures, and in response to locally available ingredients as well as changing local tastes.\n\n## History\nSee influence of Indian cuisine in Malaysia, due to Indianisation as part of Greater India as Malaysia and Southeast Asia have been historically influenced by the Indian culture, religion and cuisine.\n\n## Dishes\nThe local forms of Indian food may be seen as localised or even regional variations of Indian food, or in some cases, a form of hybrid Indian-Singaporean cuisine. Popular 'Indian' dishes and elements of Indian cuisine (although sometimes prepared and sold by non-Indians) include:\n\nSatti Sorru:Indian claypot rice\nPickle - Indian pickle of mixed vegetables. Now also served by Chinese and Malays with their traditional food.\nNasi biryani - Popular Indian dish of saffron rice and meat. It is sold by both Indians and Malays, and is essential at both Malay and Indian weddings.\nCurry - The basic Indian vegetable or meat gravy. It is now ubiquitous in local Chinese and Malay 'traditional' cuisine. A Peranakan example is Laksa, whose name derives from the Sanskrit for 'hundred thousand'. A Eurasian example is Devil's curry, while a Chinese example is Chilli crab.\nFish head curry - Iconic Singapore dish, invented by Indians (specifically one Mr. Marian Jacob Gomez, from Kerala) for the Chinese palate which values textures. In India, it is popular in toddy shops in Kerala.\nIndian Rojak - Salad of deep fried battered potatoes, eggs, seafood, tofu and other items. Served with a hot and sweet chilli sauce. The dish does not exist in India and is unique to Singapore and its region.\nIndian Mee goreng - Chinese yellow noodles, prepared 'Indian style' and fried with spices, minced meat, green peas and potatoes.\nMurtabak - Roti Prata stuffed with minced chicken, mutton, beef or sardines.\nRoti john - A split, panfried baguette topped with egg, minced mutton and onions, and served with ketchup.\nRoti Prata - 'Singapore's answer to the croissant'. A popular supper after leaving nightclubs. Variations include durian and cheese prata.\nTeh tarik - Literally 'pulled tea', named after its preparation technique. Compared to the cappuccino because of its frothy top.\nOther dishes were popular during the colonial period, when Indian ingredients and other culinary influences spread with the Empire to places like Singapore. Many of them endure in some homes and restaurants. Some of these dishes include:\n\nMince with potatoes and peas - a pork mince cooked with cloves and soya sauce. Similar to Goan quema and Indian kheema.\nChicken Wrap - An Anglo-Indian chicken wrap, derived from the wraps, prepared by pepperbox.sg.\nPanneer Wrap - A North-Indian Panneer wrap, derived from the wraps, prepared by pepperbox.sg.\nMulligatawny - An Anglo-Indian peppery curried soup, derived from the Tamil rasam.\nFish moolie - a spicy fish and coconut dish of possible Portuguese or Indian origin.\nCurry tiffin - Another Anglo-Indian tradition, with the name derived from an Indian term for lunch. Features a curry as a main dish with various side dishes.\nPork vindaloo - Derived from a Goan vinegared curry, which likely came to Malacca with the Portuguese in the 16th century. Now considered a Eurasian dish.\nSpiced mutton chops - Deep fried spicy mutton chops historically prepared by one Ujagar Singh at St Gregory Lane in Singapore.\nThere are also many other Indian foods that are less widely available foods, but which can still be found in several areas serving a more specifically Indian clientele, especially in and around Little India, Singapore. These include appam, bhatura, chutney, sambar, idli, muruku, putu mayam, samosa, tandoori, thosai, upma and various sweets, including jalebi, halva, laddu, paayasam and gulab jamun.\n\n## See also\nSingaporean cuisine\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Indian bread\n\nIndian breads are a wide variety of flatbreads and crêpes that are an integral part of Indian cuisine. Their variation reflects the diversity of Indian culture and food habits.\n\n## Ingredients\nMost flatbreads from northern India are unleavened and made primarily from milled flour, usually atta or maida, and water. Some flatbreads, especially paratha, may be stuffed with vegetables and layered with either ghee or butter.\nIn Maharashtra and Gujarat, breads are also made from grains like jowar (Sorghum bicolor), ragi (Eleusine coracana), rice and bajra (pearl millet), and are called \"rotla\" in Gujarat and \"bhakri\" in Maharashtra.\nMost Indian breads make use of the yeast spores in the atmosphere for fermentation.\n\n## Preparation\nIn northern India, a dough of the main ingredient is prepared and flattened by rolling. Most Indian breads, such as roti, kulcha and chapati, are baked on tava, a griddle made from cast iron, steel or aluminum. Others such as puri and bhatura are deep-fried. The dough for these breads is usually made with less water in order to reduce the oil soaked up when frying.\nIn Southern India, a batter of rice and black lentils is prepared and ladled in small amounts onto a hot greased skillet, where it is spread out into a thin circle and fried with oil or ghee until golden brown.\nIn Western India (including the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan) bread may be made from coarse grains such as bajra, sorghum or ragi, though wheat is the staple in these regions. The grains or cereals are usually milled into a fine powder, and mixed with a little water to make a smooth dough. This dough is patted into a circle by hand, either by holding it between the two hands or by placing it on an upturned plate or other flat surface.\nIn Maharashtra, a multi-grain flatbread called \"thalipeeth\" is also prepared. It contains many grains and cereals like wheat, rice, bajra, jowar, ragi, horse gram, green gram, black gram, chickpeas and so on. Each grain or cereal is roasted separately and then milled together into a fine powder. Spices and chopped onions are added along with water to make the dough, and it is patted into circles, after which it is roasted on a griddle with some ghee or oil. It is often served with homemade butter.\nIndian breads of Central Asian origin, such as naan and tandoori roti, are baked in a tandoor.

Later, trade with British and Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine.\n\n### Prehistory and Indus Valley Civilisation\nSee also: Meluhha, Indus–Mesopotamia relations, and Indian maritime history\nAfter 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between Fertile Crescent and Indus Valley civilisations seems to have occurred as a consequence of the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture. Wheat and barley were first grown around 7000 BCE, when agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus Valley. Sesame and humped cattle were domesticated in the local farming communities. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in South Asia.\nBy 3000 BCE, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in India.\nFrom around 2350 BCE evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur in Mesopotamia has been found, as well as Clove heads thought to originate from the Moluccas in Maritime Southeast Asia, which were found in a 2nd millennium BC site in Terqa. Akkadian Empire records mention timber, carnelian and ivory as being imported from Meluhha by Meluhhan ships, Meluhha being generally considered as the Mesopotamian name for the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\n### Vedic age\nThe ancient Hindu text Mahabharata mentions rice and vegetable cooked together, and the word \"pulao\" or \"pallao\" is used to refer to the dish in ancient Sanskrit works, such as Yājñavalkya Smṛti. Ayurveda, ancient Indian system of wellness, deals with holistic approach to the wellness, and it includes food, dhyana (meditation) and yoga.\n\n### Antiquity\nEarly diet in India mainly consisted of legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy products, and honey. Staple foods eaten today include a variety of lentils (dal), whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), rice, and pearl millet (bājra), which has been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent since 6200 BCE. The Sangam literature, which is specific to South India, mentions that fish, crab, forest cattle, pork, monitor lizard, and poultry were consumed in the region together with a variety of millets, sago, sugarcane, dairy products, honey, and rice.\nOver time, segments of the population embraced vegetarianism during the Śramaṇa movement while an equitable climate permitted a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains to be grown throughout the year.\nA food classification system that categorised any item as saatvic, raajsic, or taamsic developed in Yoga tradition. The Bhagavad Gita proscribes certain dietary practices (chapter 17, verses 8–10).\nConsumption of beef is taboo, due to cows being considered sacred in Hinduism. Beef is generally not eaten by Hindus in India except for Kerala, parts of southern Tamil Nadu and the north-east.\n\n### Ingredients mentioned in ancient Indian scripture\nWhile many ancient Indian recipes have been lost in history, one can look at ancient texts to see what was eaten in ancient and pre-historic India.\n\nBarley—(known as Yava in both Vedic and Classical Sanskrit) is mentioned many times in Rigveda and other Indian scriptures as one of the principal grains in ancient India\nBetel leaf—primary use is as a wrapper for the chewing of areca nut or tobacco, where it is mainly used to add flavour; may also be used in cooking, usually raw, for its peppery taste\nBreadfruit—fritters called jeev kadge phodi in Konkani or kadachakka varuthath in Malayalam are a local delicacy in coastal Karnataka and Kerala\nChickpeas—popular dishes are made with chickpea flour, such as mirchi bajji and mirapakaya bajji\nCurd—a traditional yogurt or fermented milk product, originating from the Indian subcontinent, usually prepared from cow's milk, and sometimes buffalo milk, or goat milk*Figs—cultivated from Afghanistan to Portugal, also grown in Pithoragarh in the Kumaon hills of India; from the 15th century onwards, also grown in areas including Northern Europe and the New World\nGhee—a class of clarified butter that originated in ancient India, commonly used in the Indian subcontinent, Middle-Eastern cuisine, traditional medicine, and religious rituals*Grape wine—first-known mention of grape-based wines in India is from the late 4th-century BC writings of Chanakya\nHoney—the spiritual and supposed therapeutic use of honey in ancient India was documented in both the Vedas and the Ayurveda texts*Mango—the Jain goddess Ambika is traditionally represented as sitting under a mango tree\nMustard—brown mustard is a spice that was cultivated in the Indus Valley civilisation and is one of the important spices used in the Indian subcontinent today\nPomegranate—in some Hindu traditions, the pomegranate (Hindi: anār) symbolises prosperity and fertility, and is associated with both Bhoomidevi (the earth goddess) and Lord Ganesha (the one fond of the many-seeded fruit)\nRice—cultivated in the Indian subcontinent from as early as 5,000 BC\nRice cake—quite a variety are available*Rose apple—mainly eaten as a fruit and also used to make pickles (chambakka achar)\nSaffron—almost all saffron grows in a belt from Spain in the west to Kashmir in the east\nSalt—considered to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings; in Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion, and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried\nSesame oil—popular in Asia, especially in Korea, China, and the South Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where its widespread use is similar to that of olive oil in the Mediterranean*Sorghum—commonly called jwaarie, jowar, jola, or jondhalaa, sorghum is one of the staple sources of nutrition\nSugar—produced in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, its cultivation spread from there into modern-day Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass\nSugarcane—the earliest known production of crystalline sugar began in northern India; the earliest evidence of sugar production comes from ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts\nTurmeric—used widely as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking\n\n### Middle Ages to the 16th century\nDuring the Middle Ages, several Indian dynasties were predominant, including the Gupta dynasty. Travel to India during this time introduced new cooking methods and products to the region, including tea.\nIndia was later invaded by tribes from Central Asian cultures, which led to the emergence of Mughlai cuisine, a mix of Indian and Central Asian cuisine. Hallmarks include seasonings such as saffron.\n\n### Colonial Period\nThe Portuguese and British during their rule introduced cooking techniques such as baking, and foods from the New World and Europe. The new-world vegetables popular in cuisine from the Indian subcontinent include maize, tomato, potato, sweet potatoes, peanuts, squash, and chilli. Most New World vegetables such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, Amaranth, peanuts and cassava based Sago are allowed on Hindu fasting days. Cauliflower was introduced by the British in 1822. In the late 18th/early 19th century, an autobiography of a Scottish Robert Lindsay mentions a Sylheti man called Saeed Ullah cooking a curry for Lindsay's family. This is possibly the oldest record of Indian cuisine in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Ingredients\nStaple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), tuer (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and moong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively. Some pulses, such as channa or cholae (chickpeas), rajma (kidney beans), and lobiya (black-eyed peas) are very common, especially in the northern regions. Channa and moong are also processed into flour (besan).\nMany Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India, and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala and parts of southern Tamil Nadu. Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma.\nIn recent decades, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India. Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium. Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used commonly.\nMany types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton tend to be the most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.\n\nThe most important and frequently used spices and flavourings in Indian cuisine are whole or powdered chilli pepper (mirch, introduced by the Portuguese from Mexico in the 16th century), black mustard seed (sarso), cardamom (elaichi), cumin (jeera), turmeric (haldi), asafoetida (hing), ginger (adrak), coriander (dhania), and garlic (lasoon).\nOne popular spice mix is garam masala, a powder that typically includes seven dried spices in a particular ratio, including black cardamom, cinnamon (dalchini), clove (laung), cumin (jeera), black peppercorns, coriander seeds and anise star.. Each culinary region has a distinctive garam masala blend—individual chefs may also have their own.\nThe spices chosen for a dish are freshly ground and then fried in hot oil or ghee to create a paste. The process is called bhuna, the name also being used for a type of curry.\nThere are other spice blends which are popular in various regions.  Panch phoron is a spice blend which is popular in eastern India.  Goda masala is a sweet spice mix which is popular in Maharashtra. Some leaves commonly used for flavouring include bay leaves (tejpat), coriander leaves, fenugreek (methi) leaves, and mint leaves. The use of curry leaves and roots for flavouring is typical of Gujarati and South Indian cuisine. Sweet dishes are often seasoned with cardamom, saffron, nutmeg, and rose petal essences.\n\n## Regional cuisines\nCuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits and vegetables are ripe.\n\n### Andaman and Nicobar Islands\nSeafood plays a major role in the cuisine of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Staples of the diet of the Indigenous Andamanese traditionally include roots, honey, fruits, meat, and fish, obtained by hunting and gathering. Some insects were also eaten as delicacies. Immigration from mainland of India, however, has resulted in variations in the cuisine.\n\n### Andhra Pradesh\nThe cuisine of Andhra Pradesh belongs to the two Telugu-speaking regions of Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra and is part of Telugu cuisine. The food of Andhra Pradesh is known for its heavy use of spices, and the use of tamarind.\nSeafood is common in the coastal region of the state. Rice is the staple food (as is with all South Indian states) eaten with lentil preparations such as pappu (lentils) and pulusu (stew) and spicy vegetables or curries.\nIn Andhra, leafy greens or vegetables such as bottle-gourd and eggplant are usually added to dal. Pickles are an essential part of the local cuisine; popular among those are mango-based pickles such as avakaya and maagaya, gongura (a pickle made from sorrel leaves), usirikaya (gooseberry or amla), nimmakaya (lime), and tomato pickle.\nPerugu (yogurt) is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness.

Over time, various cuisines have blended with indigenous dishes, while foreign ones have been adapted to local tastes. Significant Arab, Syrian, Portuguese, Dutch, Jewish, and Middle Eastern influences exist in this region's cuisine.\n\nCoconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring. Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the state, making seafood a common part of the meal.

Dhindo, daal bhat, gundruk, momo, gya thuk, ningro, phagshapa, and sel roti are some of the local dishes.\nAlcoholic drinks are consumed by both men and women. Beef is eaten by Bhutias.\n\n### Sindh\nSindhi cuisine refers to the native cuisine of the Sindhi people from the Sindh region, now in Pakistan. While Sindh is not geographically a part of modern India, its culinary traditions persist, due to the sizeable number of Hindu Sindhis who migrated to India following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, especially in Sindhi enclaves such as Ulhasnagar and Gandhidam.\nA typical meal in many Sindhi households includes wheat-based flatbread (phulka) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one with gravy and one dry. Lotus stem (known as kamal kakri) is also used in Sindhi dishes. Cooking vegetables by deep frying is common.\nSome regular Sindhi dishes are sindhi kadhi, sai bhaji, koki and besan bhaji. Ingredients frequently used are mango powder, tamarind, kokum flowers, and dried pomegranate seeds.\n\n### Tamil Nadu\nTamil Nadu is noted for its deep belief that serving food to others is a service to humanity, as is common in many regions of India. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes.\nTamil food is characterised by its use of rice, legumes, and lentils, along with distinct aromas and flavours achieved by the blending of spices such as mustard, curry leaves, tamarind, coriander, ginger, garlic, chilli pepper, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rose water.\nThe traditional way of eating involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a plantain leaf, and using the right hand to eat. After the meal the plantain leaf is discarded but becomes food for free-ranging cattle and goats.\nA meal (called saapadu) consists of rice with other typical Tamil dishes on a plantain leaf. A typical Tamilian would eat on a plantain leaf as it is believed to give a different flavour and taste to food. Also growing in popularity are stainless-steel trays, plates with a selection of different dishes in small bowls.\nTamil food is characterised by tiffin, which is a light food taken for breakfast or dinner, and meals which are usually taken during lunch. The word \"curry\" is derived from the Tamil kari, meaning something similar to \"sauce\".\nSouthern regions such as Tirunelveli, Madurai, Paramakudi, Karaikudi, Chettinad and Kongu Nadu are noted for their spicy non-vegetarian dishes. Dosa, idli, pongal and biryani are some of the popular dishes that are eaten with chutney and sambar. Fish and other seafoods are also very popular, because the state is located on the coast. Chicken and goat meat are the predominantly consumed meats in Tamil Nadu.\nA typical Tamil vegetarian meal is heavily dependent on rice, vegetables and lentil preparations such as rasam and sambar, but there are variations. They have influenced Kerala as well in their kootu, arachi vitta sambhar and molagootals (mulligatawny soup).\nAs mentioned above, the Chettinad variety of food uses many strong spices, such as pepper, garlic, fennel seeds and onions. Tamil food tends to be spicy compared to other parts of India so there is a tradition of finishing the meal with dahi (yogurt) is considered a soothing end to the meal.\nNotably, Tamil Brahmin cuisine, the food of the Iyers and Iyengar community, is characterised by slightly different meal times and meal structures compared to other communities within the state.\nHistorically vegetarian, the cuisine is known for its milder flavour and avoidance of onion and garlic (although this practice appears to be disappearing with time).\nAfter a light morning meal of filter coffee and different varieties of porridges (oatmeal and janata kanji are immensely popular), the main meal of the day, lunch/brunch is usually at 11 am and typically follows a two-three course meal structure. Steamed rice is the main dish, and is always accompanied by a seasonally steamed/sauteed vegetable (poriyal), and two or three types of tamarind stews, the most popular being sambhar and rasam. The meal typically ends with thair sadham (rice with yogurt), usually served with pickled mangoes or lemons.\nTiffin is the second meal of the day and features several breakfast favourites such as idli, rava idli, upma, dosa varieties, and vada, and is usually accompanied by chai.\nDinner is the simplest meal of the day, typically involving leftovers from either lunch or tiffin. Fresh seasonal fruit consumed in the state include bananas, papaya, honeydew and cantaloupe melons, jackfruit, mangos, apples, kasturi oranges, pomegranates, and nongu (hearts of palm).\n\n### Telangana\nThe cuisine of Telangana consists of the Telugu cuisine, of Telangana's Telugu people as well as Hyderabadi cuisine (also known as Nizami cuisine), of Telangana's Hyderabadi Muslim community.\nHyderabadi food is based heavily on non-vegetarian ingredients, while Telugu food is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients. Telugu food is rich in spices and chillies are abundantly used. The food also generally tends to be more on the tangy side with tamarind and lime juice both used liberally as souring agents.\nRice is the staple food of Telugu people. Starch is consumed with a variety of curries and lentil soups or broths. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are both popular.\nHyderabadi cuisine includes popular delicacies such as biryani, haleem, Baghara baingan and kheema, while Hyderabadi day-to-day dishes see some similarities to Telanganite Telugu food, with its use of tamarind, rice, and lentils, along with meat. Dahi (yogurt) is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness.\n\n### Tripura\nThe Tripuri people are the original inhabitants of the state of Tripura in northeast India. Today, they comprise the communities of Tipra, Reang, Jamatia, Noatia, and Uchoi, among others. The Tripuri are non-vegetarian, although they have a minority of Vaishnavite vegetarians.\nThe major ingredients of Tripuri cuisine include vegetables, herbs, pork, chicken, mutton, fishes, turtle, shrimps, crabs, freshwater mussels, periwinkles, edible freshwater snails and frogs.\n\n### Uttar Pradesh\nTraditionally, Uttar Pradeshi cuisine consists of Awadhi, Bhojpuri, and Mughlai cuisine, though a vast majority of the state is vegetarian, preferring dal, roti, sabzi, and rice. Pooris and kachoris are eaten on special occasions.\nChaat, samosa, and pakora, among the most popular snacks in India, originate from Uttar Pradesh.\nWell-known dishes include kebabs, dum biryani, and various mutton recipes. Sheer qorma, ghevar, gulab jamun, kheer, and ras malai are some of the popular desserts in this region.\nAwadhi cuisine (Hindi: अवधी खाना) is from the city of Lucknow, which is the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh in Central-South Asia and North India, and the cooking patterns of the city are similar to those of Central Asia, the Middle East, and other parts of North India. The cuisine consists of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.\nAwadh has been greatly influenced by Mughal cooking techniques, and the cuisine of Lucknow bears similarities to those of Central Asia, Kashmir, Punjab and Hyderabad. The city is also known for its Nawabi foods. The bawarchis and rakabdars of Awadh gave birth to the dum style of cooking or the art of cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today. Their spread consisted of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and warqi parathas.\nThe richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices, including cardamom and saffron.\nMughlai cuisine is a style of cooking developed in the Indian subcontinent by the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire. It represents the cooking styles used in North India (especially Uttar Pradesh).\nThe cuisine is strongly influenced by Central Asian cuisine, the region where the Chagatai-Turkic Mughal rulers originally hailed from, and has strongly influenced the regional cuisines of Kashmir and the Punjab region.\nThe tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and is often associated with a distinctive aroma and the taste of ground and whole spices.\nA Mughlai course is an elaborate buffet of main course dishes with a variety of accompaniments.\n\n### Uttarakhand\nFood from Uttrakhand is known to be healthy and wholesome to suit the high-energy necessities of the cold, mountainous region. It is a high-protein diet that makes heavy use of pulses and vegetables. Traditionally, it is cooked over wood or charcoal fire mostly using iron utensils.\nWhile making use of condiments such as jeera, haldi and rai common in other Indian cuisines, Uttarakhand cuisine also use exotic ingredients such as jambu, timmer, ghandhraini and bhangira.\nAlthough the people in Uttarakhand also make dishes common in other parts of northern India, several preparations are unique to Uttarakhand such as rus, chudkani, dubuk, chadanji, jholi, kapa, and more.\nAmong dressed salads and sauces, kheere ka raita, nimbu mooli ka raita, daarim ki khatai and aam ka fajitha are also popular.\nThe cuisine mainly consists of food from two different sub-regions, Garhwal and Kumaon, though their basic ingredients are the same. Both Kumaoni and Garhwali styles make liberal use of ghee, lentils or pulses, vegetables and bhaat (rice). They also use badi (sun-dried urad dal balls) and mungodi (sun-dried moong dal balls) as substitutes for vegetables at times.\nDuring festivals and other celebrations, the people of Uttarakhand prepare special refreshments which include both salty preparations such as bada and sweet preparations such as pua and singal. Uttarakhand also has several sweets (mithai) such as singodi, bal-mithai, and malai laddu, native to its traditions.\n\n## Gallery\nNorth India\n\nWest India\n\nEast India\n\nSouth India\n\n## Hindu fasting cuisine\nHindu people fast on days such as Ekadashi, in honour of Lord Vishnu or his Avatars, Chaturthi in honour of Ganesh, Mondays in honour of Shiva, or Saturdays in honour of Hanuman or Saturn.\nOnly certain kinds of foods are allowed to be eaten. These include milk and other dairy products (such as dahi), fruit, and Western food items such as sago, potatoes, purple-red sweet potatoes, amaranth seeds, nuts and (shama millet).\nPopular fasting dishes include farari chevdo, sabudana khichadi, and peanut soup.\n\n## Diaspora and fusion cuisines\nThe interaction of various Indian diaspora communities with the native cultures in their new homes has resulted in the creation of many fusion cuisines, which blend aspects of Indian and other international cuisines. These cuisines tend to interpolate Indian seasoning and cooking techniques into their own national dishes.\n\n### Indian Chinese cuisine\nIndian Chinese cuisine, also known as Indo-Chinese cuisine originated in the 19th century among the Chinese community of Calcutta, during the immigration of Hakka Chinese from Canton (present-day Guangzhou) seeking to escape the First and Second Opium Wars and political instability in the region. Upon exposure to local Indian cuisine, they incorporated many spices and cooking techniques into their own cuisine, thus creating a unique fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisine.\nAfter 1947, many Cantonese immigrants opened restaurants in Calcutta, serving dishes that combined aspects of Indian cuisine with Cantonese cuisine. In other parts of India, Indian Chinese cuisine is derived from Calcutta-Chinese cuisine, but bears little resemblance to their Chinese counterparts as the dishes tend to be flavoured with cumin, coriander seeds, and turmeric, which with a few regional exceptions, are not traditionally associated with Chinese cuisine. Chilli, ginger, garlic and dahi (yogurt) are also frequently used in dishes.\nPopular dishes include Chicken Manchurian, chicken lollipop, chilli chicken, Hakka noodles, Hunan chicken, chow mein, and Szechwan fried rice.\nSoups such as Manchow soup and sweet corn soup are popular, whereas desserts include ice cream on honey-fried noodles and date pancakes.\n\n### Indian Thai cuisine\nThai cuisine was influenced by Indian cuisine, like as recorded by the Thai monk Buddhadasa Bhikku in his writing 'India's Benevolence to Thailand'. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use spices in their food in various ways from Indians. Thais also obtained the methods of making herbal medicines (Ayurveda) from the Indians. Some plants like sarabhi of family Guttiferae, kanika or harsinghar, phikun or Mimusops elengi and bunnak or the rose chestnut etc. were brought from India.\n\n### Malaysian Indian cuisine\nMalaysian Indian cuisine, or the cooking of the ethnic Indian communities in Malaysia consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Malaysia.\nA typical Malaysian Indian dish is likely to be redolent with curry leaves, whole and powdered spice, and contains fresh coconut in various forms.\nGhee is still widely used for cooking, although vegetable oils and refined palm oils are now commonplace in home kitchens.\n\n### Indian Singaporean cuisine\nIndian Singaporean cuisine refers to foods and beverages produced and consumed in Singapore that are derived, wholly or in part, from South Asian culinary traditions.\nThe great variety of Singaporean food includes Indian food, which tends to be Tamil cuisine, especially local Tamil Muslim cuisine, although North Indian food has become more visible recently.\nIndian dishes have become modified to different degrees, after years of contact with other Singaporean cultures, and in response to locally available ingredients, as well as changing local tastes.\n\n### Indian Indonesian cuisine\nIndian-Indonesian cuisine refers to food and beverages in Indonesian cuisine that have influenced Indian cuisine—especially from Tamil, Punjabi, and Gujarati cuisine. These dishes are well integrated, such as appam, biryani, murtabak and curry.\n\n### Indian Filipino cuisine\nFilipino cuisine, found throughout the Philippines archipelago, has been historically influenced by the Indian cuisine. Indian influences can also be noted in rice-based delicacies such as bibingka (analogous to the Indonesian bingka), puto, and puto bumbong, where the latter two are plausibly derived from the south Indian puttu, which also has variants throughout Maritime Southeast Asia (e.g. kue putu, putu mangkok).\nThe kare-kare, more popular in Luzon, on the other hand could trace its origins from the Seven Years' War when the British occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764 with a force that included Indian sepoys, who had to improvise Indian dishes given the lack of spices in the Philippines to make curry. This is said to explain the name and its supposed thick, yellow-to-orange annatto and peanut-based sauce, which alludes to a type of curry.\nAtchara of Philippines originated from the Indian achar, which was transmitted to the Philippines via the acar of the Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei.\n\n### Anglo-Indian cuisine\nAnglo-Indian cuisine developed during the period of British colonial rule in India, as British officials interacted with their Indian cooks.\nWell-known Anglo-Indian dishes include chutneys, salted beef tongue, kedgeree, ball curry, fish rissoles, and mulligatawny soup.\n\n## Desserts\nMany Indian desserts, or mithai, are fried foods made with sugar, milk or condensed milk. Ingredients and preferred types of dessert vary by region. In the eastern part of India, for example, most are based on milk products.\nMany are flavoured with almonds and pistachios, spiced with cardamon, nutmeg, cloves and black pepper, and decorated with nuts, or with gold or silver leaf. Popular Indian desserts include rasogolla, gulab jamun, jalebi, laddu, and peda.\n\n## Beverages\n\n\n### Non-alcoholic beverages\nTea is a staple beverage throughout India, since the country is one of the largest producers of tea in the world. The most popular varieties of tea grown in India include Assam tea, Darjeeling tea and Nilgiri tea. It is prepared by boiling the tea leaves in a mix of water, milk, and spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. In India, tea is often enjoyed with snacks like biscuits and pakoda.\nCoffee is another popular beverage, but more popular in South India. Coffee is also cultivated in some parts of India. There are two varieties of coffee popular in India, which include Indian filter coffee and instant coffee.\nLassi is a traditional dahi (yogurt)-based drink in India. It is made by blending yogurt with water or milk and spices. Salted lassi is more common in villages of Punjab and in Porbandar, Gujarat. Traditional lassi is sometimes flavoured with ground roasted cumin. Lassi can also be flavoured with ingredients such as sugar, rose water, mango, lemon, strawberry, and saffron.\nSharbat is a sweet cold beverage prepared from fruits or flower petals. It can be served in concentrate form and eaten with a spoon, or diluted with water to create a drink. Popular sharbats are made from plants such as rose, sandalwood, bel, gurhal (hibiscus), lemon, orange, pineapple, sarasaparilla and kokum, falsa (Grewia asiatica). In Ayurveda, sharbats are believed to hold medicinal value.\nThandai is a cold drink prepared with a mixture of almonds, fennel seeds, watermelon kernels, rose petals, pepper, poppy seeds, cardamom, saffron, milk and sugar. It is native to India and is often associated with the Maha Shivaratri and Holi or Holla mahalla festival. Sometimes bhaang (cannabis) is added to prepare special thandai.\nOther beverages include nimbu pani (lemonade), chaas, badam doodh  (milk with nuts – mostly almonds – and cardamom), Aam panna, kokum sharbat, and coconut water.\nModern carbonated cold drinks unique to southern India include beverages, such as panner soda or goli soda, a mixture of carbonated water, rose water, rose milk, and sugar, naranga soda, a mixture of carbonated water, salt and lemon juice, and nannari sarbath, a mixture with sarasaparilla.\n\nSharbats with carbonated water are the most popular non-alcoholic beverages in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Street shops in Central Kerala and Madurai region of Tamil Nadu are well known for these drinks which are also called kulukki sarbaths in Kerala.\n\n### Alcoholic beverages\n\n\n## Eating habits\nIndians consider a healthy breakfast important. They generally prefer to drink tea or coffee with breakfast, though food preferences vary regionally. North Indian people prefer roti, parathas, and a vegetable dish accompanied by achar (a pickle) and some curd. Various types of packaged pickles are available in the market. One of the oldest pickle-making companies in India is Harnarains, which started in the 1860s in Old Delhi.\nPeople of Gujarat prefer dhokla and milk, while south Indians prefer idli and dosa, generally accompanied by sambhar or sagu and various chutneys.\nTraditional lunch in India usually consists of a main dish of rice in the south and the east, and whole-wheat rotis in the north. It typically includes two or three kinds of vegetables, and sometimes items such as kulcha, naan, or parathas. Paan (stuffed, spiced and folded betel leaves) which aids digestion is often eaten after lunch and dinner in many parts of India.\nIndian families often gather for \"evening snack time\", similar to tea time to talk and have tea and snacks.\nDinner is considered the main meal of the day. Also, many households, especially in north and central India, prefer having sweets after the dinner (similar to the Western concept of dessert after meals).\n\n## Dietary practices\nIn India people often follow dietary practices based on their religious beliefs,\n\nMany Hindu communities consider beef taboo since they believed that Hindu scriptures condemn cow slaughter. Cow slaughter has been banned in many states of India, with the exceptions of the North-Eastern states, West Bengal and Kerala. However, buffalo meat is available in some of these states to be consumed by other religious communities.\nThe taboo on beef is defied by the marginalised Hindu castes in the Dalit fold, substantially covered in their literature and often displayed at their food festivals. As Dalit communities were restricted to living outside the village in mostly barren lands, with reduced resources to cultivate their food, discarded cows were essential traditional food that nourished them. Dalit cuisine included dishes made with coagulated beef blood, preserved meat, and intestines. During the independence era, and after, the imposition of beef restrictions on Dalit communities was part of efforts to bring them under a unified nationalist identity.\nVaishnavism followers generally are strict lacto-vegetarians due to an emphasis on Ahimsa. They also do not consume garlic and onions.\nJains follow a strict form of lacto-vegetarianism, known as Jain vegetarianism, which in addition to being completely lacto-vegetarian, also excludes all root vegetables such as carrots and potatoes because when the root is pulled up, organisms that live around the root also die.\nMuslims do not eat pork or pork products. They consume buffalo and beef products.\nIn certain North-Eastern regions, canines are part of culinary heritage. While only some communities eat dog meat, it is presently neither universal nor widely consumed. Nevertheless, it has been a constant source of stereotype and racial discrimination against people from the region.\nIn India dietary practices are also closely related to caste discrimination practices as they are rooted in notions of pollution and filth. Dalit and tribal accounts on cooking and eating narrate casteist-racist treatment accorded to Dalit and tribal culinary practices. This sometimes attract policing on the grounds of creating public nuisance by raising civic concerns. Brahmanical food practices dictate which food is clean and unclean based on their sensorial experiences.\n\n## Etiquette\nTraditionally, meals in India are eaten while seated either on the floor, or on very low stools or mattress. Food is most often eaten with the hands rather than cutlery.\nOften roti is used to scoop curry without allowing it to touch the hand. In the wheat-producing north, a piece of roti is gripped with the thumb and middle finger and ripped off while holding the roti down with the index finger.\nA somewhat different method is used in the south for dosai, adai, and uththappam, where the middle finger is pressed down to hold the bread and the forefinger and thumb used to grip and separate a small part. Traditional serving styles vary regionally throughout India.\nContact with other cultures has affected Indian dining etiquette. For example, the Anglo-Indian middle class commonly uses spoons and forks, as is traditional in Western culture.\nIn South India, cleaned banana leaves, which can be disposed of after meals, are used for serving food. When hot food is served on banana leaves, the leaves add distinctive aromas and taste to the food. Leaf plates are less common today, except on special occasions.\n\n## Outside India\nIndian migration has spread the culinary traditions of the subcontinent throughout the world. These cuisines have been adapted to local tastes, and have also affected local cuisines. The international appeal of curry has been compared to that of pizza. Indian tandoor dishes such as chicken tikka also enjoy widespread popularity.\n\n### Australia\nA Roy Morgan Research survey taken between 2013 and 2018 found that Indian cuisine was the top-rated international food among 51% of Australians, behind Chinese, Italian, and Thai.\n\n### Canada\nAs in the United Kingdom and the United States, Indian cuisine is widely available in Canada, especially in the cities of Toronto, Vancouver, and Ottawa where the majority of Canadians of South Asian heritage live.\n\n### China\nIndian food is gaining popularity in China, where there are many Indian restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Hong Kong alone has more than 50 Indian restaurants, some of which date back to the 1980s. Most of the Indian restaurants in Hong Kong are in Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\n### Fiji\nIndo-Fijians have a similar cuisine, often with Fijian influence.\n\n### Middle East\nThe Indian culinary scene in the Middle East has been influenced greatly by the large Indian diaspora in these countries. Centuries of trade relations and cultural exchange resulted in a significant influence on each region's cuisines. The use of the tandoor, which originated in northwestern India, is an example.\nThe large influx of Indian expatriates into Middle Eastern countries during the 1970s and 1980s led to a boom in Indian restaurants to cater to this population and was also widely influenced by the local and international cuisines.\n\n### Nepal\nIndian cuisine is available in the streets of Nepalese cities, including Kathmandu and Janakpur.\n\n### Southeast Asia\nOther cuisines which borrow inspiration from Indian cooking styles include Cambodian, Lao, Filipino, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, and Burmese cuisines. The spread of vegetarianism in other parts of Asia is often credited to Hindu and Buddhist practices.\nIndian cuisine is very popular in Southeast Asia, due to the strong Hindu and Buddhist cultural influence in the region. Indian cuisine has had considerable influence on Malaysian cooking styles and also enjoys popularity in Singapore. There are numerous North and South Indian restaurants in Singapore, mostly in Little India.\nSingapore is also known for fusion cuisine combining traditional Singaporean cuisine with Indian influences. Fish head curry, for example, is a local creation. Indian influence on Malay cuisine dates to the 19th century.\n\n### United Kingdom\nThe UK's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostanee Coffee House, opened in 1810. By 2003, there were as many as 10,000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in England and Wales alone. According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom is worth 3.2 billion pounds, accounts for two-thirds of all eating out in the country, and serves about 2.5 million customers every week.\nOne of the best known examples of British Indian restaurant cuisine is chicken tikka masala, which has also been called \"a true British national dish.\"\n\n### Ireland\nIreland's first Indian restaurant, the Indian Restaurant and Tea Rooms, opened in 1908 on Sackville Street, now O'Connell Street, in Dublin. Today, Indian restaurants are commonplace in most Irish cities and towns. Non-Chinese Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group in Ireland.\n\n### United States\nA survey by The Washington Post in 2007 stated that more than 1,200 Indian food products had been introduced into the United States since 2000. There are numerous Indian restaurants across the US, which vary based on regional culture and climate. North Indian and South Indian cuisines are especially well represented. Most Indian restaurants in the United States serve Americanised versions of North Indian food, which is generally less spicy than its Indian equivalents.\nAt sit-down restaurants with North Indian cuisine (the most common), complimentary papadum is served with three dipping sauces—typically hari chutney (mint and cilantro), imli chutney (taramind), and a spicy red chilli or onion chutney—in place of European-style bread before the meal.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n\n== External links ==",

The curries and breads vary depending on the region and local preferences. The higher priced ones may add a sweet to the combination. Refills are generally not offered.\n\n## Styles\nIt is common to serve different cuisines at different counters within the same premises. Presence of a large vegetarian population, who eschew non-vegetarian food, has given rise to outlets which exclusively serve vegetarian fast food. Also, different variety of food may be served depending on the times of the day. Beverages such coffee, tea, soft drinks and fruit juices may also be served in such outlets. Some outlets may additionally have specially designed counters for ice-cream, chaats etc.\nPopular formats of fast food business in India have the following features in common:\n\nWide opening on the roadside\nEasy to maintain and durable décor\nA cash counter where food coupons are sold\nA food delivery counter which invariably is granite topped\nAdditional counters for Ice Creams, Chaats, Beverages etc.\nA well fitted kitchen located so as to be visible to the customers\nTall tables, typically of stainless steel, where one can eat while standing\nA drinking water fountain adorned with a water filter\nRust-proof and non-breakable crockery\nMost of the fast food outlets in India are stand alone establishment, few of them having more than one branch.\n\n## Food courts\nAnother concept of fast food that is becoming popular is that of Food Courts. Here also one has to purchase coupons and collect the food from one of the several counters. Each one of these counters serves specific variety of food and may be owned by different individuals or caterers. Food Courts are normally located on much bigger premises and may provide seating facility in addition to the stand and eat arrangement. Typically one entrepreneur owns or takes on lease the entire premises and promotes the place under one name. They then let out individual counters to different independent operators to offer different menu. Internal competition is avoided by not allowing more than one counter to offer similar food.\nSeveral international fast-food chains like Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's, and Taco Bell have their outlets in major cities. Some Indian chains with outlets across India include Barista Coffee and Café Coffee Day.\nNow local chains coupled with numerous foreign fast foods have appeared in India.\n\n## Varieties of food offered\nSome of the popular dishes offered at Indian fast food outlets are:\n\n### Western Indian\nVada pav – a deep-fried potato (vada) sandwiched in a bread bun (pav)\nMisal pav – cooked sprouted lentils and farsan in a spicy gravy\nPav bhaji – a thick vegetable curry (bhaji) served with a soft bread roll (pav)\nKhaman –  a Gujarati snack that is made from fresh daal or gram flour\nSamosa – a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, and peas\nUsal – a Maharastrian dish made of legumes such as peas, lentils, black-eyed beans, Matki, Moong, or Hyacinth beans\nKhandvi\nGathiya – Bhavanagar gathiya, Gathiya\nJalebi – Kesar jalebi, Desi ghee jalebi\nPoha – Masa Poha, Kanda poha, Usal poha\nPuff – Masala Puff, Cheese Puff\nShahi tukda – A bread pudding sweet\n\n### South Indian\nIdli – Rice Idli, Rava Idli\nVada – Uddina Vada, Rava Vada, Masala Vada, Maddur Vada\nDosa - Masala Dosa, Set Dosa, Rava Dosa\nUpma, Kesaribhath\nPuliyogare\nPongal\nVangibath\nVegetable Bonda\nChaat\nPoori\n\n### Others\nBonda Soup\nPohay\nBhajji – Banana Bhajji, Green Chili Bhajji\nPakora – Onion Pakora, Vegetable Pakora\nThali - vegetable, chicken, mutton\nRajma rice\nIndian Chinese cuisine\nPasta\nBurger (chicken, mutton, veg)\nWraps and rolls\nChaat\nGrilled chicken\nSamosa, patties(E.g.

As the Americas cover a large range of biomes, and there are more than 574 currently federally recognized Native American tribes in the US alone, Indigenous cuisine can vary significantly by region and culture. For example, North American Native cuisine differs from Southwestern and Mexican cuisine in its simplicity and directness of flavor.\n\n## Indigenous cuisine of North America\n\n\n### Country food\nCountry food, in Canada, refers to the  traditional diets of the Indigenous peoples in Canada (known in Canada as First Nations, Metis, and Inuit), especially in remote northern regions where Western food is an expensive import, and traditional foods are still relied upon.\nThe Government of the Northwest Territories estimated in 2015 that nearly half of Northwest Territories residents in smaller communities relied on country food for 75% of their meat and fish intake; in larger communities, the percentage was lower, with the lowest percentage relying on country foods (4%) being in Yellowknife, the capital and only \"large community\".\nThe most common country foods in the Northwest Territories area include mammals and birds (caribou, moose, ducks, geese, seals, hare, grouse, ptarmigan), fish (lake trout, char, inconnu, whitefish, pike, burbot) and berries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, cloudberries).\nIn the eastern Canadian Arctic, Inuit consume a diet of foods that are fished, hunted, and gathered locally. This may include caribou, walrus, ringed seal, bearded seal, beluga whale, polar bear, berries, and fireweed.\nThe cultural value attached to certain game species, and certain parts, varies.  For example, in the James Bay region, a 1982 study found that beluga whale meat was principally used as dog food, whereas the blubber, or muktuk was a \"valued delicacy\".  Value also varies by age, with Inuit preferring younger ring seals, and often using the older ones for dog food.\nContaminants in country foods are a public health concern in Northern Canada; volunteers are tested to track the spread of industrial chemicals from emitters (usually in the South) into the northern food web via the air and water.\nIn 2017, the Government of the Northwest Territories committed to using country foods in the soon-to-open Stanton Territorial Hospital, despite the challenges of obtaining, inspecting, and preparing sufficient quantities of wild game and plants.\nIn Southern Canada, wild foods (especially meats) are relatively rare in restaurants, due to wildlife conservation rules against selling hunted meat, as well as strict meat inspection rules. There is a cultural divide between rural and remote communities that rely on wild foods, and urban Canadians (the majority), who have little or no experience with them.\n\n### Eastern Native American cuisine\nThe essential staple foods of the Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands have traditionally been corn (also known as maize), beans, and squash, known as \"The Three Sisters\" because they were planted interdependently: the beans grew up the tall stalks of the corn, while the squash spread out at the base of the three plants and provided protection and support for the root systems.\nMaple syrup is another essential food staple of the Eastern Woodlands peoples.  Tree sap is collected from sugar maple trees during the beginning of springtime when the nights are still cold. Birch bark containers are used in the process of making maple syrup, maple cakes, maple sugar, and maple taffy.  When the sap is boiled to a certain temperature, different variations of maple food products are created. When the sap starts to thicken, it can be poured into the snow to make taffy.\nSince the first colonists of New England had to adapt their foods to the local crops and resources, the Native influences of Southern New England Algonquian cuisine form a significant part of New England cuisine with dishes such as cornbread, succotash and Johnnycakes and ingredients such as corn, cranberries and local species of clam still enjoyed in the region today.\nThe Wabanaki tribal nations and other eastern woodlands peoples have made nut milk and infant formula made from nuts and cornmeal, while the Cherokee nation made Kanuchi soup from hickory nuts.\n\n### Southeastern Native American cuisine\nSoutheastern Native American culture has contributed to the formation of Southern cuisine from its origins through the present day. From Southeastern Native American culture came one of the main staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize), either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make hominy, using a Native American technique known as nixtamalization. Corn is used to make all kinds of dishes such as the familiar cornbread and grits.\nThough a less important staple, potatoes were also adopted from Native American cuisine and have been used in many ways similar to corn. Native Americans introduced the first non-Native American Southerners to many other vegetables still familiar on southern tables. Squash, pumpkin, many types of beans, many types of peppers, and sassafras all came to the settlers via Indigenous peoples. The Virginia Algonquian word pawcohiccora means hickory-nut meat or a nut milk drink made from it.\nMany fruits are available in this region. Muscadines, blackberries, raspberries, and many other wild berries were part of Southern Native Americans' diet.\n\nTo a far greater degree than anyone realizes, several of the most important food dishes of the Southeastern Indians live on today in the \"soul food\" eaten by both black and white Southerners. Hominy, for example, is still eaten ... Sofkee lives on as grits ... cornbread [is] used by Southern cooks ... Indian fritters ... variously known as \"hoe cake\", ... or \"Johnny cake.\" ... Indians boiled cornbread is present in Southern cuisine as \"corn meal dumplings\", ... and as \"hush puppies\", boiled in oil instead of water. ... Southerners cook their beans and field peas by boiling them, as did the Indians ... Like the Indians they cure their meat and smoke it over hickory coals ...\nSoutheastern Native Americans traditionally supplement their diets with meat from hunting native game. Venison is a vital staple meat, due to the abundance of white-tailed deer in the region. Rabbits, squirrels, opossums, and raccoons are also common. Although it may have been secondary to game hunting, fishing is also an important food source; many peoples lived near rivers and other consistent sources of fish. Indigenous fishing methods in the Southeast include shooting with arrows, spearing or gigging, trapping with weirs or dams, poisoning with fish toxins, bare-hand noodling, and netting. Fish were often roasted, while small or very bony fish were stewed for use in soup.\nLivestock, adopted from Europeans, in the form of hogs and cattle, are also kept. Aside from the more commonly consumed parts of the animal, it is traditional to also eat organ meats such as liver, brains, and intestines. Many of the early settlers were taught Southeastern Native American cooking methods.\n\n### Great Plains Native American cuisine\nIndigenous peoples of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies or Plains Indians have historically relied heavily on American bison (American buffalo) as a staple food source. One traditional method of preparation is to cut the meat into thin slices then dry it, either over a slow fire or in the hot sun, until it is hard and brittle. In this form it can last for months, making it a main ingredient to be combined with other foods, or eaten on its own.\nOne such use could be pemmican, a concentrated mixture of fat and protein, and fruits such as cranberries, Saskatoon berries, blueberries, cherries, chokecherries, and currants are sometimes added.  Many parts of the bison were utilized and prepared in numerous ways, including: \"boiled meat, tripe soup perhaps thickened with brains, roasted intestines, jerked/smoked meat, and raw kidneys, liver, tongue sprinkled with gall or bile were eaten immediately after a kill.\"\nThe animals that Great Plains Indians consumed, like bison, deer, and antelope, were grazing animals. Due to this, they were high in omega-3 fatty acids, an essential fatty acid that many diets lack.\nWhen asked to state traditional staple foods, a group of Plains elders identified prairie turnips (Pediomelum esculentum, syn. Psoralea esculenta), called timpsula or tin'psila in the Lakota language group; fruits (chokecherries, June berries, plums, blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, buffalo berries, gooseberries); potatoes; squash; dried meats (venison, buffalo, jack rabbit, and prairie chicken); and wild rice as being these staple foods.\n\"We landed at a Watlala village 200 men of Flatheads of 25 houses 50 canoes built of Straw, we were treated verry kindly by them, they gave us round root near the size of a hens egg roasted which they call Wap-to (wapato) to eate . . . . which they roasted in the embers until they became Soft\"\n—William Clark, Lewis and Clark Expedition\nWapato (Sagittaria latifolia) has a number of varieties and is found growing in damp marsh area around ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams.  The edible rhizomes were gathered and could be roasted in the embers of a fire, or dried, ground and the meal pressed into a cake which \"served well as bread\" as noted by Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  They are known today as broadleaf arrowhead, arrowhead, duckroot, or duck-potato.\n\n### Western Indigenous cuisine\nIn the Pacific Northwest, traditional diets include salmon and other fish, seafood, mushrooms, berries, roots and tubers, and meats such as deer, duck, and rabbit.\nIn contrast to the Easterners, the Northwestern peoples are traditionally hunter-gatherers, primarily. The generally mild climate led to the development of an economy based on year-round abundant food supplies, rather than having to rely upon seasonal agriculture. Yet, Native American tribes of California still relied on storing food for winter seasons, which included \"nuts, seeds, and dried meat and fish\". Since animals migrated, vegetation is seasonal, and also weather needs to be taken into account.\nIn what is now California, acorns can be ground into a flour that has at times served as the principal foodstuff for about 75 percent of the population, and dried meats can be prepared during the dry season. It seems that acorns and other nuts took priority among indigenous tribes because of the archaeological evidence of \"mortars and pestles\". Grinding acorns requires a lot of resources and time to gather and process them, which implies an area where location is more permanent. Gathering acorns took everyone in the tribe, because within weeks, the acorns would mature. Obtaining food was done communally. Acorns were ground to make soups and bread.\nIndigenous tribes along the California region used \"over 500 species of plants and animals for food\".\nArchaeological methods suggest the use of flames and cutting materials altered bones from rodents. The presence of rodent bones in Quiroste archaeological sites suggests that the Quiroste people ate rodents. \nDeer and seal bones are also found in indigenous communities. This means that the diet is varied, as seals are found near the coast and deer are found further inland. \nOther evidence is through the use of screening that found anchovies to be a source of food for indigenous people. This is a valuable discovery because anchovies are difficult to come by due to their fragile bones.\nIndigenous tribes were consuming the meat of shellfish with the implication of \"bi-pitted cobbles\". The meat of shellfish required stone tools to crack open the shells. \nThe consumption of marrow from animal bones is evident from archaeological analyses of \"hand axes made from andesitic and quartzitic cobbles\". Obtaining bone marrow from an animal requires both time and resources, as it is located in the center of the bone and requires extra effort to extract. \nThe destruction of Native California was done by the missionaries taking over the indigenous land and clearing the environment for their own cultural foodways. This caused some indigenous tribes to become dependent on missionaries for survival.  Archaeological evidence shows that some indigenous tribes were eating cattle because of the reliance they had on missionaries.\nAlthough some tribes relied on the food from missionaries, they still hunted for their own food from the evidence of birds found that know to migrate to the area seasonally. Although they were fed by missionaries, they required more food. That's when their own foodways came into play for hunting and preparing the food they captured.\nNative tribes living along the confines of missionaries were only able to gather \"wheat, maize, barley, and peach\". \nFood not only played an important role in subsistence but also an important role in ceremonies, especially to mourn someone's death. \nThe preparation for making atole was done by toasting the wheat before it was granulated.\nThere are still indigenous people who are keeping their traditions alive through modern cuisine. Crystal Wahpepah sees her kitchen as a way to promote indigenous \"food sovereignty and the reclamation of ancestral knowledge\".\n\n### Southwestern Indigenous cuisine\nAncestral Puebloans of the present-day Four Corners region of the United States, comprising Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, initially practiced subsistence agriculture by cultivating maize, beans, squash, sunflower seeds, and pine nuts from the pinyon pine, and game meat including venison and cuniculture, and freshwater fish such as Rio Grande cutthroat trout and rainbow trout are also traditional foods in the region.\nAncestral Puebloans are also known for their basketry and pottery, indicating both an agricultural surplus that needed to be carried and stored, and clay pot cooking. Grinding stones have been used to grind maize into meal for cooking. Archaeological digs indicate a very early domestication of turkeys for food.\nNew Mexican cuisine is heavily rooted in both Pueblo and Hispano food traditions, and is a prevalent cuisine in the American Southwest, especially in New Mexico.\nThe 2002 Foods of the Southwest Indian Nations won a James Beard Award, the first Native American cookbook so honored. Publishers had told the author, Lois Ellen Frank, that there was no such thing as Native American cuisine.\n\n### Alaska Native cuisine\nAlaska Native cuisine consists of nutrient-dense foods such as seal, fish (salmon), and moose.  Along with these, berries (huckleberries) and bird eggs are traditionally consumed by Alaska Natives.\nSeal, walruses, and polar bears are the large game that Alaska Natives hunt. Smaller game includes whitefish, Arctic char, Arctic hare, and ptarmigan.\nDue to weather, edible plants like berries are only available to be consumed in the summer, so people have a diet very high in fat and protein, but low in carbohydrates.\nThe game that is hunted is also used for clothing. The intestines of large mammals are used to make waterproof clothing and caribou fur is used to make warm clothing.\n\n### Dishes\nAcorn bread\nAcorn crepe \nAcorn mush, from the Miwok people\nAkutaq, also called \"Eskimo ice cream\", made from caribou or moose tallow and meat, berries, seal oil, and sometimes fish, whipped together with snow or water\nBannock, is a type of frybread that is eaten equally in the Arctic, Plains, Sub-Arctic, and Pacific cultural areas\nBean bread, made with corn meal and beans, popular among the Cherokee\nBird brain stew, from the Cree nation\nBlack drink or asi, a Southeastern ceremonial drink made from the yaupon holly\nBuffalo stew, from the Lakota and Cherokee people, also called tanka-me-a-lo\nCornbread and corn pone—the word pone derives from the word for 'bread' in some Eastern Algonquian languages, such as Powhatan apon and Lenape ahpòn\nDried meats like jerky and smoked salmon strips\nFilé powder, made from sassafras leaves, used by the Choctaw for flavoring and thickening soups and stews as well as for herbal medicine\nFrybread, a dish made from ingredients distributed to Native Americans living on reservations\nGreen chili stew\nHopi tea, an herbal tea made from Thelesperma megapotamicum\nLu'sknikn, the Mi'kmaq form of Bannock.\nMutton stew, from the Navajo people\nNokake, Algonquian hoecakes, made of cornmeal\nNut milk, from the Wabanaki\nPemmican, a concentrated food consisting of dried pulverized meat, dried berries, and rendered fat.\n\nPiki bread, from the Hopi people\nPsindamoakan, a Lenape hunter's food made of parched cornmeal mixed with maple sugar\nPueblo bread\nSalted salmon, an Inuit dish of brined salmon in a heavy concentration of salt water, left for months to soak up salts\nSapan (Unami pronunciation: [ˈsaːpːən]), cornmeal mush, a staple of Lenape cuisine\nStink fish, an Inuit dish of dried fish, kept underground until ripe, for later consumption; also done with fish heads\nSuccotash, a dish of beans and corn\nSumac lemonade, a Native American beverage made from sumac berries\nTiswin, a term used for several fermented beverages in the Southwest, including a corn or fruit beer of the Apache and a saguaro fruit beer of the Tohono O'odham\nWalrus flipper soup, an Inuit dish made from walrus flippers\nWojapi, a Plains Indian pudding of mashed, cooked berries\n\n### Restaurants\n\n\n## Indigenous cuisine of the Circum-Caribbean\nThis region comprises the cultures of the Arawaks, the Caribs, and the Ciboney. The Taíno of the Greater Antilles were the first New World people to encounter Columbus. Prior to European contact, these groups foraged, hunted, and fished.

    "text": "# Indonesian cuisine\n\nIndonesian cuisine is a collection of regional culinary traditions of the various ethnic groups that form the archipelagic nation of Indonesia. There are a wide variety of recipes and cuisines in part because Indonesia is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 17,508 in the world's largest archipelago, with more than 600 ethnic groups.\nThere are many regional cuisines, often based upon indigenous cultures, with some foreign influences.\n\n## Tradition and characteristics\nIndonesia has around 5,350 traditional recipes, with 30 of them considered the most important. Indonesia's cuisine ranges from rice, noodle and soup dishes in modest local eateries to street-side snacks to elaborate dishes in expensive restaurants.\nIndonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences. Sumatran cuisine, for example, has Middle Eastern and Indian influences, featuring curried meat and vegetables such as gulai and curry, while Javanese cuisine is mostly indigenous, with some hints of Chinese influence.\nThe cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen throughout Indonesian cuisine: foods such as noodles, meat balls, spring rolls, and wontons have been completely assimilated.\nThroughout its history, Indonesia has been involved in trade due to its location and natural resources. The country's indigenous techniques and ingredients were influenced by India, the Middle East, China, and Europe. Spanish and Portuguese traders brought New World produce even before the Dutch came to colonize most of the archipelago. Indonesia's Moluccas Islands (Maluku), which are famed as \"the Spice Islands\", contributed to the introduction of spices such as cloves and nutmeg to Indonesian and global cuisine.\nIndonesian cuisine often has complex flavours, acquired from certain ingredients and bumbu spice mixtures. Indonesian dishes have rich flavours; usually described as savory, hot and spicy, and also combination of basic tastes such as sweet, salty, sour and bitter. Most Indonesians favour hot and spicy food, thus sambal, Indonesian spicy chili sauce with various optional ingredients, notably shrimp paste, shallots, and others, is a staple condiment at all Indonesian tables. The seven main Indonesian cooking methods are frying, grilling, roasting, dry roasting, sautéing, boiling and steaming.\n\nSome popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, gado-gado, satay, and soto are ubiquitous in the country and are considered national dishes. The official national dish of Indonesia is tumpeng, chosen in 2014 by Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy as the dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia's various culinary traditions. Later in 2018, the same ministry has chosen 5 national dish of Indonesia; they are soto, rendang, satay, nasi goreng, and gado-gado.\n\nToday, some popular dishes that originated in Indonesia are now common to neighbouring countries, Malaysia and Singapore. Indonesian dishes such as satay, beef rendang, and sambal are popular in Malaysia and Singapore. Soy-based dishes, such as variations of tofu and tempeh, are also very popular. Tempeh is regarded as a Javanese invention, a local adaptation of soy-based food fermentation and production. Another fermented food is oncom, similar in some ways to tempeh but using a variety of bases (not only soy), created by different fungi, and particularly popular in West Java.\n\n## History\nIndonesian cuisine has a long history—although most of it is not well-documented, and relied heavily on local practice and oral traditions. An exception is Javanese cuisine, which has quite a well-documented culinary tradition. \nThe diversity ranges from ancient bakar batu or stone-grilled yams and boar practiced by Papuan tribes of eastern Indonesia, to sophisticated contemporary Indonesian fusion cuisine. The ethnic diversity of Indonesian archipelago provides an eclectic combination — mixing local Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, Minang, Malay and other native cuisine traditions, with centuries worth of foreign contacts with Indian traders, Chinese migrants and Dutch colonials.\n\nRice has been an essential staple for Indonesian society, as bas-reliefs of 9th century Borobudur and Prambanan describes rice farming in ancient Java. Ancient dishes were mentioned in many Javanese inscriptions and historians have succeeded in deciphering some of them. Inscriptions from the 8th to 10th century Kingdom of Mataram era mention several ancient dishes, among others are hadaŋan haraŋ (minced water buffalo meat satay, similar with today Balinese sate lilit), hadaŋan madura (water buffalo meat simmered with sweet palm sugar), and dundu puyengan (eel seasoned with lemon basil). Also various haraŋ-haraŋ (grilled meats) either celeṅ/wök (pork), hadahan/kbo (water buffalo), kidaŋ/knas (deer) or wḍus (goat). Ancient beverages include nalaka rasa (sugarcane juice), jati wangi (jasmine beverage), and kinca (tamarind juice). Also various kuluban (boiled vegetables served in spices, similar with today urap) and phalamula (boiled yams and tubers served with liquid palm sugar). Other ancient vegetable dishes include rumwah-rumwah (lalap), dudutan (raw vegetables) and tetis.\nThe 9th century Old Javanese Kakawin Ramayana mentions cooking technique as Trijata offered Sita some food (canto 17.101); scrumptious food of landuga tatla-tila (cooked with oil) and modakanda sagula (sugared delicacies).\nSeveral foods are mentioned in Javanese inscriptions dated from the 10th to 15th centuries. Some of this dishes are identified with present-day Javanese foods. Among others are pecel, pindang, rarawwan (rawon), rurujak (rujak), kurupuk (krupuk), sweets like wajik and dodol, also beverages like dawet.\nIn the 15th century Sundanese manuscript Sanghyang Siksa Kandang Karesian, it was mentioned the common Sundanese food flavours of that times which includes; lawana (salty), kaduka (hot and spicy), tritka (bitter), amba (sour), kasaya (savoury), and madura (sweet).\nBy the 13th to 15th century, coastal Indonesian polities began to absorb culinary influences from India and the Middle East, as evidence with the adoption of curry-like recipes in the region. This was especially the case in the coastal towns of Aceh, Minangkabau lands of West Sumatra, and Malay ports of Sumatra and Malay peninsula. Subsequently, those culinary traditions displayed typical Indian culinary influences, such as kare (curry), roti cane and gulai. This also went hand in hand with the adoption of Islamic faith, thus encouraged halal Muslim dietary law that omits pork. On the other hand, the indigenous inhabitant that resides inland—such as the Bataks and Dayaks, retains their older Austronesian culinary traditions, which incorporate bushmeat, pork and blood in their daily diet.\n\nAccording to the 17th century account of Rijklof van Goens, the ambassador of the VOC for Sultan Agung's Javanese Mataram court, meat (sheep, goat, and buffalo) was prepared for celebrations in Java by grilling and frying the seasoned meat. Unlike Europeans, the Javanese primarily use coconut oil instead of butter.\nChinese immigrants settled in the Indonesian archipelago as early as the Majapahit period, circa 15th century CE, and came in larger numbers during the Dutch colonial period. The Chinese settlers introduced stir-frying technique that required the use of the Chinese wok and a small amount of cooking oil. They also introduced some new Chinese cuisine—including soy sauce, noodles and soybean processing technique to make tofu. Subsequently, soybean processing led to the possibly accidental discovery of tempeh (fermented soybean cake). The earliest known reference to tempeh appeared in 1815 in the Javanese manuscript of Serat Centhini.\nIndonesian culinary traditions have been exposed to various influences. The vigor of spice trade during the Age of Discovery has brought European traders to Indonesian shores. Subsequently, European colonialism was established in the 19th century Dutch East Indies. The influences of European cuisine—most notably Portuguese and Dutch, introduced European techniques, especially in terms of bread-making, pastries, cookies and cake-baking.\nEach region has developed a specificity that ultimately leads to localization of regional taste.\n\n## Customs, serving and consumption\nIndonesian traditional meals usually consists of steamed rice as staple, surrounded by vegetables and soup and meat or fish side dishes. In a typical family meal, the family members gather around the table filled with steamed rice and several other dishes. Each dish is placed in a large communal plate or in bowls. Each of these dishes has its own serving spoons, used only to move food from the communal plate to one's personal plate. Each of the family members has their own personal plate that is first filled with steamed rice. Usually the oldest family member or the husband has the right to initiate the meal, followed by the rest of the family to help themselves with the dishes. Each of them take some portion of dishes from the communal plates into their own individual plates.\n\nOn their personal plate, the steamed rice will soon be surrounded by two, three or more dishes; vegetables and fish or meat, and maybe some fried dishes, sambal and krupuk. In Indonesian customs — unlike in Japanese their counterpart — it is quite acceptable to be seen to mix the various dishes on a personal plate during consumption. A practice commonly found in nasi campur, nasi Padang, or during a buffet. The soupy dish might be served in a separate small personal bowl. Today in contemporary Indonesian restaurants, a set menu is often offered. This has led to the personal serving practice, in a similar fashion to those of Japanese cuisine, with a personal plate on a tray, a rattan or bamboo container each with a separate small portion of dishes surrounding the rice. This can be found in the presentation of nasi Bali.\n\nIndonesian meals are commonly eaten with a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand (to push the food onto the spoon). Unlike the European dining custom, knives are absent from the dining table, thus most of the ingredients such as vegetables and meat are already cut into bite-size pieces prior to serving. In some parts of the country, such as West Java, Gorontalo and West Sumatra, it is also common to eat with one's bare hands.\nIn restaurants or households that commonly use bare hands to eat, such as seafood food stalls, traditional Sundanese and Minangkabau restaurants, or East Javanese pecel lele (fried catfish with sambal) and ayam goreng (fried chicken) food stalls, kobokan is usually served along with the food. Kobokan is a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent, this bowl of water is not intended for consumption, rather it is used to wash one's hand before and after eating.\nChopsticks are generally only used in food stalls or restaurants serving Indonesian adaptations of Chinese cuisine, such as bakmie or mie ayam (chicken noodle) with pangsit (wonton), mie goreng (fried noodles), and kwetiau goreng (fried flat rice noodles).\n\n## Staples\n\n\n### Rice\nRice is a staple for all classes in contemporary Indonesia and occupies a central place in Indonesian culture: it shapes the landscape; is sold at markets; and is served in most meals both as a savoury and a sweet food. The importance of rice in Indonesian culture is demonstrated through the reverence of Dewi Sri, the rice goddess of ancient Java and Bali. Traditionally the agricultural cycles linked to rice cultivations were celebrated through rituals, such as Seren Taun rice harvest festival.\nRice is most often eaten plain with just a few protein and vegetable dishes on the side. It is also served as nasi uduk (rice cooked in coconut milk), nasi kuning (rice cooked with coconut milk and turmeric), ketupat (rice steamed in woven packets of coconut fronds), lontong (rice steamed in banana leaves), intip or rengginang (rice crackers), desserts, vermicelli, noodles, arak beras (rice wine), and nasi goreng (fried rice). Nasi goreng is omnipresent in Indonesia and considered a national dish.\n\nRice was only incorporated into diets as either the technology to grow it, or the ability to buy it from elsewhere, was gained. Evidence of wild rice on the island of Sulawesi dates from 3000 BCE. Evidence for the earliest cultivation come from the eighth century stone inscriptions from the central island of Java, which shows that kings levied taxes in rice. Images of rice cultivation, rice barns, and pest mice infesting a ricefield are included in the Karmawibhanga bas-reliefs of Borobudur. Divisions of labour between men, women, and animals that are still in place in Indonesian rice cultivation were carved into relief friezes on the ninth century Prambanan temples in Central Java: a water buffalo attached to a plough; women planting seedlings and pounding grain; and a man carrying sheaves of rice on each end of a pole across his shoulders (pikulan). In the sixteenth century, Europeans visiting the Indonesian islands saw rice as a new prestige food served to the aristocracy during ceremonies and feasts.\nRice production in Indonesian history is linked to the development of iron tools and the domestication of wild Asian water buffalo as water buffalo for cultivation of fields and manure for fertiliser. Rice production requires exposure to the sun. Once covered in dense forest, much of the Indonesian landscape has been gradually cleared for permanent fields and settlements as rice cultivation developed over the last fifteen hundred years.\n\n### Wheat\nWheat is not a native plant to Indonesia. Through imports and foreign influences — most notably Chinese and Dutch — Indonesians acquired a taste for wheat-based foodstuffs, especially Chinese noodles, Indian roti, and Dutch bread. Other than common steamed rice, the Chinese in Indonesia also considered noodles, bakpao and cakwe as staples. Yet in Indonesia, especially in Java and Sumatra, the rice culture was so prevalent that sometimes these wheat-based dishes, such as noodles are treated as side dishes and are consumed with rice, while others such as Chinese buns and cakwe are treated as snacks. Europeans, especially the Portuguese and the Dutch, introduced bread and various types of baked goods and pastry. These European staples have now become alternatives for a quick breakfast.\nIndonesian wheat consumption reached a new height after the advent of the Indonesian instant noodle industry in the 1970s. Since then, Indonesia has become one of the world's major producers and consumers of instant noodles. Indonesia is the world's second largest instant noodle market only after China, with demand reaching 12.54 billion servings in 2018. Today, instant noodles have become a staple in Indonesian households for quick hot meals. Certain brands such as Indomie have become household names.\n\n### Other staples\nOther staple foods in Indonesia include a number of starchy tubers such as yam, sweet potato, potato, taro and cassava. Starchy fruit such as breadfruit and jackfruit and grains such as maize are eaten. A sago congee called papeda is a staple food especially in Maluku and Papua. Sago is often mixed with water and cooked as a simple pancake. Next to sago, people of eastern Indonesia consume wild tubers as staple food.\nMany types of tubers such as talas (a type of taro but larger and more bland) and breadfruit are native to Indonesia, while others were introduced from elsewhere. Yam was introduced from Africa; while potato, sweet potato, cassava and maize were introduced from the Americas through Spanish influence and reached Java in the 17th century. Cassava is usually boiled, steamed, fried or processed as a popular snack kripik singkong (cassava crackers). Dried cassava, locally known as tiwul, is an alternate staple food in arid areas of Java such as Gunung Kidul and Wonogiri, while other roots and tubers are eaten especially in hard times. Maize is eaten in drier regions such as Madura and islands east of the Wallace Line, such as the Lesser Sunda Islands.\n\n## Vegetables\nA number of leaf vegetables are widely used in Indonesian cuisine, such as kangkung, spinach, genjer, melinjo, papaya and cassava leaves. These are often sauteed with garlic. Spinach and corn are used in clear, watery vegetable soups like sayur bayam bening, flavoured with temu kunci, garlic and shallot. Clear vegetable soup includes sayur oyong. Other vegetables, like calabash, chayote, kelor, yardlong bean, eggplant, gambas and belustru, are cut and used in stir-fries, curries and soups like sayur asem, sayur lodeh or laksa. Daun ubi tumbuk is a pounded cassava leaves dish, found in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Sayur sop is cabbage, cauliflower, potato, carrot, with macaroni spiced with black pepper, garlic and shallot in chicken or beef broth. Similar mixed vegetables are also stir-fried as cap cai, a popular dish of the Chinese Indonesian cuisine. Tumis kangkung is a popular stir-fried water spinach dish.\nVegetables like winged bean, tomato, cucumber and small bitter melon are commonly eaten raw, like in lalab. The large bitter melon variety is usually boiled. Kecombrang and papaya flower buds are a common Indonesian vegetable. Urap is seasoned and spiced shredded coconut mixed together with vegetables. Asinan betawi are preserved vegetables. Gado-gado and pecel are a salad of boiled vegetables dressed in a peanut-based spicy sauce, while karedok is its raw version.\n\n### Vegetarianism in Indonesia\nVegetarianism is well represented in Indonesia, as a wide selection of vegetarian dishes and meat substitutes are served. According to a Euromonitor International survey conducted in 2018, Indonesia has the third-highest rate of vegetarianism growth. Dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, tauge goreng, pecel, urap, rujak and asinan are vegetarian dishes. However, dishes that use peanut sauce, such as gado-gado, karedok or ketoprak, might contain small amounts of shrimp paste, called \"terasi\". Shrimp paste is also often used to add flavour to spicy sambal chili paste served with lalap, assorted fresh vegetables. Fermented soy products, such as tempeh, \"tahu\" (tofu) and oncom are prevalent as meat substitutes and as a source of vegetable protein. In contemporary fusion cuisine, tempeh is used to replace meat patties and served as tempeh burgers.\nMost Indonesians do not practice strict vegetarianism and may consume vegetables or vegetarian dishes for their taste, preference, economic and health reasons. Small numbers of Indonesian Buddhists that practice vegetarianism for religious reasons.\n\n## Meat and fish\nThe main animal protein sources in the Indonesian diet are poultry and fish, while meats such as beef, water buffalo, goat and mutton are also commonly found in the Indonesian marketplaces.\n\n### Poultry\nThe most common poultry consumed is chicken, followed by duck. Pigeon, quail and wild swamp birds such as watercock are also consumed. Traditionally, Indonesians breed free-range chickens in the villages known as ayam kampung (village chicken). Compared to common mass-farmed chickens, these village chickens are thinner and their meat is slightly firmer. \nVarious recipes of ayam goreng (fried chicken) and ayam bakar (grilled chicken) are commonly found throughout Indonesia. Other than frying or grilling, chicken might be cooked as soup, such as sup ayam or soto ayam, or cooked in coconut milk as opor ayam. Chicken satay is also commonly found in Indonesia; it is barbecued on skewers and served with peanut sauce. Popular chicken recipes include ayam goreng kalasan from Yogyakarta, ayam bakar padang from Padang, ayam taliwang from Lombok, ayam betutu from Bali, and ayam goreng lengkuas (galangal fried chicken).\n\n### Meat\nBeef and goat meat are the most commonly consumed meats in Indonesia, while kerbau (water buffalo) and domestic sheep are also consumed to a lesser degree, since water buffalo are more useful for ploughing the rice paddies, while sheep are kept for their wool or to be used for the traditional entertainment of ram fighting. As a country with an Islamic majority, Indonesian Muslims follow the Islamic halal dietary law which forbids the consumption of pork.\nIn other parts of Indonesia where there are significant numbers of non-Muslims, boar and pork are commonly consumed. Dishes made of non-halal meats can be found in provinces such as Bali, North Sumatra, North Sulawesi, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, West Papua, Papua, and also in the Chinatowns of major Indonesian cities. Today to cater for the larger Muslim market, most of the restaurants and eating establishments in Indonesia put halal signs that signify that they serve neither pork nor any non-halal meats, nor do they use lard in their cooking. With a large Muslim population and a relatively small number of cattle, today Indonesians rely heavily on imported beef from Australia, New Zealand, India and the United States which often results in a scarcity and raised prices of beef in the Indonesian market.\nThe meat can be cooked in rich spices and coconut milk such as beef, goat or lamb rendang, skewered, seasoned and grilled chicken or mutton as satay, barbecued meats, or sliced and cooked in rich broth soup as soto. Muttons and various offals can be use as ingredients for soto soup or gulai curry. In Bali, with its Hindu majority, the babi guling (pig roast) is popular among locals as well as non-Muslim visitors, while the Batak people of North Sumatra have babi panggang that is a similar dish. Wild boar are also commonly consumed in Papua. The meat also can be processed to be thinly sliced and dried as dendeng (jerky), or made into abon (meat floss). Dendeng celeng is Indonesian \"dried, jerked\" boar meat. Raised rabbits are also consumed as food in mountainous region of Indonesia.\nSome game meat such as venison might be sold and consumed in some areas of Indonesia. In Kalimantan, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, and Papua, deer meat can be found, usually wildly acquired by hunting. Other unusual and often controversial exotic meats include frog legs and softshell turtle consumed in Chinese Indonesian and Javanese cuisine, horse meat consumed in Yogyakarta, West Nusa Tenggara, and South Sulawesi, turtle meat consumed in Bali and Eastern Indonesia, snake, biawak (monitor lizard), paniki (fruit bats), dog meat, cat meat, and field rats consumed in Minahasan cuisine of North Sulawesi. Batak cuisine of North Sumatra is also familiar with cooking dog meat, while its consumption is diminishing in Central Java. Exotic and rare game meat such as crocodile, squirrel, civet, and monkey might also be sold and consumed in wilder parts of Indonesia.\n\n### Fish\nIn an archipelagic nation, seafood is abundant, and it is commonly consumed especially by Indonesian residents in coastal areas. Fish is especially popular in the eastern Indonesian regions of Sulawesi and Maluku, where most of the people work as fishermen. Both areas have a vast sea which brings them many different kinds of seafood.\nPopular seafood in Indonesian cuisine includes skipjack tuna, tuna, mackerel, pomfret, wahoo, milkfish, trevally, rabbitfish, abalistes stellatus, amberjacks, rastrelliger, yellowtail scad, nemipterus japonicus, garoupa, red snapper, anchovy, swordfish, shark, stingray, squid or cuttlefish, shrimp, crab, blue crab, and mussel.\nSeafood is commonly consumed across Indonesia, but it is especially popular in Maluku islands, Gorontalo Peninsula and Minahasa (North Sulawesi) cuisine. Seafood is usually grilled, boiled or fried. Ikan bakar is a popular grilled fish dish that can be found throughout Indonesia. The method of cooking like stir fried in spices or in soup is also possible. Salted fish is preserved seafood through cured in salt, it also can be found in Indonesian market.\nFresh water fisheries can be found in inland regions or in areas with large rivers or lakes. Fresh water fishes are popular in Sundanese cuisine of West Java, caught or raised in Lake Toba in Batak lands of North Sumatra, or taken from large rivers in Malay lands of Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra, or large rivers in Kalimantan. Popular fresh water fish among others; carp, gourami, catfish, pangasius (especially the iridescent shark), snakehead, trichogaster, climbing gourami, Nile tilapia, and Mozambique tilapia. Freshwater snails such as pila ampullacea, is also consumed in the country, either by boiling or grilling it's meat as a satay.\n\n### Insects\nUnlike Thailand, in Indonesia insect is not a popular food ingredient nor widely available as street food. In Java, locals do catch, breed and sell certain species of insects, usually sold fresh or alive as pet bird feed. Nevertheless, traditionally several cultures in Indonesia are known to consume insects, especially grasshopper, cricket, termite, also the larvae of sago palm weevil, bee and dragonfly. In Java and Kalimantan, grasshoppers and crickets are usually lightly battered and deep fried in palm oil as crispy kripik snack. Smaller grasshoppers, crickets and termites might be made as rempeyek batter cracker which resembles insect fossil. During monsoon rainy season, flying termites are abundant being attracted to lightbulbs to mate. Locals usually put a bucket of water under the lamp to trap the flying termites, pluck the wings, and roast the termites as additional protein-rich snack. In Banyuwangi, East Java, there is a specialty dish called botok tawon (honeybee botok), which is beehives that contains bee larvae, being seasoned in shredded coconut and spices, wrapped inside banana leaf package and steamed. Dayak tribes of Kalimantan, also Moluccans and Papuan tribes in Eastern Indonesia, are known to consumes ulat sagu (lit. sagoo caterpillar) or larvae of sago palm weevil. This protein-rich larvae are considered a delicacy in Papua, and often being roasted prior of consumption. Locals may also commonly eat the larvae raw or alive. In Bali, dragonflies are also consumed by processing them into pepes.\n\n## Spices and other flavourings\n\"Rempah\" is the Indonesian word for spice, while \"bumbu\" is the Indonesian word for a spice mixture or seasoning, and it commonly appears in the names of certain spice mixtures, sauces and seasoning pastes.\nKnown throughout the world as the \"Spice Islands\", the Indonesian islands of Maluku contributed to the introduction of its native spices to world cuisine. Spices such as nutmeg or mace, clove, pandan leaves, keluwak and galangal are native to Indonesia. It is likely that black pepper, turmeric, lemongrass, shallot, cinnamon, candlenut, coriander and tamarind were introduced from India, while ginger, scallions and garlic were introduced from China. Those spices from mainland Asia were introduced early, in ancient times, thus they became integral ingredients in Indonesian cuisine.\nIn ancient times, the kingdom of Sunda and the later sultanate of Banten were well known as the world's major producers of black pepper. The maritime empires of Srivijaya and Majapahit also benefited from the lucrative spice trade between the spice islands with China and India. Later the Dutch East India Company controlled the spice trade between Indonesia and the world.\n\n### Sambal\nThe Indonesian fondness for hot and spicy food was enriched when the Spanish introduced chili pepper from the New World to the region in the 16th century. After that hot and spicy sambals have become an important part of Indonesian cuisine.\nIndonesia has perhaps the richest variants of sambals. In the Indonesian archipelago, there are as many as 300 varieties of sambal. The intensity ranges from mild to very hot. Sambal evolved into many variants across Indonesia, ones of the most popular is sambal terasi (sambal belacan) and sambal mangga muda (unripe mango sambal). Sambal terasi is a combination of chilies, sharp fermented shrimp paste called terasi, tangy lime juice, sugar and salt all pounded up with mortar and pestle. Dabu-dabu is a combined Gorontalo and North Sulawesi style of sambal with chopped fresh tomato, chili, and lime juice.\n\nSambal, especially sambal ulek, or sambal terasi can also become a base ingredient for many dishes, such as sambal raja (a dish from Kutai), terong balado, dendeng balado, ayam bumbu rujak, sambal goreng ati, among other things.\n\n### Sauces and seasonings\nSoy sauce is also an important flavourings in Indonesian cuisine. Kecap asin (salty or common soy sauce) was adopted from Chinese cuisine, however Indonesian developed their own kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) with generous addition of palm sugar into soy sauce. Sweet soy sauce is an important marinade for barbecued meat and fish, such as satay and grilled fishes. Sweet soy sauce is also an important ingredient for semur, Indonesian stew.\n\n### Peanut sauce\nOne of the main characteristics of Indonesian cuisine is the wide application of peanuts in many Indonesian signature dishes, such as satay, gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, and pecel. All of these dishes applied ample of bumbu kacang (peanut sauce) for flavouring. Gado-gado and satay, for example, have been considered Indonesian national dishes.\nIntroduced from Mexico by Portuguese and Spanish merchants in the 16th century, peanuts assumed a place within Indonesian cuisine as a key ingredient. Peanuts thrived in the tropical environment of Southeast Asia, and today they can be found, roasted and chopped finely, in many recipes. Whole, halved, or crushed peanuts are used to garnish a variety of dishes, and used in marinades and dipping sauces such as sambal kacang (a mixture of ground chilies and fried peanuts) for otak-otak or ketan. Peanut oil, extracted from peanuts, is one of the most commonly used cooking oils in Indonesia.\nBumbu kacang or peanut sauce represents a sophisticated, earthy seasoning rather than a sweet, gloppy sauce. It should have a delicate balance of savoury, sweet, sour, and spicy flavours, acquired from various ingredients, such as fried peanuts, gula jawa (coconut sugar), garlic, shallots, ginger, tamarind, lemon juice, lemongrass, salt, chilli, peppercorns, sweet soy sauce, ground together and mixed with water to form the right consistency. The secret to good peanut sauce is \"not too thick and not too watery\". Indonesian peanut sauce tends to be less sweet than the Thai version, which is a hybrid adaptation. Gado-gado is a popular dish particularly associated with bumbu kacang, and is eaten across Indonesia.\n\n### Coconut milk\nCoconuts are abundant in tropical Indonesia, and since ancient times Indonesians developed many and various uses for this plant. The broad use of coconut milk in dishes throughout the archipelago is another common characteristic of Indonesian cuisine. It is used in recipes ranging from savoury dishes – such as rendang, soto, gulai, mie koclok, sayur lodeh, gudeg, and opor ayam – to desserts – such as es cendol and es doger.\nThe use of coconut milk is not exclusive to Indonesian cuisine. It can also be found in Indian, Samoan, Thai, Malaysian, Filipino, and Brazilian cuisines. Nonetheless, the use of coconut milk is quite extensive in Indonesia, especially in Minangkabau cuisine and Gorontalese cuisine, although in Minahasan (North Sulawesi) cuisine, coconut milk is generally absent, except in Minahasan cakes and desserts such as klappertaart.\n\nIn Indonesian cuisine, two types of coconut milk are found, thin coconut milk and thick coconut milk. The difference depends on the water and oil content. Thin coconut milk is usually used for soups such as sayur lodeh and soto, while the thicker variety is used for rendang and desserts. It can be made from freshly shredded coconut meat in traditional markets, or can be found processed in cartons at the supermarket.\nAfter the milk has been extracted from the shredded coconut flesh to make coconut milk, the ampas kelapa (leftover coconut flesh) can still be used in urap, seasoned and spiced shredded coconut meat mixed together with vegetables. Leftover shredded coconut can also be cooked, sauteed and seasoned to make serundeng, almost powdery sweet and spicy finely shredded coconut. Kerisik paste, added to thicken rendang, is another use of coconut flesh. To acquire a rich taste, some households insist on using freshly shredded coconut, instead of leftover, for urap and serundeng. Serundeng can be mixed with meat in dishes such as serundeng daging (beef serundeng) or sprinkled on top of other dishes such as soto or ketan (sticky rice). An example of the heavy use of coconut is burasa from Makassar, rice wrapped in banana leaf cooked with coconut milk and sprinkled with powdered coconut similar to serundeng.\n\n## Cooking method\nMost of the common Indonesian dishes are named according to their main ingredients and cooking method. For example, ayam goreng is ayam (chicken) and goreng (frying), which denotes fried chicken. Mie goreng is fried noodle, ikan bakar is grilled fish, udang rebus is boiled shrimp, babi panggang is roasted pork and tumis kangkung is stir fried water spinach. Cooking methods in Indonesian kitchen are goreng (frying) either in a small amount of oil or deep frying with a lot of cooking oil, tumis (stir frying), sangrai (sautéing). Roasting methods are bakar (grilling) usually employing charcoal, firewood, or coconut shell, panggang (baking/roasting) usually refer to baking employing oven. Other methods are rebus (boiling), kukus (steaming) and asap/salai (smoking).\nThe fire used in cooking can be either a strong fire or a small fire for slow cooking. Cooking nasi goreng usually employs strong fire, while authentic rendang for example requires a small fire for slow cooking of beef, spices, and coconut milk until the meat is caramelised and all the coconut milk's liquid has evaporated. Traditional Indonesian dapur (kitchen) usually employs firewood-fuelled kitchen stove, while the contemporary household today uses liquefied petroleum gas-fuelled stove or an electric stove. The ingredients could be cut into pieces, sliced thinly, or ground into a paste. Cooking utensils are wajan (wok), penggorengan (frying pan), panci (cauldron), knives, several types of spoon and fork, parutan (shredder), cobek and ulekan (stone mortar and pestle). Traditionally Indonesians use a stone mortar and a pestle to grind the spices and ingredients into coarse or fine pastes. Today most households use blender or food processor for the task. Traditional Indonesian cooking wares are usually made from stone, earthenware pottery, wood, and woven bamboo or a rattan container or filter, while contemporary cooking wares, plates and containers use metals – iron, tin, stainless steel, aluminium, ceramics, plastics, and also glass.\n\n## National dishes\nInitially during the early years of Indonesian independence, the ubiquitous and highly popular nasi goreng was considered the national dish of the republic, albeit at that time was unofficial. Its simplicity and versatility has contributed to its popularity and made it as a staple among Indonesian households—colloquially considered the most \"democratic\" dish since the absence of an exact and rigid recipe has allowed people to do anything they want with it. \nNasi goreng that is commonly consumed daily in Indonesian households was considered the quintessential dish that represent an Indonesian family. It is in the menu, introduced, offered and served in Indonesian Theatre Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Howard Palfrey Jones, the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of Sukarno's reign in the mid 1960s, in his memoir \"Indonesia: The Possible Dream\", said that he likes nasi goreng. He described his fondness for nasi goreng cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno's wives, and praised it as the most delicious nasi goreng he ever tasted. Nevertheless, other widely popular Indonesian dishes, such as satay, soto and gado-gado are also considered strong contenders. Soto is ubiquitous in Indonesia and considered one of Indonesia's national dishes.\nIn 2014, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy in an effort to promote Indonesian cuisine, has chosen tumpeng as an official Indonesian national dish. Technically tumpeng refer to the rice cone in the center, while the surrounding various dishes might be taken from any choice of various Indonesian dishes—thus was considered ideal as a national dish that binds the diversity of Indonesia's various culinary traditions. Subsequently the designation of tumpeng as the single national dish of Indonesia was considered insufficient to describe the diversity of Indonesian culinary traditions. Later in 2018, the same ministry has chosen another additional 5 national dishes of Indonesia; they are soto, satay, nasi goreng, rendang and gado-gado.\nSatay and soto are notable and the natural choice to be promoted as Indonesian national dish, since they had transcends the cultural boundaries of myriad ethnic groups of Indonesia—those dishes has been extremely localised and has branched into various recipes nationwide. For example, there are rich variants of satay and soto recipes throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra to Eastern Indonesia. Each cultures, ethnics, or even cities had adopted these dishes, and thus developed their own version in accordance to their own culture, tradition, creativity, localised taste and preference, also the availability of local ingredients.\n\n## Regional dishes\n\n\n### Jakarta\nDiverse and eclectic, Betawi cuisine of Jakarta draw culinary influences from Chinese, Malay, Sundanese, to Arab, Indian and European. Popular Betawi dishes include nasi uduk (coconut rice), sayur asem (sweet and sour vegetable soup), asinan (salad of pickled vegetables), gado-gado, (boiled or blanched vegetables salad in peanut sauce), ketoprak, (vegetables, tofu, rice vermicelli and rice cake in peanut sauce), and kerak telor (spiced coconut omelette). Born from a creole or hybrid phenomena, the Betawi cuisine is quite similar to the Peranakan cuisine.\n\n### West Java\nA textural speciality of Sunda (West Java) is karedok, a fresh salad made with long beans, bean sprouts, and cucumber with a spicy peanut sauce. Lalab fresh vegetables served with spicy sambal dipping sauce is ubiquitous in Sundanese households and eating establishments. Other Sundanese dishes include mie kocok which is a beef and egg noodle soup, and soto bandung, a beef and vegetable soup with daikon and lemongrass. A hawker favourite is kupat tahu (pressed rice, bean sprouts, and tofu with soy and peanut sauce). Colenak (roasted fermented cassava tapai with sweet coconut sauce) and ulen (roasted brick of sticky rice with peanut sauce) are dishes usually eaten warm.\n\n### Central Java\nThe food of Central Java is renowned for its sweetness, and the dish of gudeg, a curry made from jackfruit, is particularly sweet. The city of Yogyakarta is renowned for its ayam goreng (fried chicken) and klepon (green rice-flour balls with palm sugar filling). Surakarta's (Solo) specialities include nasi liwet (rice with coconut milk, unripe papaya, garlic and shallots, served with chicken or egg) and serabi (coconut milk pancakes topped with chocolate, banana or jackfruit). Other Central Javanese specialities include pecel (peanut sauce with spinach and bean sprouts), lotek (peanut sauce with vegetable and pressed rice), and opor ayam (braised chicken in coconut sauce).\n\n### East Java\nThe food of East Java is similar to that of Central Java. East Java foods tend to be less sweet and more spicier compare to the Central Javanese ones. Fish and fish/seafood products are used quite extensively, e.g. terasi (dried shrimp paste) and petis udang (shrimp paste). Some of the more popular foods are lontong kupang (tiny clams soup with rice cakes), lontong balap (bean sprouts and tofu with rice cakes), sate klopo (coconut beef satay), semanggi surabaya (marsilea leaves with spicy sweet potato sauce), pecel lele (deep fried catfish served with rice and sambal), rawon (dark beef soup). Food from Malang includes bakso malang (meatball soup with won ton and noodles) and orem-orem (pressed rice, tempe, sprouts, soy sauce, coconut, and peanuts).\n\n### Madura\nMadura is an island on the northeastern coast of Java and is administered as part of the East Java province. Like the Eastern Javanese foods which use petis udang, Madura foods add petis ikan which is made from fish instead of shrimp. The Madura style satay is probably the most popular satay variants in Indonesia. Some of its popular dishes are sate ayam Madura (chicken satay with peanut sauce), soto Madura (beef soup). There is also a mutton variant of Madura satay, Madura goat satay. Sup Kambing mutton soup is also popular in Madura. As a leading salt production center in Indonesian archipelago, Madura dishes are often saltier compared to other Eastern Javanese foods.\n\n### Bali\nBalinese cuisine dishes include lawar (chopped coconut, garlic, chilli, with pork or chicken meat and blood). Bebek betutu is duck stuffed with spices, wrapped in banana leaves and coconut husks cooked in a pit of embers. Balinese sate, known as sate lilit, is made from spiced mince pressed onto skewers which are often made from lemon grass sticks. Babi guling is a spit-roasted pig stuffed with chilli, turmeric, garlic, and ginger.\nBasa gede or basa rajang is a spice paste that is a basic ingredient in many Balinese dishes.\n\n### Batak\nBatak people use either pork or even dog to make saksang. Another Batak pork speciality is babi panggang in which the meat is boiled in vinegar and pig blood before being roasted. Another batak dish, ayam namargota, is chicken cooked in spices and blood. Another notable Batak dish is arsik, the carp fish cooked with spices and herbs. Within Batak cuisine, andaliman (Zanthoxylum acanthopodium) is often used as a spice.\n\n### Aceh\nArab, Persian, and Indian traders influenced food in Aceh although flavours have changed a lot their original forms. Amongst these are curry dishes known as kare or gulai, which are rich, coconut-based dishes traditionally made with beef, goat, fish or poultry, but are now also made with tofu, vegetables, and jackfruit. The popular Aceh food such as roti cane, mie aceh and nasi gurih.\n\n### West Sumatra\nBuffaloes are a symbol of West Sumatra and are used in rendang, a rich and spicy buffalo meat or beef dish, which is also the signature dish of Minangkabau culture. In 2017, rendang was chosen as the \"World's Most Delicious Food\" by the CNN Travel reader's choice. Padang food comes from West Sumatra, and they have perhaps the richest variants of gulai, a type of curried meat, offal, fish or vegetables. Padang favourite includes asam padeh (sour and spicy fish stew), sate Padang (Padang satay), soto Padang (Padang soto) and katupek sayua (ketupat rice dumpling in vegetable soup). Dishes from the region include nasi kapau from Bukittinggi, which is similar to Padang food but uses more vegetables. Ampiang dadiah (buffalo yogurt with palm sugar syrup, coconut flesh and rice) and bubur kampiun (Mung bean porridge with banana and rice yogurt) are other West Sumatran specialties.\nTraditionally, Minangkabau people adheres to merantau (migrating) culture, and they are avid restaurant entrepreneurs. As a result, Padang food restaurant chains can be found throughout Indonesia and neighbouring countries, likely making it the most popular regional dish in Indonesia. Outside of West Sumatra, such as in Java, most Padang Restaurants still use buffalo to make rendang, but claim it is Rendang Sapi for selling purposes, due to buffalo meat being \"inferior\" and cheaper than cow meat. Buffalo meat is harder, so it is more suitable for rendang which has a cooking time of at least 3 hours, and presents a coarser texture and a redder color compared to cow meat when it is fully cooked.\n\n### East Sumatra\nThe cuisine of east coast of Sumatra is referring to the culinary tradition of ethnic Malays of Indonesian Sumatran provinces facing Malacca strait; which includes Riau, Riau Islands, Jambi provinces and coastal North Sumatra in Melayu Deli areas in and around Medan. Because of close ethnic kinship and proximity to Malaysian Malays, many dishes are shared between the two countries. For example nasi lemak, the national dish of Malaysia, and also nasi ulam are considered native dishes in Riau and Jambi. Malay cuisine also shares many similarities with neighboring Minangkabau cuisine of West Sumatra, South Sumatra, and also Aceh; such as sharing gulai, asam pedas, pindang, kari, lemang and rendang. This is due to the fact that the Minangkabau are culturally closely related to the Malays. Tempoyak fermented durian sauce and sambal belacan are the familiar condiments in both Sumatra and Malay Peninsula. Variants of peranakan cuisine such as laksa spicy noodle and otak-otak are also can be found in Riau Islands and Medan. Seafood dishes are popular in archipelagic Riau Islands province, while fresh water fishes from Sumatran rivers, such as patin, catfish, carp and gourami are popular in Riau and Jambi. Gulai ikan patin is a signature dish of Pekanbaru, while gulai ketam (crab gulai) and nasi goreng teri Medan (Medan anchovy fried rice) are the signature dishes of Medan.\n\n### South Sumatra\nThe city of Palembang is the culinary centre of South Sumatra and is renowned for its pempek, a deep fried fish and sago dumpling that is also known as empek-empek. Pempek is served in distinctive kuah cuko, a sweet, sour and spicy sauce made from palm sugar, chili, tamarind and vinegar. Pempek derivatives dishes are tekwan soup of pempek dumpling, mushroom, vegetables, and shrimp, lenggang or pempek slices in omelette. Mie celor is a noodle dish with egg in coconut milk and dried shrimp, it is a Palembang speciality.\nThe cuisine of Palembang demonstrates various influences, from native Palembang Malay taste to Chinese and Javanese influences. Pempek is said to be influenced by Chinese fish cake akin to surimi, while the preference of mild sweetness is said to be of Javanese influence. South Sumatra is home to pindang, a sweet, sour and spicy fish soup made from soy sauce and tamarind. Pindang dishes usually uses either freshwater fishes and seafood as ingredients. Ikan brengkes is fish in a spicy durian-based sauce. Tempoyak is a sauce of shrimp paste, lime juice, chilli and fermented durian, and sambal buah is a chilli sauce made from fruit.\n\n### North Sulawesi\nManado cuisine of Minahasan people from North Sulawesi features the heavy use of meat such as pork, fowl, and seafood. Woku is a type of seafood dish with generous use of spices, often making up half the dish. The ingredients include lemongrass, lime leaves, chili peppers, spring onion, shallots, either sautéed with meat or wrapped around fish and grilled covered in banana leaves. Other ingredients such as turmeric and ginger are often added to create a version of woku. Other Minahasan signature dishes are tinutuan, chicken tuturuga, rica-rica and cakalang fufu.\nForeign colonial influence played a role in shaping Minahasan cuisine. Several cakes and pastries explicitly show Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish influences such as klappertaart and panada. Brenebon (from Dutch bruin (brown) and boon (bean)) is a pork shank bean stew spiced with nutmeg and clove. Minahasan roast pork similar to lechon in the Philippines or pig roast in Hawaii are served in special occasions, especially weddings. Other unusual and exotic meats such as dog, bat, and forest rat are regularly served in North Sulawesi region. Paniki is the bat dish of Minahasa.\n\n### Gorontalo\nThe strategic location of Gorontalo, between the Celebes Sea and Pacific Ocean in the north, and also Gulf of Tomini in the south, has made the Gorontalo region a strategic shipping route in the past. This long past history has formed the roots of a unique and distinctive culture in Gorontalo, including its unique dishes. Therefore, Gorontalo is also known as the land of spices with a unique taste of culinary.\nGorontalese cuisine known for its fresh seafood, prepared using a full-palette of spices and herbs. Home of some Gorontalese delicacies such as binte biluhuta, ayam iloni, ikan iloni, sate tuna, tabu moitomo, sate balanga, sagela, pilitode, and bilentango.\nGorontalo cuisine is also marked by a multi-cultural influence from other communities who migrated to Gorontalo, such as Arabs and Chinese culture. Moreover, Gorontalo's pastries are also famous for their sweetness and it has been influenced by European culture brought by the Dutch.\nIn 2016, the Gorontalese recipe book: \"Trailing the Taste of Gorontalo\" won as the \"Best in the World\" at the Gourmand World Cookbook Award in Yantai, China for the Asian Cuisine from Asian Books category.\n\n### South Sulawesi\nMakassar is one of the culinary centres in Indonesia. Home of some Bugis and Makassar delicacies such as Coto, Konro, Pallubasa and Mie Kering. All of these Makassar foods are usually consumed with burasa, a coconut milk rice dumpling wrapped in a banana leaf, to replace steamed rice or ketupat. As a big fish market centre, Makassar is also famous for its seafood. Various ikan bakar or grilled fish are popular and commonly served in Makassar restaurants, warung and foodstalls, such as ikan bolu bakar (grilled milkfish). Sop saudara from Pangkep and Kapurung from Palopo are also famous dishes of South Sulawesi. Another popular cuisine from Makassar is Ayam Goreng Sulawesi (Celebes fried chicken); the chicken is marinated in a traditional soy sauce for up to 24 hours before being fried into a golden colour. The dish is usually served with chicken broth, rice and special sambal (chilli sauce).\nIn addition, Makassar is also home of traditional sweet snacks such as pisang epe (pressed banana), as well as pisang ijo (green banana). Pisang Epe is a flat-grilled banana which is pressed, grilled, and covered with palm sugar sauce and sometimes eaten with durian. Many street vendors sell pisang epe, especially around the area of Losari beach. Pisang ijo is a banana covered with green colored flours, coconut milk, and syrup. Pisang ijo is sometimes served iced, and often sold and consumed as iftar to break the fast during Ramadhan.\n\n### Nusa Tenggara\nWith a drier climate in Nusa Tenggara archipelago, there is less rice and more sago, corn, cassava, and taro compared to central and western Indonesia. Fishes are popularly consumed, including sepat (Trichogaster), which is shredded fish in coconut and young-mango sauce. Lombok's sasak people enjoy spicy food such as ayam taliwang which is roasted chicken served with peanut, tomato chilli and lime dip. Pelecing is a spicy sauce used in many dishes made with chilli, shrimp paste, and tomato. A local shrimp paste called lengkare is used on the island of Lombok. Sares is made from chilli, coconut juice and banana palm pith and is sometimes mixed with meat. Non meat dishes include kelor (hot soup with vegetables), serebuk (vegetables mixed with coconut), and timun urap (cucumber with coconut, onion and garlic).\nIn East Nusa Tenggara, majority of its inhabitants are Catholics, hence pork is commonly consumed. Popular Timor dishes are Se'i smoked meat (usually pork), and katemak vegetable soup.\nThe villages of Lamalera and Lamakera have a unique dietary in which they hunt and eat whales. Although they also catch dolphins and manta rays, they prefer to hunt whales as a whale can feed the whole village for weeks. Usually they hunt Sperm whale and Orca, while some whales such as the Baleen whale is considered to be taboo to hunt.\n\n### Maluku and Papua\nThe Maluku Islands' cuisine is rich with seafood, while the native Papuan food usually consists of roasted boar with tubers such as sweet potato and taro. Various types of ikan bakar (grilled fish) or seafood are eaten with spicy colo-colo condiment. The staple food of Maluku and Papua is sago, either as a pancake or sago congee called papeda, usually eaten with yellow soup made from tuna, red snapper or other fishes spiced with turmeric, lime, and other spices.\n\n## Foreign influences\n\n\n### Indian influences\nIndian influence can be observed in Indonesia as early as the 4th century. Following the spread of Islam to Indonesia, Muslim Indian as well as Arab influences made their way into Indonesian cuisine. Andreas Maryoto, a journalist which focus on culinary history, suggests there was at least two waves of Indian culinary influence that made its way into Indonesia. The early arrival was marked by the adoption of Hindu culture that still can be seen in Java. The second wave came from the Mughal Empire, which was influenced by Islamic culture that has entered the archipelago. This second wave of Indian culinary influence can be seen throughout most of northern Sumatra, especially in Aceh and West Sumatra provinces. Examples include Indian martabak and kari (curry) that influenced the cuisines of the Acehnese, Minangkabau and the Malays of Sumatra; in addition to Betawi and coastal Javanese cuisine. Some of Acehnese and Minangkabau dishes such as roti cane, nasi biryani, roti jala, mie aceh and gulai kambing can trace its origin to Indian influences.\n\n### Arab influences\nArab Indonesians brought their legacy of Arab cuisine—originally from Hadhramaut, Hejaz and Egypt—and modified some of the dishes with the addition of Indonesian ingredients. The Arabs arrived in the Nusantara archipelago to trade and spread Islam. Nasi kebuli for example, is a popular dish among Arab Indonesian community that has made its way into mainstream Indonesian cuisine. In Maluku, kue asida served during Ramadan for iftar, is believed to be derived from the Middle Eastern asida that was introduced by Arab merchants into the Maluku Islands.\n\n### Chinese influences\nChinese immigration to Indonesia started in the 7th century, and accelerated during Dutch colonial times, thus creating the fusion of Chinese cuisine with indigenous Indonesian style. Similar Chinese-native fusion cuisine phenomena is also observable in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore as peranakan cuisine. \nMost of the Chinese influence on Indonesian cuisine hails from the Hokkien style of cooking, with other influences coming from Hakka, Teochew and Cantonese style of cooking. Some of Chinese Indonesian food retain its Hokkien name; e.g. kwetiau, bakmi, bakcang, bihun and lumpia. Some popular Indonesian dishes trace its origin to Chinese influences such as; bakso, soto mie, soto, bakpau, nasi goreng, mie goreng, tahu goreng, siomay, pempek, nasi tim, cap cai, fu yung hai and swikee. Some of this Chinese-influenced dishes has been so well-integrated into Indonesian mainstream cuisine that many Indonesian today might not recognise their Chinese-origin and considered them their own.\n\n### European influences\nThe Dutch and The Portuguese arrived in Indonesia in the 15th and the 16th century respectively in search of spices. The two colonial powers went for a century of struggle for the dominance over the archipelago, with the Dutch coming as victorious. When the Dutch East India Company (VOC) went bankrupt in 1800, Indonesia became a treasured colony of the Netherlands. Through colonialism, Europeans introduced bread, cheese, barbecued steak and pancake. Bread, butter and margarine, chocolate sprinkles, sandwiches filled with ham, cheese or fruit jam, poffertjes, pannenkoek and Dutch cheeses are commonly consumed by colonial Dutch and Indos during the colonial era. Some of native upperclass ningrat (nobles and economically well-off), and educated natives were exposed to European cuisine; This cuisine was held in high esteem as the cuisine of the upper class of Dutch East Indies society.\nThis led to adoption and fusion of European cuisine into Indonesian cuisine. Several Indonesian food can trace its origin from Dutch influence, such as kue odading that was derived from Dutch oliebollen, semur from Dutch smoor, perkedel from frikadeller,  sop senerek from erwtensoep, selat solo (solo salad) from holland biefstuk.\n\nSome dishes created during the colonial era were influenced by Dutch cuisine, including roti bakar (grilled bread), roti buaya, macaroni schotel (macaroni casserole), pastel tutup (Shepherd's pie), bistik jawa (Javanese beef steak), erten (pea soup), brenebon (kidney bean soup) and sop buntut.\nMany pastries, cakes and cookies such as kue bolu (tart), lapis legit (spekkoek), lapis Surabaya (spiku), kroket (croquette), kue bolu kenari (ontbijtkoek), and kastengel (kaasstengels or cheese sticks) are come from Dutch influence. Some recipes were invented as Dutch Indies fusion cuisine, using native ingredients but employing European pastry techniques. These include pandan cake and klappertaart (coconut tart). Kue cubit, commonly sold as a snack at schools and marketplaces, are believed to be derived from poffertjes.\nTo a lesser extent, the Portuguese have also left their mark on Indonesian cuisine, in particular the Eastern part of the country's cooking, Panada for one, is believed to be an Indonesian interpretation of the Portuguese Empanadas, while Kue pastel is also another example of an interpretation of Portuguese pastry cooking by the Indonesians, Pastel de nata is also commonly present in the country, especially in the eastern parts of the country and among the Portuguese descendants in the city of Jakarta.\n\n## Influence abroad\nConversely, Indonesian cuisine also had influenced the Dutch through their shared colonial heritage. Indonesian cuisine also influencing neighbouring countries through Indonesians migration across the straits to Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n### Malaysia\nBecause of their proximity, historic migrations and close cultural kinship, Indonesian cuisine also has influenced neighbouring cooking traditions; most notably Malaysian cuisine. Indonesian influence is pervasive in the central state of Negeri Sembilan, which was settled largely by Minangkabau people hailing from West Sumatra and is, thus, reflected in their culture, history and cuisine. Minangkabau cuisine influences is profound in Malay cooking tradition, as the result both traditions share same dishes; including rendang, gulai, asam pedas and tempoyak. Rendang is a typical example that has been well-integrated into mainstream Malaysian cuisine and is now considered their own, and popular especially during Hari Raya Aidil Fitri. In the early 20th century, there are large influx of Sumatrans to Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia heartland, that led to the popularity of Nasi Padang (originated from Padang city, West Sumatra) not only in Malaysia, but also in Singapore.\nThe Malay cuisine of southernmost state of Johor, reflects the influences of Javanese who settled there for over past two centuries. Popular Javanese-origin dishes in Johor includes ayam penyet, nasi ambeng, telur pindang, sayur lodeh, mee rebus and pechal.\n\n### Singapore\nSome dishes in Singapore are influenced by Indonesian cuisine. Satay bee hoon  has a connection to Javanese cuisine. The dish was a product of Teochew Chinese and Javanese culinary cultures. Singaporean rojak has its roots in Indonesia. In cakes and pastries, Indonesian traditional kue snacks and dessert also has influenced Singapore's kueh scene, through the migration of Anastasia Liew, a Chinese Indonesian entrepreneur, into the city state and established Bengawan Solo cake shop that has become a Singaporean signature.\n\n### Thailand\nTo a lesser extent, Indonesian cuisine also had influenced Thai cuisine — probably through Malaysian intermediary — such as the introduction of satay, from Java to Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, and reached Thailand. Achat (Thai: อาจาด pronounced [ʔāː.t͡ɕàːt]), is a Thai pickle which is believed to be derived from Indonesian acar. It is made with cucumber, red chilies, red onions or shallots, vinegar, sugar and salt. It is served as a side dish with the Thai version of satay (Thai: สะเต๊ะ).\n\n### Netherlands\nDuring the colonial period, the Dutch embraced Indonesian cuisine both at home and abroad. The Indonesian cuisine had influenced colonial Dutch and Indo people that brought Indonesian dishes back to the Netherlands due to repatriation following the independence of Indonesia.\nC. Countess van Limburg Stirum writes in her book \"The Art of Dutch Cooking\" (1962): There exist countless Indonesian dishes, some of which take hours to prepare; but a few easy ones have become so popular that they can be regarded as \"national dishes\". She then provides recipes for nasi goreng (fried rice), pisang goreng (battered, deep fried bananas), lumpia goreng (fried spring rolls), bami (fried noodles), satay (grilled skewered meat), satay sauce (peanut sauce), and sambal oelek (chilli paste).\nDutch-Indonesian fusion dishes also exist, of which the most well-known is the rijsttafel (\"rice table\"), which is an elaborate meal consisting of many (up to several dozens) small dishes (hence filling \"an entire table\"). While popular in the Netherlands, Rijsttafel is now rare in Indonesia itself. Today, there are many Indonesian restaurants in the Netherlands, especially in large cities like Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam.\n\n### Culinary diplomacy\nIndonesian cuisine traditionally enjoyed popularity in neighbouring countries; e.g. Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Australia, as well as nations that shares historical ties with Indonesia; such as the Netherlands, Suriname, East Timor and South Africa. It is also increasingly popular in Japan and Korea, as well as in Belgium and Germany through Dutch intermediary.\n\nLearning from the success of other countries culinary diplomacy, especially those of Thailand, Korea and Japan, in 2021, the Indonesian government has launched the \"Indonesia Spice Up The World\" program, which is a form of coordinated gastrodiplomacy efforts. The programme was launched to promote Indonesian cuisine abroad, to assist Indonesian culinary industry; by helping the local spice products and processed food to find their ways into the global market, and also to assist Indonesian restaurants abroad.\nThe \"Indonesia Spice Up The World\" program involves government's inter-ministerial institutions, Indonesian food industry, and also the public. The objective of the program is to boost the export value of Indonesian spices and herbs to US$2 billion, and increasing the presence of four thousand Indonesian restaurants abroad by 2024.\n\n## Meal times\nIndonesians might consume snacks or varieties of small dishes throughout the day. If separate scheduled larger meal is observed, they usually consists of sarapan or makan pagi (breakfast), makan siang (lunch) is often the main meal of the day, followed by makan malam (dinner). Mealtime is typically a casual and solitary affair, and might be observed differently across region.\nIn western and central Indonesia, the main meal is usually cooked in the late morning, and consumed around midday. In many families there is no set meal time when all members are expected to attend. For this reason, most of the dishes are made so that they can remain edible even if left on the table at room temperature for many hours. The same dishes are then re-heated for the final meal in the evening. Most meals are built around a cone-shaped pile of long-grain, highly polished rice. A meal may include a soup, salad (or more commonly vegetables sautéed with garlic), and another main dish. Whatever the meal, it is accompanied by at least one, and often several, relishes called sambals. Especially for Javanese family, on the table, it is also common to always have chips, that can be kerupuk, rempeyek, or any other chips to accompany the meal.\nIn eastern Indonesia, such as on the islands of Papua and Timor, where the climate is often much drier, the meals can be centred around other sources of carbohydrates such as sago or root vegetables and starchy tubers. Being east of the Wallace line, the biogeographic realm, and hence the flora and fauna, are quite different from those of the islands to the west, and so the food stuffs are as well.\n\n## Feasts\n\n\n### Tumpeng\nMany Indonesian traditional customs and ceremonies incorporate food and feast, one of the best examples is tumpeng. Originally from Java, tumpeng is a cone shaped mound of rice surrounded by an assortment of other dishes, officially chosen as Indonesian national dish in 2014. Traditionally featured in slametan ceremonies, the cone of rice is made by using bamboo leaves woven into a cone-shaped container. The rice itself can be plain white steamed rice, uduk (rice cooked with coconut milk), or yellow rice (rice coloured with kunyit, i.e., turmeric). After it is shaped, the rice cone is surrounded by assorted dishes, such as urap vegetables, fried chicken, semur (beef in sweet soy sauce), teri kacang (little dried fish fried with peanuts), fried prawns, telur pindang (marbleized boiled eggs), shredded omelette, tempe orek (sweet, dry fried tempeh), perkedel kentang (mashed potato fritters), perkedel jagung (corn fritters), sambal goreng ati (liver in chilli sauce), and many other dishes. Nasi tumpeng probably comes from an ancient Indonesian tradition that revers mountains as the abode of the ancestors and the gods. Rice cone is meant to symbolise the holy mountain. The feast served as some kind of thanksgiving for the abundance of harvest or any other blessings. Because of its festivities and celebratory value, even now tumpeng is sometimes used as an Indonesian counterpart to birthday cake.\n\n### Nasi Padang\nHaving Nasi Padang in festive hidang (serve) style provides opportunity to sample wide array of Padang food in a single setting. Nasi Padang (Padang-style rice) is the steamed rice served with various choices of pre-cooked dishes originated from Padang city, West Sumatra. It is a miniature banquet of meats, fish, vegetables, and spicy sambals eaten with plain white rice. It is the Minangkabau's great contribution to Indonesian cuisine.\nAfter the customers are seated, they do not have to order. The waiter with stacked plates upon their hands will immediately serves the dishes directly to the table. The table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with richly flavoured foods such as beef rendang, various gulais, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines, or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and of course, sambal. A dozen of dishes is a normal number, it could reach 14 dishes or more. Nasi Padang is an at-your-table, by-the-plate buffet. Customers take — and pay for — only what they have consumed from this array.\n\n### Rijsttafel\nAnother Indonesian feast, the Rijsttafel (from Dutch, meaning 'rice table'), demonstrates both colonial opulence and the diversity of Indonesian cuisine at the same time. The classic style rijsttafel involved serving of up to 40 different dishes by 40 male waiters, bare foot but dressed in formal white uniforms with blangkon (traditional Javanese caps) on their heads and batik cloth around their waists. In contemporary Indonesian cuisine, it has been adapted into a western style prasmanan buffet.\n\n### Prasmanan\nWhen attending the reception of an Indonesian traditional wedding party, office lunch-time meeting, a seminar or dinner gathering, one usually will find themselves queuing to Indonesian prasmanan; a long table filled with wide array of Indonesian dishes. A prasmanan is quite similar with rijsttafel but minus the ceremonial waiters and usually served fewer choices of dishes compared to its flamboyant colonial predecessor. It is an Indonesian buffet as it employs a long table with a wide range of dishes, both savoury and sweet, served on it. It can usually be found in wedding ceremonies or any other festivities. The layout for an Indonesian wedding ceremony buffet is usually: plates, eating utensils (spoon and fork), and paper napkins placed on one end, followed by rice (plain or fried), a series of Indonesian (and sometimes international) dishes, sambal and krupuk (shrimp crackers), and ending with glasses of water on the other end of the table.\n\n## Beverages\n\n\n### Non-alcoholic beverages\nThe most common and popular Indonesian drinks and beverages are teh (tea) and kopi (coffee). Indonesian households commonly serve teh manis (sweet tea) or kopi tubruk to guests. Since the colonial era of Netherlands East Indies, plantations, especially in Java, were major producers of coffee, tea and sugar. Since then hot and sweet coffee and tea beverages have been enjoyed by Indonesians. Jasmine tea is the most popular tea variety drunk in Indonesia, however recent health awareness promotions have made green tea a popular choice. Usually coffee and tea are served hot, but cold iced sweet tea is also frequently drunk. Kopi luwak is Indonesian exotic and expensive coffee beverage made from the beans of coffee berries which have been eaten by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) and other related civets. Teh botol, bottled sweet jasmine tea, is now quite popular and locally competes favourably with international bottled soda beverages such as Coca-Cola and Fanta. Kopi susu (coffee with sweetened condensed milk) is an Indonesian version of Café au lait. Es kelapa muda or young coconut ice is fresh drink which is made from chilled young coconut water, coconut flesh and syrup. It is among favourite beverage in Indonesia.\nFruit juices (jus) are very popular. Varieties include orange (jus jeruk), guava (jus jambu), mango (jus mangga), soursop (jus sirsak) and avocado (jus alpokat), the last of these being commonly served with condensed milk and chocolate syrup as a dessert-like treat. Durian can be made into ice cream called es durian.\n\nMany popular drinks are based on ice (es) and can also be classified as desserts. Typical examples include young coconut (es kelapa muda), grass jelly (es cincau), cendol (es cendol or es dawet), avocado, jackfruit and coconut with shredded ice and condensed milk (es teler), mixed ice (es campur), kidney beans (es kacang merah), musk melon (es blewah), and seaweed (es rumput laut).\nHot sweet beverages can also be found, such as bajigur and bandrek which are particularly popular in West Java. Both are coconut milk or coconut sugar (gula jawa) based hot drinks, mixed with other spices. Sekoteng, a ginger based hot drink which includes peanuts, diced bread, and pacar cina, can be found in Jakarta and West Java. Wedang jahe (hot ginger drink) and wedang ronde (a hot drink with sweet potato balls) are particularly popular in Yogyakarta, Central Java, and East Java.\n\n### Alcoholic beverages\nAs a Muslim-majority country, Indonesian Muslims share Islamic dietary laws that prohibit alcoholic beverages. Since ancient times, local alcoholic beverages were developed in the archipelago. According to a Chinese source, people of ancient Java drank wine made from palm sap called tuak (palm wine). Today tuak continues to be popular in the Batak region, North Sumatra. A traditional Batak bar serving tuak is called lapo tuak. In Solo, Central Java, ciu (a local adaptation of Chinese wine) is known. Bottled brem bali (Balinese rice wine) is popular in Bali. In Nusa Tenggara and Maluku Islands the people also drink palm wine, locally known as sopi. In the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi, the people drink a highly alcoholic drink called Cap Tikus. Indonesians developed local brands of beer, such as Bintang Beer and Anker Beer.\n\n## Eating establishment\nIn Indonesia, dishes are served from a fine dining restaurant in five-star hotel, a simple restaurant downtown, humble street side warung under the tent, to street hawker peddling their gerobak (cart) or pikulan (carrying using rod).\n\n### Restaurant and warung\nIn Indonesia rumah makan means restaurant, while warung means small and humble shop. From these eating establishments, a warteg (warung Tegal) and rumah makan Padang are particularly notable for their ubiquitousness in Indonesian cities and towns.\nA warteg or warung tegal is a more specific warung nasi, established by Javanese people from the town Tegal in Central Java. They sells favourite Javanese dishes and rice, the wide array of pre-cooked dishes are arranged in glass windowed cupboard. They are well known on selling modestly priced meals, popular among working class such as low-skilled labours in the cities. While rumah makan Padang is a Padang restaurant, a smaller scale Padang eateries might be called warung Padang.\nMost of Indonesian restaurants are based upon specific regional cuisine tradition. For example, rumah makan Padang are definitely Minangkabau cuisine. Sundanese saung restaurant or colloquially called as kuring restaurants are selling Sundanese dishes. This includes Bataks' lapo, Manado and Balinese restaurants. While other restaurants might specifically featuring their best specific dishes, for example Ayam goreng Mbok Berek, Bakmi Gajah Mada, Satay Senayan, Rawon Setan Surabaya, Pempek Pak Raden, etc.\n\n### Street food\nIndonesian street food are usually cheap, offer a great variety of food of different tastes, and can be found on every corner of the city.\nStreet and street-side vendors are common, in addition to hawkers peddling their goods on bicycles or carts. These carts are known as pedagang kaki lima. These food hawkers on carts or bicycles might be travelling on streets, approaching potential buyers through residential areas whilst announcing their presence, or stationing themselves on a packed and busy street side, setting simple seating under a small tent and waiting for customers. Many of these have their own distinctive call, tune, or noise to announce their presence. For example, bakso sellers will hit the side of a soup bowl using a spoon, whereas nasi goreng sellers announce themselves by hitting their wok.\n\nIn most cities, it is common to see Chinese dishes such as bakpao (steamed buns with sweet and savoury fillings), bakmie (noodles), and bakso (meatballs) sold by street vendors and restaurants, often adapted to become Indonesian-Chinese cuisine. One common adaptation is that pork is rarely used since the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. Other popular Indonesian street food and snacks are siomay and batagor (abbreviated from bakso tahu goreng), pempek (deep fried fish cake), bubur ayam (chicken congee), bubur kacang hijau (mung beans porridge), satay, nasi goreng (English: fried rice), soto mie (soto noodle), mie ayam (chicken noodle) and mie goreng (fried noodle), taoge goreng (mung bean sprouts and noodle salad), asinan (preserved vegetables or fruits salad), laksa, kerak telor (spicy omelette), gorengan (Indonesian assorted fritters) and bakwan (fried dish of beansprouts and batter).\nIndonesian street snacks include iced and sweet beverages, such as es cendol or es dawet, es teler, es cincau, es doger, es campur, es potong, and es puter. Indonesian cakes and cookies are often called jajanan pasar (market munchies).\n\n## Snacks\n\n\n### Kue\nIndonesia has a rich collection of snacks called kue (cakes and pastry), both savoury and sweet. Traditional kue usually made from rice flour, coconut milk, coconut sugar and mostly steamed or fried instead of baked. Traditional kue are popularly known as kue basah (\"wet kue\") that has a moist and soft texture because of rich coconut milk. The kue kering (dried kue) is local name for cookies.\nIndonesia has rich variations of kue, both native-origin or foreign-influenced. Popular ones include Bika Ambon, kue pisang, kue cubit, klepon, onde-onde, nagasari, kue pandan, lupis, lemang, lemper, lontong, tahu isi, getuk, risoles, pastel, lumpia, bakpia, lapis legit, soes, poffertjes and bolu kukus.\n\n### Traditional crackers\nTraditional crackers are called krupuk, made from bits of shrimp, fish, vegetables or nuts, which are usually consumed as a crunchy snack or to accompany main meals. These crispy snacks sometimes are added upon the main meal to provide crunchy texture; several Indonesian dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, ketoprak, lontong sayur, nasi uduk, asinan and bubur ayam are known to require specific type of krupuk as toppings. There are wide variations of krupuk available across Indonesia. The most popular ones would be krupuk udang (prawn crackers) and krupuk kampung or krupuk putih (cassava crackers).\nOther popular types include krupuk kulit (dried buffalo-skin crackers), emping melinjo (gnetum gnemon crackers), and kripik (chips or crisps), such as kripik pisang (banana chips) and keripik singkong (Cassava chips), rempeyek, is a flour-based cracker with brittle of peanuts, anchovies or shrimp bound by crispy flour cracker, rengginang or intip (Javanese) is rice cracker made from sun-dried and deep fried leftover rice.\n\n## Fruits\nIndonesian markets abound with many types of tropical fruit. These are an important part of the Indonesian diet, either eaten freshly, or made into juices (such as jus alpukat), desserts (such as es buah and es teler), processed in savoury and spicy dishes like rujak, fried like pisang goreng (fried banana), cooked into cakes (such as kue pisang or bika ambon), sweetened and preserved such as sale pisang and manisan buah, or processed into kripik (crispy chips) as snacks like jackfruit or banana chips.\nMany of these tropical fruits such as mangga (mango), manggis (mangosteen), rambutan, cempedak, nangka (jackfruit), durian, jambu air, duku (langsat), jeruk bali (pomelo), belimbing (carambola), kedondong and pisang (banana), are indigenous to Indonesian archipelago; while others have been imported from other tropical countries, although the origin of many of these fruits might be disputed. Klengkeng (longan) were introduced from India, semangka (watermelon) from Africa, kesemek from China, while alpukat (avocado), sawo, markisa (passionfruit), sirsak (soursop), nanas (pineapple), jambu biji (guava) and pepaya (papaya) were introduced from the Americas. Many of these tropical fruits are seasonally available, according to each species flowering and fruiting seasons. While certain fruits such as banana, watermelon, pineapple and papaya are available all year round.\nToday, Indonesian markets is also enrichen with selections of home-grown non-tropical fruits that is not native to Indonesia. Strawberry, melon, apple, pear and dragonfruit are introduced and grown in cooler Indonesian highlands such as Malang in mountainous East Java, Puncak and Lembang near Bandung, to mimic their native subtropics habitat.\n\nIn the last few years, fruit chips have been more and more various. In the old times, banana and jackfruit chips were the most common, but now Indonesian fruit chips are also made from strawberry, apple, dragonfruit, pepino, watermelon, melon, more. Malang, a city in East Java, is the centre of fruit chip production aside from tempeh chips.\nBanana and coconut are particularly important, not only to Indonesian cuisine, but also in other uses, such as timber, bedding, roofing, oil, plates and packaging. Banana leaf and janur (young coconut leaf) are particularly important for packaging and cooking process, employed to make pepes, lontong and ketupat.\n\n## Health\n\n\n### Nutrition\nMuch carbohydrate intake in Indonesian cuisine comes from rice, while in eastern parts of Indonesia, yam and sago are common. Indonesian protein intake comes from soy bean products that are processed into tofu and tempeh. Chicken eggs, poultry and meats are also consumed. Most of the fat intake comes from cooking oil (coconut oil) of fried dishes, coconut milk, peanuts, as well as meats and offals.\nSome Indonesian fruit and vegetable dishes such as fruit rujak, gado-gado, karedok, pecel, lalab, capcay, tofu and tempeh are foods with low fat and high fibre. Tempeh, for example, is a vegetarian substitute for meat. Some dishes, especially gorengan (deep-fried fritters) and those dishes infused or caramelised with coconut milk, such as rendang and gulai, might taste succulent but are rich in saturated fat.\n\n### Food safety\nThe authentic traditional Indonesian home cooking is freshly made and consumed daily with minimal or no processed, canned or preserved foods, which means there is a minimal amount of preservatives and sodium. Most ingredients are bought fresh very early in the morning from local traditional markets, cooked around the late morning and consumed mainly for lunch. The leftovers are stored in the cupboard or on the table covered with tudung saji (weaved bamboo food cover to protect the food from insects or other animals), all in room temperature to be heated and consumed again for dinner. Traditionally, Indonesian dishes are rarely stored for long periods of time, thus most of these dishes are cooked and consumed in the same day. Some exceptions apply to dried, salted, and processed food. For example, dry rendang may still be safe to consume for several days. Modern refrigeration technology is available in most households.\n\n### Hygiene\nWhile most of Indonesian grocery products and food served in mid to upperscale eating establishments maintain food hygiene standard ranges from good to acceptable — regulated and supervised by Badan Pengawasan Obat dan Makanan (Indonesian Food and Drug Administration) — some warung traditional foodstalls and street vendors might have poor hygiene. The tropical microbes also might contribute to food poisoning cases mostly gastroenteritis, especially among foreigners during their stay in Indonesia. It is advisable to drink bottled or boiled drinking water, or choose cooked hot food instead of uncooked room temperatured ones sold by street vendors.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\nOwen, Sri. \"Indonesian Food and Cookery\" ISBN 978-0907325000, Prospect Books, 1980.\nOwen, Sri. \"Sri Owen's Indonesian Food\" ISBN 978-1910496718, Pavilion Books, 2015.\nWongso, William. \"Flavors of Indonesia: William Wongso's Culinary Wonders\", ISBN 978-9798926327 Bab Publishing, 2016.\nFord, Eleanor. \"Fire Islands: Recipes from Indonesia\", ISBN 978-1911632047 Murdoch Books, 2019.\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Iranian cuisine\n\nIranian cuisine comprises the culinary traditions of Iran. Due to the historically common usage of the term \"Persia\" to refer to Iran in the Western world, it is alternatively known as Persian cuisine, despite Persians being only one of a multitude of Iranian ethnic groups who have contributed to Iran's culinary traditions.\nIran has a rich variety of traditional dishes, and has influenced many other cuisines over the ages, among them Caucasian cuisine, Central Asian cuisine, Greek cuisine, Levantine cuisine, Mesopotamian cuisine, Russian cuisine and Turkish cuisine.

Characteristic Iranian spices and flavourings such as saffron, cardamom, and dried lime and other sources of sour flavoring, cinnamon, turmeric and parsley are mixed and used in various dishes.\nOutside of Iran, Iranian cuisine can be found in cities with significant Iranian diaspora populations, namely London, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Washington metropolitan area, Vancouver, Toronto, Houston and especially Los Angeles and its environs.\n\n## History\nAmong the writings available from the Middle Persian scripts, the treatise of Khosrow and Ridag, points about stews and foods and the way of using them and how they are obtained in the Sassanid period are found as valid references in compiling the history of cooking in Iran. The names of many of the Iranian dishes and culinary terms that have been translated can be seen in Arabic language books. Naturally the customs and habits of the Arabs influenced the Iranians, specifically in the Abbasid period.\nAncient Persian philosophers and physicians have influenced the preparation of Iranian foods to follow the rules of the strengthening and weakening characteristics of foods based on the Iranian traditional medicine.\n\n## Historical Iranian cookbooks\nAlthough the Arabic cookbooks (e.g. Kitab al-Tabikh) written under the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate—one of the Arab caliphates which ruled Iran after the Muslim invasion—include some recipes with Iranian names, the earliest surviving classical cookbooks in Persian are two volumes from the Safavid period. The older one is entitled \"Manual on cooking and its craft\" (Kār-nāmeh dar bāb e tabbāxī va sanat e ān) written in 927/1521 for an aristocratic patron at the end of the reign of Ismail I. The book originally contained 26 chapters, listed by the author in his introduction, but chapters 23 through 26 are missing from the surviving manuscript. The recipes include measurements for ingredients—often detailed directions for the preparation of dishes, including the types of utensils and pots to be used—and instructions for decorating and serving them. In general, the ingredients and their combinations in various recipes do not differ significantly from those in use today. The large quantities specified, as well as the generous use of such luxury ingredients as saffron, suggest that these dishes were prepared for large aristocratic households, even though in his introduction, the author claimed to have written it \"for the benefit of the nobility, as well as the public.\"\nThe second surviving Safavid cookbook, entitled \"The substance of life, a treatise on the art of cooking\" (Māddat al-ḥayāt, resāla dar ʿelm e ṭabbāxī), was written about 76 years later by a chef for Abbas I. The introduction of that book includes elaborate praise of God, the prophets, the imams, and the shah, as well as a definition of a master chef. It is followed by six chapters on the preparation of various dishes: four on rice dishes, one on qalya, and one on āsh. The measurements and directions are not as detailed as in the earlier book. The information provided is about dishes prepared at the royal court, including references to a few that had been created or improved by the shahs themselves. Other contemporary cooks and their specialties are also mentioned.\n\n## Staple foods\n\n\n### Rice\nThe usage of rice, at first a specialty of the Safavid Empire's court cuisine, evolved by the end of the 16th century CE into a major branch of Iranian cookery. Traditionally, rice was most prevalent as a major staple item in northern Iran and the homes of the wealthy, while bread was the dominant staple in the rest of the country.\nVarieties of rice in Iran include gerde, domsia (literally meaning black-tail, because it is black at one end), champa, doodi (smoked rice), Lenjan (from Lenjan County), Tarom (from Tarom County), and anbarbu.\nThe following table includes three primary methods of cooking rice in Iran.\n\n### Bread\nSecond only to rice is the production and use of wheat. The following table lists several forms of flatbread and pastry bread commonly used in Iranian cuisine.\n\n### Fruits and vegetables\nThe agriculture of Iran produces many fruits and vegetables. Thus, a bowl of fresh fruit is common on Iranian tables, and vegetables are standard side dishes in most meals. These are not only enjoyed fresh and ripe as desserts but are also combined with meat as accompaniments to main dishes. When fresh fruits are not available, a large variety of dried fruits such as dates, figs, apricots, plums and peaches are served instead. Southern Iran is one of the world's major date producers, where some special cultivars such as the Bam date are grown.\nVegetables such as pumpkins, spinach, green beans, fava beans, courgette, varieties of squash, onion, garlic and carrot are commonly used in Iranian dishes. Tomatoes, cucumbers and scallion often accompany a meal. While the eggplant is \"the potato of Iran\", Iranians are fond of fresh green salads dressed with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, chili powder, and garlic powder.\nFruit dolma is probably a specialty of Iranian cuisine. The fruit is first cooked, then stuffed with meat, seasonings, and sometimes tomato sauce. The dolma is then simmered in meat broth or ascallions sweet-and-sour sauce.\nVerjuice, a highly acidic juice made by pressing unripe grapes or other sour fruit, is used in various Iranian dishes. It is mainly used within soup and stew dishes, but also to simmer a type of squash dolma. Unripe grapes are also used whole in some dishes such as khoresh-e ghooreh (lamb stew with sour grapes). As a spice, verjuice powder (pudr-e ghooreh) is sometimes reinforced by verjuice and then dried.\n\n## Typical spices\nAdvieh or chāshni refers to a wide variety of pungent vegetables and dried fruits that are used in Iranian cuisine to flavor food.\nOne of the traditional and most widespread Iranian spices is saffron, derived from the flower of Crocus sativus. Rose water, a flavored water made by steeping rose petals in water, is also a traditional and common ingredient in many Iranian dishes.\nPersian hogweed (golpar), which grows wild in the humid mountainous regions of Iran, is used as a spice in various Iranian soups and stews. It is also mixed with vinegar into which broad beans are dipped before eating.\nSome other common spices are cardamom, made from the seeds of several Elettaria and Amomum plants; shevid, an annual herb in the celery family Apiaceae; mahleb, an aromatic spice made from the seeds of Prunus mahaleb; and limu amani, dried lime.\nThere are also several traditional combinations of spices, two of which are arde (tahini), made from toasted ground hulled sesame seeds, and delal sauce, made of heavily salted fresh herbs such as cilantro and parsley.\n\n## Typical food and drinks\nTypical Iranian cuisine includes a wide variety of dishes, including several forms of kebab, stew, soup, and pilaf dishes, as well as various salads, desserts, pastries, and drinks.\n\n### Main course\n\n\n### Appetizers\n\n\n### Desserts\nIn 400 BC, the ancient Iranians invented a special chilled food, made of rose water and vermicelli, which was served to royalty in summertime. The ice was mixed with saffron, fruits, and various other flavors. Today, one of the most famous Iranian desserts in the semi-frozen noodle dessert known as faloodeh, which has its roots in the city of Shiraz, a former capital of the country. Bastani e zaferani, Persian for \"saffron ice cream\", is a traditional Iranian ice cream which is also commonly referred to as \"the traditional ice cream\". Other typical Iranian desserts include several forms of rice, wheat and dairy desserts.\nThe following is a list of several Iranian desserts.\n\n### Snacks\nCookies appear to have their origins in 7th-century Iran, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. There are numerous traditional native and adopted types of snack food in modern Iran, of which some are listed within the following table.\n\n### Drinks\nIran is one of the world's major tea producers, mostly cultivated in its northern regions. In Iranian culture, tea (čāy) is widely consumed and is typically the first thing offered to a guest. Iranians traditionally put a lump of sugar cube in the mouth before drinking the tea. Rock candies are also widely used, typically flavored with saffron.\n\nIran's traditional coffee (qahve, or kāfe) is served strong, sweet, and \"booby-trapped with a sediment of grounds\". In 16th-century Safavid Iran, coffee was initially used for medical purposes among the society. Traditional coffeehouses were popular gatherings, in which people drank coffee, smoked tobacco, and recited poetry—especially the epic poems of Shahnameh. In present-day Iran, cafés are trendy mostly in urban areas, where a variety of brews and desserts are served. Turkish coffee is also popular in Iran, more specifically among Iranian Azeris.\nWine (mey) has also a significant presence in Iranian culture. Shirazi wine is Iran's historically most famous wine production, originating from the city of Shiraz. By the 9th century, the city of Shiraz had already established a reputation for producing the finest wine in the world, and was Iran's wine capital. Since the 1979 Revolution, alcoholic beverages have been prohibited in Iran; though non-Muslim recognized minorities (i.e. Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians) are allowed to produce alcoholic beverages for their own use. While non-alcoholic beer (ābjow) is available from legal outlets, other citizens prepare their alcoholic beverages illegally through the minority groups and largely from Iraqi Kurdistan and Turkey.\nAraq sagi, literally meaning \"doggy distillate\", is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage in Iran which contains at least 65% pure ethanol. It is usually produced at homes from raisins, and is similar to Turkish rakı. Prior to the 1979 Revolution, it had been produced traditionally in several cities of Iran. Since it was outlawed following the 1979 Revolution, it has become a black market and underground business.\nThe following table lists several Iranian cold beverages.\n\n## Regional Iranian cuisine\n\n\n### Iranian Azerbaijani cuisine\nThe Iranian Azerbaijani people, living primarily in the region of Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran, have a number of local dishes that include Bonab kabab (بوناب کاباب), the dumpling dish of joshpara (جوُشپَرا), an offal-based dish named jaqul baqul typically containing liver and heart, a variation of qeyme called pichagh (پیچاق‌قیمه), and a variation of kufte called Tabriz meatballs. The pastry shekerbura (شَکَربورا) is identical to Khorasan's shekarpare (šekarpāre). The food tastes noticeably Iranian, though also with its own unique features, such as using more lemon juice and butter than other groups of Iranians.\n\n### Balochi cuisine\nMeat and dates are the main ingredients in the cuisine of Iran's southeastern region of Baluchistan. Rice is primarily cultivated in the region of Makran. Foods specific to Baluchistan include tanurche (tarōnča; tanurče), a local variety of grilled meat prepared in a tanur; doogh-pa (dōq-pâ), a type of khoresh that contains doogh; and tabahag (tabâhag), meat prepared with pomegranate powder. Baluchi cuisine also includes several date-based dishes, as well as various types of bread.\n\n### Caspian cuisine\nThe southern coast of the Caspian Sea, which consists of the Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazanderan, Alborz, and Golestan, has a fertile environment that is also reflected in its cuisine. Kateh is a method of cooking rice that originates from this region. This type of rice dish is also eaten there as a breakfast meal, either heated with milk and jam or cold with cheese and garlic. Caviar fish roes also hail from this region, and are typically served with eggs in frittatas and omelettes or eaten simply with lavash and butter. Fish is commonly eaten in the Gilan province, where Caspian kutum is a staple and usually served fried along with rice. Smoked fish (Persian: ماهی دودی, Romanized: Mahi doodi) is also popular in Gilan and usually incorporated into rice by steaming the two together. Local cookies (koluče) of the region are popular desert items, particularly those from the region of Fuman. Another notable dessert from this region is Reshteh khoshkar (Persian: رشته‌خشکار), consisting of fried rice flour dough filled with sugar and nuts. Medlar is also commonly eaten in Gilan and locally referred to as \"konos\" (Persian: کونوس).\n\n### Kurdish cuisine\nThe region of Kurdistan in western Iran is home to a variety of local āsh, pilaf, and stew dishes. Some local Kurdish dishes include a traditional grilled rib meat that is called dande kabāb, a type of khoresh made of chives that is called xoreš-e tare, and a dish of rice and potatoes that is called sib polow.\n\n### Southern Iranian cuisine\nThe food of southern Iran is typically spicy. Mahyawa is a tangy sauce made of fermented fish in this region. Being a coastal region, Khuzestan's cuisine includes especially seafood, as well as some unique local beverages. In southern Khuzestan, there is also a variation of kufte that is known as kibbeh and is made of ground meat, cracked wheat, different types of herbs and vegetables and various spices.\n\n### Turkmen cuisine\nIran's Turkmen people are predominantly centered in the Iranian provinces of Golestan and North Khorasan. Chegderme (čekderme) is a Turkmen dish made of rice, meat, and tomato paste.\n\n## Structure\n\n\n### Meals\n\n\n### Traditional table setting and etiquette\nTraditional Iranian table setting firstly involves the tablecloth, called sofre, and is spread out over either a table or a rug. Main dishes are concentrated in the middle, surrounded by smaller dishes containing appetizers, condiments, and side dishes, all of which are nearest to the diners. When the food is perfectly served, an invitation is made to seat at the sofre and start having the meal.\nIn Persian culture, guests are considered divine and so are served first and abundantly so, the host serving themselves last. Taarof, the Persian art of etiquette, dictates that guests do not help themselves to any food or drink unless offered to do so, and even having been offered must decline until having received at least a third offer, lest they appear greedy. This demonstration of restraint and good manners is met with the generosity of the host, who will insist on multiple servings for their guests. In certain circles, it may be considered polite to leave a tiny amount of food or drink behind, lest the host interpret an empty plate or cup as suggestive of the meagreness of their hospitality.\n\n## See also\nList of Iranian foods\nMazanderani cuisine\nKurdish cuisine\nAzerbaijani cuisine\nNimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi, a medieval Indian Persian-language cookbook\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\n\nDaniel, Elton L.; Mahdi, Ali Akbar (2006).

Rastafari dishes are referred to as ital, meaning \"natural\", derived from the English word \"vital\". Their diet is based on maintaining a balanced life, good health and longevity by consuming fresh, organic and locally sourced ingredients. Popular ital foods include ackee, lentil, tofu, okra and bean and pea dishes, pumpkin rice, callaloo and other vegetables. Some Rastas adhere to a pescatarian diet, and have adopted kosher dishes.

In Canada, Jamaican restaurants can be found in the Toronto metropolitan area, as well as Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa.\nGolden Krust Caribbean Bakery & Grill is a chain of about 120 franchised restaurants found throughout the U.S., which sells Jamaican patties, buns, breads, and other popular Jamaican dishes. They also supply food to several institutions in New York. Juicy Patties, one of Jamaica's first patty companies to be established, has also expanded to other regions.\n\n## Other cuisines in Jamaica\nInternational cuisines have been introduced and blended with Jamaican cuisine,\ndue to waves of migration from other parts of the world, tourism, the growth of the restaurant and hotel industries, the establishment of businesses (including eateries) by foreigners in Jamaica, and the exposure of locals and the diaspora, particularly Jamaican chefs, to international gastronomy and culinary practices. As such, other cuisines like Latin, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Italian, Greek, French, Spanish, Mediterranean and American cuisines can be found in Jamaica. It is common to find fusion restaurants across the island offering blends of Jamaican foods and beverages with dishes from other cuisines. An array of fusion dishes are created on the island, especially in eateries and hotels, like Jamaican-style tacos, tapas, soul food, pastas, pizzas, calzone (called \"pizza patty\"), tostadas, paninis, burgers, quesadillas, salads, crêpes, waffles, frittatas, cocktails, desserts and a variety of international epicurean dishes.\n\n## See also\nCaribbean cuisine\nItal\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Cuisine of Jamaica at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Kaak (bread)\n\nKaak (Balochi, Urdu, Pashto: کاک) is a kind of bread and a native dish of Baloch and Pashtun peoples. Kaak is cooked on ghargi (steamed stone). In the past, Kaak was a tradition in all Pashtun regions,  but now people sometimes cook this traditional Pashtun dish for taste.\nPopular among the nomadic  Kaak is usually very hard once it has been baked. Hence, it is also sometimes called Pathar Ki Roti  (Urdu: پتھر کی روٹی,, lit. 'bread of stone').\n\n## Preparation\nThe dough for the bread is prepared with a mixture of flour, dry yeast, sugar, salt, milk, water and other ingredients based on the variation. The dough is then flattened and rolled over a preheated stone. Sometimes sesame seeds are added as a complement. The stone is then baked in a tannur until the bread is fully cooked. Although the dough starts out thin and limp, it expands and hardens greatly during the baking process. Kaak is often served with sajji.\n\n## Traditions\nIn Baloch tradition, the matriarch of the home has the most say in how the kaak is prepared. Once the bread rises the responsibilities of the task are handed over to the younger women of the household to finish the job.\nIt is also customary among the Balochi people, that the father of the bride feeds his daughter kaak the night before her wedding.\n\n## Festivities\nDuring the summer seasons, a popular baker's festival is held in the town of Mahore called Khabaz Mahrajan Magiz. The festival highlights the best bakers from across the entire Pakistan, thus drawing very large crowds into the tens of thousands. It is customary at this festival to have an annual kaak competition, in which all the bakers submit their goods to a panel of judges. The winners of this competition, which include gold, silver, and bronze medalists, have the privilege to showcase their finest kaak at the grand opening ceremony for the festival the following year. The winner is chosen based on the flavor, size And color of their Ka’ak.\n\n## In other cultures\nIn some Arab countries, ka'ak refers to a thin savoury pastry round, similar in shape to a bagel. These are often flavoured slightly with mahleb and covered with white sesame seeds. Kaak bi loz is a sweet version made with ground almonds.\n\n\n== References ==",

Wazwan dishes apart from in wedding along with rice, some vegetables and salad are prepared also on special occasions like Eids.\n\n## Global Popularity and Urban Expansion\nKashmiri cuisine has witnessed a notable rise in global appreciation, with iconic dishes such as Rogan Josh, Gushtaba, Yakhni, and Kahwa being featured in gourmet menus worldwide. From food festivals in London and Dubai to fine-dining experiences in New York and Toronto, the rich, aromatic flavours of Kashmir are being embraced by international audiences.\nWithin India, Kashmiri culinary offerings are increasingly making their mark in major metropolitan cities. Upscale Kashmiri restaurants have opened in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, catering to both the diaspora and curious food lovers seeking authentic regional cuisine. These establishments, often run by members of the Kashmiri community or curated by chefs specialising in Wazwan, are helping preserve and promote the unique gastronomic heritage of the region.\nThis growth is further supported by food influencers, YouTube chefs, and curated pop-up events that showcase the intricate preparation and cultural significance of Kashmiri dishes.\n\n## History of Kashmiri cuisine\nFrom the Mahabharata to the Iranian invasion of Kashmir (which was a part of Gandhara) by Darius in 516 BC, to the Mauryans who established Srinagara to the Kushan Empire to the invasion of Kashmir by Timur in 1398, the culture and cuisine of Kashmiris are linked to South Asia, Persian and Central Asian cuisines mixed with local innovations and availabilities of ingredients. The term kabab is Arabic in origin, korma has Turkish roots, and rogan josh, yakhaen, ab gosht, riste and goshtabh stem from Persian sources.\n\n### Early history\nThere is a legend that aeons ago Kashmir valley was a vast mountain lake. The soil contains remains of fresh-water fish and fossil-oysters and the black shells of water chestnut may be found in layers embedded in the earth at a height of 457 metres above the level of the valley.\n\n### Paleolithic age\nThe process of Kashmir's amalgamation with outer world commenced with the importation of primitive forms of snake and fire worship from Iran. Since Paleolithic times, serpents were worshipped and buried with a supply of insects in their graves as a provision for their future life. In addition, they splashed grains at shrines and graves to express regard unto snakes and other animals. Bommai Sopore archaeological site, discovered by Dr Mamtaz Yatoo in 2005, has a prehistoric rock engraving, the first of its kind found in Kashmir. This Upper Paleolithic engraving depicts chase and game engagements of the prehistoric population. Recent investigations by archaeologists  at Overa valley of Pahalgam have revealed stone tools of Paleolithic ages, including single-edged stone blades used for preying of animals.\n\n### Neolithic culture\nEven before the Megalithic culture that followed the Neolithic period, there is evidence of wheat, barley and lentil cultivation. Clear evidence for agriculture in the form of large domestic storages of grain and rachises of wheat and barley, as well as millets, were found after 2500 BC in Qasim Bagh in Kashmir. The Kashmir Valley contains multiple sites of the so-called Northern Neolithic, possibly dating as early as 3000 BC when climate became warmer. Excavations from Pethpuran Teng suggest a wider network of contact of this early population, and a significantly deeper time transition of broom-corn millets across the Inner Asian mountains. The date range returned from the lentil samples at Pethpuran Tang represent one of the earliest dated pulse crops from the region (c. 2700 BC). While the valley is altitudinally comparable to other inter-montane agro-pastoralist sites in Central Asia, Kashmir's slightly lower latitude presented the valley as a geographic threshold where crops could be grown without the necessary introgression of traits allowing their cultivation in higher and more northerly regions.\nThe range of tools recovered at the Neolithic site of Burzahom, in the district of Srinagar shows the men were skilled hunters with knowledge of implements for cultivation. Stone hearths have been found at ground levels, near the mouth of pits. The Period II (Ceramic Neolithic) structures show a dish with a hollow stand and a globular pot. Rectangular harvesters with a curved cutting edge have also been recovered. Presence of harpoons indicates fishing. The art-producing behaviour of Neolithic men is witnessed in a hunting scene, with human, a dog and a sun path diagram. Mortar and pestle characterised by a rectangular cross-section are made of the same volcanic rock as used by the current Kashmiris. The presence of lentil explains that the people of Burzahom had wide contacts with Central Asia. Harvesters (both in stone and bone) with two holes for handling it indicate contacts with China.\nAt the Gufkral Neolithic site 41 km southwest of Srinagar, archaeologists have confirmed settlers were engaged in wild game as well as domestication of animals. The animals that were known at the time were wild sheep, wild goat, wild cattle, red deer, wolf, Himalayan Ibex and bear. Roasting of food (both flesh and grain) was done only outside as no hearths or fireplaces were found inside the dwelling pits. Piercers were used for making incisions and for tearing open the flesh after the animal was killed and skinned, scrapers were used to scrape fat from the flesh. In the Phase IB of Neolithic occupation, some new additions included cattle and common peas. Pig (sus scrofa) and fish made their appearance in the late Neolithic period. Bones of hare (lepus), hedgehog, rodents and beaver were also recovered.\nOn the basis of the presence of emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) at Kanispur, seven kilometres east of Baramulla, contact of Harappans with the Neolithic Kashmir has been suggested. With the Aryan migration to Kashmir around the 8th century BC, the fire worship cult got embedded into the innate religio-cultural texture of Kashmir through practices such as a phallic emblem of cooked rice. The local ceremony of vayuk is again near to the Iranian style of Farvadin. On a special day of the month, Kashmiri Muslims remember their dead, visit their graves and distribute loaves of rice.\n\n### Indo-Greek and Kushana period\nEarthen thalis (pans) have been found at Semthan, north of Bijbehara from the Indo-Greek period (200 BC – 1st century AD). Handis (metal pots), flat plates, pedestalled cups and edged bowls have been reported in large numbers from the excavated sites of Harwan, Kanispur and Semthan. At Kanispur, cooking pots have been found. Kushan coins have been recovered in large numbers from the Kashmir valley with those of Kanishka continuing to emulate Vima's motif of king sacrificing at an altar.\nThe Kushan period is characterised by a double-cropping pattern, suggesting a change in agricultural practices associated with a population recovery following a post-Neolithic decline. Finds of Vitis vinifera (Common Grape Vine), Emblica officinalis (Indian Gooseberry), Ziziphus nummularia (Wild Jujube), Juglans regia (English Walnut) and Prunus amygdalus (Almond) suggest that horticulture and foraging played an important role in the diet of the occupants. The Kushan remains from Kanispur are dominated by barley, in contrast to Semthan where wheat is more common.\nThe Kushana history tells us that right from the days of the Kushana rulers (1st century AD – 450 AD) there were contacts between Romans and Kashmir. Kashmir was connected to the southern silk route via Gilgit and Yasin valley at Tashkurghan. The main items of export to Rome were saffron and dolomiaea costus (kutha). Dolomiaea costus was used in Rome for various purposes, among which for scenting of food and seasoning of wine.\n\n### Hindu dynasties\nThere were military contacts between the Karkota kingdom in Kashmir and the Tang (618 AD – 907 AD) court in China. When the Chinese Tang Dynasty successfully defeated the Tibetan forces and entered little Palur in October 722 AD, Kashmir was credited for providing agricultural supplies essential to sustaining the Chinese troops stationed in Gilgit valley.\n\n### Kashmir Sultanate (1346 – 1580s)\nSince Islam did not directly arrive from Arabia to Kashmir, it naturally carried with it mixed Iranian and Central Asian influences. Similarly, the Kashmiri Hindus were doing things which would have frightened orthodox Hindus from India. They drank water brought by a Muslim, ate food that was cooked in a Muslim boat and even Muslim foster-mothers were allowed to feed their children. Hence, the rishi cult identified with Hinduism in subscribing to vegetarianism, non-injury to animals and abstaining from the use of garlic and onion in food. Nund Rishi, according to a legend, subsisted on a diet of dried dandelion leaves and Lal Ded preached and practised strict vegetarianism.\nMoreover, when Yusuf Shah Chak, the last sovereign king of Kashmir signed a treaty with emperor Akbar recognising his symbolic sovereignty in 1586 one of the terms was that the mint, the saffron and game would remain under imperial control.\n\n### Mughals (1580s – 1750s)\nIn Srinagar, poor people's meals were made of ghee, milk, beef, onions, wine, pickles, and vinegar. Rice, fish, and numerous vegetables were staple foods during the Mughal era. Butter and fats were not widely used in cooking since they were believed to be dangerous owing to the cold environment. The river water was not drunk by the people of South Kashmir. They drank Dal Lake water, which was warm, pleasant, and easily digestible.\nIn 1635–36, during Shahjahan's reign, a violent conflict flared up between the Shias and Sunnis when a group of both the sections were eating mulberries at Maisuma and some were accused of using indecent words against Muhammad. In 1641, unprecedented floods followed by a famine rendered the villages desolate. Shahjahan sent 30,000 rupees to the subedar Tarbiyat Khan to be distributed among the destitute in Srinagar and also ordered that five centres should be opened in the valley to provide free food to the needy.\n\n### Sikh Rule (1819–1846)\nCow slaughter was declared a crime punishable by death and many people accused of killing cows were publicly hanged. Owing to the shortsighted policy of the rulers Kashmír witnessed an acute agrarian crisis. Sikh rulers imposed one half of the paddy production as a share of the government. The population of Kashmir decreased from 800,000 in 1822–1823 to 120,000 in 1835.\n\n### Dogra Rule (1846–1947)\nCoarse rice and haakh constituted the main food. Where paddy cultivation was restricted due to uneven terrain and lack of irrigation facilities, wheat and maize constituted the main items of food. In certain parts of Kashmir they lived on aquatic products such as singhara (water nuts).\nKashmiri apples were carried by coolies on their backs over 12 days to Rawalpindi in British India.\nThe famine of 1878–79 was deadly. Also, catching and eating of fish by men driven by hunger was made unlawful by an edict during the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. Often anyone who killed a cow was boiled in oil and the hung from a hook which was fixed on to a pole in a public place. People did not possess any right to waste land and the only right which the villager had was that he could plant trees on such lands, and was the owner of the trees and not of land. Milk and butter was often taken away from gujjars (nomadic herdsmen) without payment by the officials.\n\n## Ingredients and seasoning\n\n\n### Meat\nApart from chicken, fish and game, Kashmiris use only mutton (meat of mature sheep) or goat's meat. More than 75% of sheep population are cross breeds and are generally called Kashmir Merino that provides the dual purpose of meat and wool. The Bakkarwal (nomadic herders) goats belong to the rare Kaghani breed, prized as one of the world's best in terms of meat.\nBeef is consumed in towns and villages of Kashmir more so for its affordability. In some villages, beef-eaters are huddled separately from those supposed to be served mutton during wazwan feasts. There is a class divide between people who eat kat maaz (\"small meat\", mutton) considered elite and more sophisticated, and those who eat bad maaz (\"big meat\", beef), considered lower-class. The biggest rabbit breeding farm in North India sprawls on six hectares of land in Wussan village of Baramulla district of Kashmir.> The consumption of rabbit meat as a substitute for sheep and goat meat among the general masses is becoming popular. People with cardiac problems eat rabbits as the meat is considered lean and white with high nutritious value.\nThe local geese of Kashmir (Kashmir Aenz) is the first and only recognised domestic geese breed in India. Goose rearing in the Valley dates back to ancient times as has been mentioned by Sir Walter R. Lawrence in his book 'The Valley of Kashmir'. In Srinagar, geese are mainly sold in Batmaloo and Lal Chowk, by vendors, who purchase geese from rearers in villages and sell them live or slaughtered in the city. In affluent families, geese pickles are made and kept aside for winter use.\n\n### Fish\nThe Duke of Bedford helped to send 10,000 trout eggs from the UK in 1899 but they perished on the way. A second consignment arrived from Scotland the next year. The rainbow and brown trout adapted well to the Kashmir valley, while the indigenous snow trout continues to flourish. Locally known as alegaad, it can be found in both standing and flowing water bodies throughout the valley. There were 137 private fish farms in just Anantnag district, which was declared as the 'Trout District of India'.\n\n### Eggs\nPoultry farms are set on European standards, as Kashmir has similar geo-climatic conditions. Using permaculture and no-dig gardening technique, free-range eggs are being sold every day. People collect chick varieties like Kalinga brown, Vanraja, Kashmir Commercial Layer, etc. to dish out a regular supply of organic brown eggs. The Kashmir Duck (batook) is reared for its eggs in all districts of the valley with highest population in Bandipora district, followed by Kupwara, Barmulla, Srinagar and others. Eggs of Kashmir duck are either white or green-shelled and weigh 66.20 g on average.\nKalij pheasant (wan kokur) lays between 6 and 10 eggs per clutch, and are perfect served soft-boiled in their olive-green shells with a mere sprinkle of celery salt and buttered soldiers.\n\n### Cereals\nPeople in Kashmir eat different varieties of rice including the nutty and fragrant Mushk Budji, grown in the higher reaches of the Kashmir valley. In February 2022, Mushk Budji rice got the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. This cooked rice is unique and possesses a harmonious blend of taste, aroma and rich organoleptic properties. Kashmiri red rice, locally called Zaag Batt, is grown in a small village called Tangdhar on the border with Pakistan. The small unpolished grains are sought for their superior texture and taste. In 2009, farmers in the region harvested the legendary Basmati rice for the first time.\n\n### Vegetables\nThe most important and frequently used Kashmiri vegetables are: haakh (collard greens or kale), monj Haak ( kohlrabi), tsochael(mallow), bamchoont (quince), kral mound (shepherds purse), saze posh (holly hock), nadur (lotus stem), praan (shallots), aubuj (sorrel), mawal (cockscomb), wushkofur (camphor), tila gogul (mustard) and gor (water-chestnut). The floating vegetable garden on the Dal Lake is the second largest wholesale market in the world. Men, young and old, on their wooden boats, argue about the price of plump pumpkins and gourds as they share cigarettes or hookahs. The water of Kashmir is sweeter, and that affects the taste and flavour of vegetables. The items for sale include tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, turnips, water chestnuts, leafy vegetables, and the famous nadur. A porous and fibrous lake vegetable, nadur has grown to become an irreplaceable ingredient in a traditional Kashmiri kitchen. Local accounts date its discovery to the 15th-century sultan Zain-ul-Abidin, who was introduced to the chewy delicacy while on a shikara ride on the Gil Sar lake located in the exteriors of Srinagar. Also, according to a popular legend, the yarn threads that Lalla Ded (1320–1392), the Kashmiri mystic saint wove were thrown into the Dal Lake when her tyrant mother-in-law ridiculed and taunted her for yarning it too thin. These got changed into the fibres of nadur for eternity.\nSun-dried vegetables, locally known as hokh syun, are consumed as fresh produce dwindles. During summer, vegetables are peeled, chopped, salted and sun-dried to preserve them for winter. The various varieties of hokh syun include dried tomatoes (ruwangun haech), dried fenugreek leaves (meeth), dried lotus stem (nadir haech), dried Iberian knapweed (kretch), dried shallot leaves (praan), dried mint (pudna), dried bottle gourd (al haech), dried turnip slices (gogji haech), dried quince (bamchount haech), dried collard greens (hoech haak) and dried spinach (hoech palak). In the Charar Sharief area of central Kashmir, dried pears, locally known as tang haech are considered a delicacy.\nShallots, known as praan, stand out, lending its unique flavour to a multitude of Kashmiri dishes, from soups and stews, to curries and kebabs. Many of Mughal Emperor Akbar's feasts in the 16th century featured shallots. Buthoo village has earned renown for producing prized organic shallots. Snow Mountain garlic, also known as Kashmiri garlic, is a rare single-clove variety of Allium sativum. The clove beneath is bright white to creamy-white color and offers a strong, pungent garlic flavour without the acidity present in other varieties.\nKashmir valley is the only place in India where asparagus grows. Until the 1960s, it was grown widely in Kashmir at Pulwama, Budgam, Rajbagh, Tangmarg and Gulmarg. As of now the area of asparagus cultivation is restricted to Tangmarg and Gulmarg.\n\n### Sugar and sweeteners\nSugarcane does not grow in Kashmir. Sugar was exclusively imported from erstwhile united Punjab up to 1947 but was among the costliest imports to Kashmir. The then Dogra government suggested cultivating sugar maple and beetroot sugar but it could not materialise. In the past, when sugar was not imported, people used honey. Sidr honey considered one of the most distinguished types of honey in the world, is obtained from Sidr (jujube) trees in the Kashmir Valley.\n\n### Fruits\nKashmiri apples are known for their juiciness and flavour. In 2019 alone, Kashmir produced over 1.9 million metric tonnes of apples, the highest among Indian states. Further, Kashmir accounts for 90% of India's walnut production. Kashmiri walnuts are a great source of nutrients and widely in demand across the globe. Giant walnut trees can scale 75 feet in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. Many years ago, walnut oil used to be a medium of cooking and imparted a sweeter and nuttier flavour to dishes.\n\nMuhammad Quli Afshar brought cherries from Kabul and planted them during Akbar's time. Mishri variety of cherry is famous in Kashmir and sweeter than other varieties. They are loaded with minerals, vitamins and plant compounds. The exotic berries from Kashmir are sweet and sour mulberry (tuell and shah-tuell), raspberry (chhanchh), barberry (kaawducchh) and red berry (haapat maewaa). Gassu area on the Srinagar outskirts is known for strawberry (istaber) harvesting.\nOrange cultivation for commercial purposes was introduced a few decades before in the Urossa village in Uri. The climate and soil is relatively warmer than the rest of Kashmir and conducive for the crop. In this mountainous region, the micro-climate is good for Mediterranean crops like lemons and olives. The lemons are better and juicier than Punjab lemons. A sub-species of wild olives that doesn't bear much fruit but grows even in hardy, rough conditions is used for grafting with fruit varieties, producing about 1,000 litres of extra virgin olive oil each year.\nAccording to official estimates, Kashmiri grapes are cultivated on almost 500 to 600 hectares of land with production up to 1100 to 1500 MT per year.\n\n### Dairy products\nHolstein Friesian and Jersey cows were introduced in Kashmir several decades ago, producing 4 million litres of milk per day. Organic Kashmiri butter wrapped in Chinar leaves was common in the yesteryears, but is now sold only by a few. A traditionally ripened Himalayan cheese is called the milk chapati or maish krej in Kashmiri.\n\n### Spices\nKashmiri saffron is known for its aroma, colour, and medicinal value. The saffron of Pampore town is considered to be of superior quality with 8.72% crocin content as compared to the Iranian variety which contains 6.82%. In May 2020, Kashmiri saffron was given a geographical indication tag. The spice shahi zeera or imperial cumin or black cumin belongs to Apiaceae (parsley) family and was initially available in the jungles of Gurez Valley. These darker seeds unlike the regular brown zeera are of superior quality because of their smell, relative rarity and shape.\nAmong the spices used, Kashmiri chilli pepper (martswangun) — chilies are grown locally in Kashmir. When they turn red, they are dried and ground into powder form. Powdered red chilies are moderately hot colouring agents that are used for most meat and some vegetarian dishes. The taste varies with the region they are being cultivated, from areas such as Bugam, Tangmarg, Bandipora, Dangerpora, Anantnag and Noorbagh. Chillies of Bugam are the most bitter in taste, while Noorbagh chillies have less seeds and are spicier than the ones grown in other areas. The local government has sought a geographical indication tag for chillies cultivated in Srinagar and Budgam districts.\nRock salt consumption is quite old in Kashmir. It is imported from Khewrah area of Pakistani Punjab, where it was first discovered by the troops of Alexander the Great in 326 B.C. Pre-independence, rock salt was imported via Mughal Road, which, before the advent of Mughals, was called Namak Route. After partition, its supply was barred. Because of its benefits, it is now being consumed by almost one-fourth of the population.\n\n## Specialties by season\nSpring is often considered a season of rejuvenation after a long and harsh winter. Picnics, of which the Kashmiris are very fond, are planned around the theme of food. The countryside is awash with white and pink flowers of almond (badaam), peach (tsunun) and cherry (gilaas) blossoms. The mustard fields join the show with their bright-yellow blooms. The pear (tang) blossoms can be identified by their thick cluster of flowers. Apricot (Tser) blossoms are white in colour, often tinged with a pink or reddish hue. They grow from late spring through early summer. Beans are a spring vegetable. Cherries are a fruit of late spring and summer. Coriander (danival) is a cool herb whose season predominates between spring and summer in cooler areas. Garlic (rohan) is found mainly in spring and through fall season. Melons (kharbooz) are a fruit grown in spring and summer. Tender spring-time haakh (collard greens) are called kaanul.\n\nThe season of harvesting lotus stem (nadur) starts in September. The samovar bubbles in a corner, spreading the sweet fragrance of saffron and cardamom in the air. Cookie-shaped kandi kulchas made of flour, butter, sugar and sprinkled with poppy seeds are passed around to be dipped into the tea and relished. Men fish under the shade of the chinar tree in Dalgate area. Dandelion leaves, also known as haand in Kashmir, are foraged on foot. Going to the countryside, one can see paddy being cut with sickles and then stacked in huge piles to dry. Chestnuts are roasted in the dying embers. Bulbous garlic and red potatoes jostle for space. Saffron fields in full bloom greet you in Pampore, a part of Pulwama district. Going towards the hilly areas one can see the maize and walnut trees with their fruit getting ready to be harvested. Going towards the apple producing areas of Sopore in North Kashmir or Shopian in South Kashmir, one can see cartons of apple being transported to various parts of the country.\nDuring the long winters the days are short, sunlight and electricity in short supply, so there is not much that can liven up existence except interesting food, so it constitutes a major interest of the Kashmiris' lives. On window sills and terraces, one can spot small piles of aubergines, cherry tomatoes, gourds and turnips being sun-dried. There is ample time and the daan (Kashmiri traditional stove) with its twin stoves (Chaer in Kashmiri) ignited by fire wood placed in one inlet) is always ready to oblige long hours of cooking despite the shortages of electricity. When all village roads remained blocked due to heavy snowfall and villagers have to use oil lamps or kerosene lanterns, the entire family is called to the kitchen where flavour of the overnight shab deg fills the entire space. Kohlrabi (monje) is cold tolerant, and continues to grow on the fields in winter, so much that a little frost even helps it.\n\n## List of dishes\n\n\n## Beverages\n\n\n### Noon Chai or Sheer Chai\nKashmiris are heavy tea drinkers. Kashmiris don't use the word \"Kashmiri Chai\". The word \"Noon\" in Kashmiri means salt. The most popular drink is a pinkish coloured salted tea called \"noon chai\". It is made with black tea, milk, salt and bicarbonate of soda. The particular colour of the tea is a result of its unique method of preparation and the addition of soda. The Kashmiri Hindus more commonly refer to this chai as \"Sheer Chai.\" The Kashmiri Muslims refer to it as \"Noon Chai\" or \"Namkeen Chai\", both meaning salty tea. Noon Chai or Sheer Chai is a common breakfast tea in Kashmiri households and is taken with breads like baqerkhani brought fresh from Qandur (Kashmiri : کاندر ) or bakers. It is one of the most basic and essential food items in a Kashmiri household. Tea was as served in large samavars. Now, the use of Samavars is limited to special occasions and normally kettles are used. Nuts like almonds and pistachios and edible rose petals can be added before serving, and sometimes malai or fresh cream is added to give the tea viscosity and richness.\n\n### Natural mineral water\nAccording to a 2022 study by the University of Kashmir, 87% of springs in Kashmir valley have excellent to good water quality. A large part of the society, particularly those living in rural and backward areas, depends on spring water. Most villagers believe spring water is the purest form of water due to a spiritual connection with the shrines.\n\n### Other drinks\nBabribyol sharbat is a concoction of sweetened milk, rose water or Rooh Afza syrup, and soaked sweet basil seeds that are grown locally.\nMade from yoghurt or kefir, Kashmiri lassi (lyaess) is a liquid, salty way to drink up yoghurt. The process of churning the buttermilk with a wooden choomph or churner is rhythmic and there is an art involved. The yoghurt has to be churned the right way, the buttery fats have to float to the top in a nice froth, the spices and dried mint leaves have to be just right.\nSadr-e-kaenz is a fermented rice water drink is supposed to be very good for a sluggish liver.\nShahi Sheera is made by extracting the juice of different berries, it is prepared at home during Ramadan. It features in 1977 Kashmiri film Arnimaal where guests are sipping on the beverage during wedding festivities.\n\n## Food and beverage pairings\nThe traditional Kashmiri wazwan, which comprises slow-cooked meat dishes is a wonderful pairing that enhances the spicy notes of whisky. The Loire Valley wine Sancerre goes well with Kashmiri goshtabeh. A ripe fruity red works well with the full bodied roghan josh. A recommended wine to try with is Montepulciano.\n\n## Special occasions and festivals\n\n\n### Eid-ul-Fitr\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims avoid consuming food during the day. The menu for Ramadan month includes khajur ka laddoo (date balls), babribyol (basil seeds), kulfi, phirin, seemni, fruit chaat, fruit custard, kateer (a drink loaded with health benefits) and noon chai. The smell of slow-cooked mutton hovers, fragrant and sultry in the air, and despite the familiar air of unpredictability in Srinagar, spirits are high and streets are filled with happy greetings of Eid Mubarak.\nEid-ul-Fitr marks the end of 30 days of Ramadan. After attending Eid prayers at a mosque or Eidgah, families return home to welcome guests. A common tradition on Eid morning is serving Kehwa (saffron tea) and chai (milk tea), accompanied by an assortment of bakery items such as cakes, cookies, ghee tchot (a tandoor-baked flatbread), pastries, and savoury snacks like chicken and mutton patties.\nWell-to-do families often prepare select Wazwan dishes, including kebabs, rista (meatballs in gravy), shami kebabs, and chicken pieces. Other delicacies like kanti (stir-fried meat), mutton or chicken tikki are served with sauces and green chutney (dhaniya chutney), especially when entertaining special guests like sons-in-law.\nFor lunch, rice is the staple, served with a variety of homemade dishes, almost all featuring meat. A notable preparation is yakhni, a traditional dish made with fresh curd and mild spices, offering a rich yet subtle flavor.\n\n### Eid-ul-Adha\nThe day begins with the Fajr (dawn) prayer and a breakfast of bakery goods with dodh kehwa (milky green tea). As the festival draws to a close, most well-to-do families start placing orders with the wazas for the feast, which is cooked by chefs at their own places and then sold to the customers for serving at their homes. Sacrificial animals include Delhi Walla, Merino Cross, Bakerwal and Kashmiri varieties of sheep.\n\n### Other festivals\nFor the Urs of Hazrat Sheikh Dawood, only vegetarian food is supplied to devotees. Majority of people in Batmaloo and adjoining areas turn vegetarian and do not eat meat or chicken. They widely consume dried turnips (gogji aare) because it is believed, during Dawood's time, sundried turnips helped Kashmir survive a famine.\nFor the Urs of Dastageer Sahab in Khanyar and Sarai Bala areas of Srinagar, the devotees are seen outside the shrines where local and non-local business establishments install their carts and are seen selling the Kashmiri traditional food stuff. Pious men sing hearty hymns over offerings of dates and sweets.\nFor the Urs of Raeshmol Saheb, people in Anantnag district in southern Kashmir quit eating meat as a mark of respect for the 16th century mystic. Rarely is a butcher shop open during these seven days. For three-and-a-half days each before and after the saint's Urs, people eat radish braised in tamarind.\nFor Herath's Kashmiri Pandits, the prasad offering at Shivratri puja is a charger piled high with rice, cooked lamb and fish, and a luscious raw fish in its entirety atop the pile.\nOn the 9th day of the month of ashad, Har Navum, Pandits in Kashmir offer the deity Sharika yellow rice cooked with turmeric, a little oil and salt along with tsarvan (goat's liver).\nThe festival of Navreh, the Kashmiri New Year, is incomplete without nadur. A celebration often confused with the Nowruz of the Persians and Persianate cultures, Navreh is the welcoming of spring in the Northern hemisphere, and its date fluctuate, but always around to the March equinox.\n\n## Diaspora and fusion cuisines\nTibetan exiles in Kashmir, including members of Tibet's small Muslim population live in Srinagar, mainly in a small area near the 18th-century Hari Parbat fort. Popular momo (beef dumplings) shops and Tibetan restaurants are run by their children. Tibetan options include Cantonese chicken and kumloo wonton, fried pasta stuffed with minced mushrooms.\nKashmiri Sikh cuisine has a bit of influence from Punjab with onions and tomatoes, but the flavouring goes the Kashmiri way with elements such as badyaan (saunf). A large number of Indian tourists depend entirely on Vaishno Dhabas, the Valley's generic non-A/C restaurants that serve all-vegetarian North Indian fare.\n\n## Cooking methods\nSome Kashmiri cooking techniques are:\nThe stalks of dandelion (haand) with their spiky-edged leaves have to blanched four times so that they bear no bitterness.\nTraditional Kashmir food receives heat on two sides, top and bottom and the best results are obtained by slow heat using charcoal.\nThe leaves of Kashmiri haakh are braised in lots of water. It is very important to ensure that the haakh stays submerged underwater during the initial cooking process using a wooden spatula or large spoon to continuously push the greens down. Mustard oil, which is used extensively in Kashmiri cuisine, imparts an extra flavour to the dish.\n\nMuch of Kashmiri cooking relies on a fragrant meat stock or court-bouillon. The main skill of a wazwan lies in the preparation of this stock made of onions and shallots. Freshly shaped meatballs (rista and goshtabeh) are poached in this lamb stock flavoured with cinnamon and black cardamom, and simmered.\nWhole spices must be tempered, fried in oil – clove, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves. Fried too little, and the dish will be lifeless, without fragrance. A second too much, and one will be left with nothing but bitterness. Hot ghee or mustard oil is poured on top and garnished with fried praan (shallots) paste & saffron extract.\nSliced onions are caramelised, fried until golden brown and pureed with minimal water.\nYoghurt must be a fatty, thick emulsion. Dried mint, just a pinch, is added right at the end to freshen the dish.\nSome dishes are enhanced in colour by saffron extract (rogan josh and rista) or mawal (dried cockscomb flower). Kashmiri chilli is also added in excess sometimes to produce a red colour. Tomato is incorrectly used as a substitute when mawal and rattanjot are not available. No authentic version cooked in Kashmir has tomatoes.\nThe food gets its flavours and textures from the spices being simmered, slow cooked with ingredients until they let out their inherent juices and fats and melt together.\nSmoking mustard oil is a treatment known as durust, and gets it ready to use after cooling off.\nIn dum cooking, the cooking vessel in the shab deg is sealed with dough before being cooked over a simmering fire through the long winter night. Dum cooking was made popular by the Mughal courts around the 16th century.\nGoshtabeh and rista, the two meatball dishes are rarely found outside the valley because their unique tenderised texture is enormously challenging. The sheep has to be freshly slaughtered and the meat pounded before rigor mortis sets. To incorporate air to make them light and fluffy, the meat undergoes a process of being folded while beaten.\nThe quality of pots is important, according to wosta (ustad) or chef Nazir Ahmed Aram. He says they must have the right content of copper. Using wood (walnut and apple are the best) is important too. Cooking on gas is not the same.\n\n## Etiquette of Kashmiri dining\nKashmiris are gregarious and like to share. Language and Food are the two vital parts of the region's identity. 'One who eats properly shall rule the country' it is said. An interesting wedding tradition from Kashmir involves newlyweds making roti together. While the bride flattens the dough and puts it on the griddle, the groom is responsible for flipping it and making sure it is cooked. Kashmiris are very particular about the taste of dishes. Food connoisseurs can easily taste a single morsel and name the waza (chef) who cooked it. They can smell an aubergine from four other kinds, and tell you which one is from Kashmir. When filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri wrote a presumptuous tweet proposing the idea of vegetarian wazwan, social media erupted in spontaneous protest. Also, Gordon Ramsay, multi-Michelin-starred chef and television personality, found himself at the receiving end of criticism for his Rogan Josh by Kashmiris who commented that the cut of the meat and the gravy were wrong.\n\nIn Kashmir, it is said that food should both taste and look good. Its aroma must be appetising. Success of a meal lies in its appeal to the eyes, nose and then the tongue. Any event, from a minor one such as receiving a guest in one's home, to a major one such as a circumcision or a wedding, becomes a celebration of preparing, laying out, serving and consuming together the most delicious victuals. Delicacies are passed on to neighbours to be relished and there is no shame in asking for something when the nostrils are tickled and tempted by the mouth-watering smells from a neighbour's kitchen.\nGiant dastarkhaans (white sheets) are spread on the floor on which the meal is served. However humble or lofty the fare on it, the dastarkhaan has always been the center of warm hospitality and conviviality. In big Kashmiri dinners, a hundred to five hundred people are usually invited. Since insurgency and the resultant violence and bloodshed, food has come to hold even greater meaning as each meal signifies a celebration of life itself. It is worth mentioning that wazas (the descendants of Samarkandi cooks), whose shops are located in particular areas of the city of Srinagar, form a significant political group in Kashmir.\nAll dishes are eaten by hand as Kashmiris believe in an intimate relationship with food. Kashmiris consider it disrespectful if one refuses food varieties or an extra helping. They can go great lengths to persuade, swearing to die if you refuse an extra serving!\n\n## Food-related proverbs\nKashmiri language is rich in food-related proverbs and idioms.\n\n## Sustainable consumption\nKashmiri women would previously take extra mutton dishes by packing them in old newspapers or plastic bags that they would carry. With time, this tradition became popular, and men soon began travelling with the remaining mutton on their traem (wazwan copper dish). In Kashmir, taking leftover food into carrying bags evolved into a movement, and people also granted it social legitimacy. Even the elites have joined the cause and begun providing specially made carry bags of leftover food. Even the leftover rice is not wasted in marriage functions and is served to animals (dogs, cattle etc.).\nIn Kashmir, a now-abandoned practice used green Chinar leaves in packaging delicate things like mulberry, butter, mutton and cheese. This helped these easily contaminable items to stay fresh till consumption.\n\n## See also\nKanger\nList of topics on the land and the people of Jammu and Kashmir\nDogra cuisine, from the Jammu region of Kashmir\nBalti (food), associated with the Baltistan region of Kashmir\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n\"Chor Bizarre\".

    "text": "# Kebab\n\nKebab (UK:  kib-AB, US:  kib-AHB), kebap, kabob (alternative North American spelling), kebob, or kabab (Hindi and Kashmiri spelling) is a variety of roasted meat dishes that originated in the Middle East.\nKebabs consist of cut-up meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab. The traditional meat for kebabs is most often lamb meat, but regional recipes may include beef, goat, chicken, fish, or even pork (depending on whether or not there are specific religious prohibitions).\n\n## Etymology\nThe word kebab has ancient origins. It was popularized in the West by Turks to refer to a range of grilled and broiled meat, which may be cooked on skewers, including stews, meatballs, and many other forms.\nThe word kebab likely came to English in the late 17th century from Arabic: كَبَاب kabāb, partly via kabāb (कबाब / کباب) Hindi-Urdu and Persian, as well as kebap Turkish. The Turkish Language Association states the same, that it is from Arabic: كَبَاب kabāb, while according to linguist Sevan Nişanyan, the Turkish word kebap is also derived from the Persian word kabāb, meaning roasted meat. It appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th century, in Kyssa-i Yusuf (lit. 'the story of Joseph'), though still in the Persian form. Nişanyan states that the word has the equivalent meaning of 'frying, burning' with kabābu in the old Akkadian language, and kbabā כבבא in Aramaic. In contrast, food historian Gil Marks says that the medieval Arabic and Turkish terms were adopted from the Persian kabab, which probably derived from the Aramaic.\nThe American Heritage Dictionary also gives a probable East Semitic root origin with the meaning of 'burn', 'char', or 'roast', from the Aramaic and Akkadian. The Babylonian Talmud instructs that Temple offerings not be kabbaba (burned). These words point to an origin in the prehistoric Proto-Afroasiatic language: *kab-, to burn or roast.\n\n## History\nWhile the word kebab or shish kebab may sometimes be used in English as a culinary term that refers to any type of small chunks of meat cooked on a skewer, kebab is mainly associated with a diversity of meat dishes that originated in Persia and Anatolia.\nIn Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's 10th-century Baghdadi cookbook Kitab al-Tabikh (Arabic: كتاب الطبيخ), a compendium of much of the legacy of Mesopotamian, Persian, and Arab cuisines, there are descriptions of kabāb as cut-up meat, either fried in a pan or grilled over a fire.\nThis cuisine has spread around the world, in parallel with Muslim influence. According to Ibn Battuta, a Maghrebi traveller, kebab was served in the royal houses during the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526), and even commoners would enjoy it for breakfast with naan. Kebab dishes have been adopted and integrated with local cooking styles and innovations, from the now-ubiquitous doner kebab fast food, to the many variations of shish kebab, such as the satays of Southeast Asia.\n\n## Varieties by region\nIn most English-speaking countries, a kebab may be the classic shish kebab or souvlaki – small cubes of meat cooked on a skewer – or made with minced (ground) meat, as in doner kebab. By contrast, in Indian English, Bangladeshi English, Pakistani English and in the languages of the Middle East, other parts of Asia, and the Muslim world, a kebab is any of a wide variety of grilled meat dishes. Some dishes ultimately derived from Middle Eastern kebab may have different names in their local languages, such as the Chinese chuan.\n\n### East Asia\n\n\n### Europe\n\n\n### West Asia and North Africa\n\n\n### South Asia\nSouth Asia has a rich kebab tradition with a great variety of different kebab dishes. Many modern kebabs in Indian subcontinental cuisine (Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani cuisine) trace their origins back to the time of the Mughals and the strong influence of Mughlai cuisine in medieval India, that persists to this day. Kebab dishes common to one or more of these countries include:\n\nTandoori kebab (Urdu: تندوری کباب, Hindi: तंदूरी कबाब)\nNaga doner kebab\nKathi Kebab (including Porota Kababs, kebab wraps)\nShami kebab (Urdu: شامی کباب, Hindi: शमी कबाब) – A Shami kebab is a small patty of minced beef or chicken and ground chickpeas and spices.\nSeekh kebab (Urdu: سيخ کباب. Hindi: सीख़ कबाब) – A long skewer of beef mixed with herbs and seasonings, it takes its name from the skewer.\nTunde ke kabab (Urdu: ٹنڈے کے کباب, Hindi: टुंडे के कबाब) – Tunde ke kebab, also known as Galouti kebab, is a small patty of minced beef or chicken native to the Awadh region of India.\nBun kebab (Urdu: بن کباب, Hindi: बन कबाब) – A unique kebab sandwich with beef, lamb, fish or chicken.\nChapli kebab (Urdu: چپلی کباب, Hindi: चपली कबाब) – A spiced, tangy round kebab made of ground beef and cooked in animal fat. A speciality of Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and now found across the Indian subcontinent.\nBihari kebab (Urdu: بہاری کباب, Hindi: बिहारी कबाब) – Skewer of beef mixed with herbs and seasoning native to the Bihar region of India.\nKalmi kebab (Urdu: کلمی کباب, Hindi: कलमी कबाब)\nSheesh kebab (Urdu: شیش کباب, Hindi: शीश कबाब)\nBurrah kebab – made from goat or lamb chops, liberally marinated with spices and charcoal grilled.\nEaten in the Indian subcontinent, the tikkia is a related food, though these are often made from potatoes (known as aaloo).\n\n### Southeast Asia\nSatay is a kebab of seasoned, skewered, and grilled meat, served with a sauce. It is a dish of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.\nSatay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, lamb, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu. Traditionally skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond are used, although bamboo skewers are often used instead. It is grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire with spicy seasonings. It may be served with various sauces, though most often a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce.\nSatay was developed by Javanese street vendors as a unique adaptation of Indian kebab. The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as tongseng and gulai kambing based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of Indian and Arab traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century. It is available almost anywhere in Indonesia, where it has become a national dish. In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.\n\n### Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n\n## Other variants\n\n\n### Ćevapi\nĆevapi (pronounced [tɕɛv̞ǎːpi]) or ćevapčići (formal diminutive, [tɕɛv̞ǎptʃitɕi], ћевапчићи), which comes from the word kebab, is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of skinless sausage, found traditionally in the countries of southeastern Europe (the Balkans). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and are also common in Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Slovenia, as well as in North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania. Ćevapi has its origins in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Ottoman period, and represents a regional speciality similar to the kofte kebab. A dish with similar origins is in Romania called mititei.\n\n### Pinchitos\nPinchitos or Pinchos Morunos is a Moorish-derived kebab dish in Spanish cuisine. The name pinchitos is used in the southern Spanish autonomous communities of Andalusia and Extremadura. They consist of small cubes of meat threaded onto a skewer (Spanish: pincho) which are traditionally cooked over charcoal braziers. Similar dishes in North Africa or other Muslim majority countries tend to be lamb-based, but pork and chicken are the most popular meats for the dish in Spain. Pinchitos are also extremely popular in Venezuela, due to the heavy influence Spain had in Venezuelan cuisine during many years.\n\n### Shashlik\nShashlik is similar to, or sometimes a synonym for, shish kebab. It is popular in many countries, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus, and the Baltics. In non-Muslim-majority countries, shashlik and equivalent dishes like Romanian frigărui may sometimes be prepared with pork.\n\n### Vegetarian kebab\nA vegetarian kebab is a kebab made without meat. It can be made with several meat alternatives, including soya protein and cheese.\n\n## Kebab in Western culture\nKebab cuisine has spread around the world together with Muslim influence. Although non-Muslim Westerners may be increasingly familiar with some of the many other international kebab dishes, only two have become an established and widely popular part of the culture in many Western countries. In English, the word kebab commonly refers to shish kebab and, outside of North America, to döner kebab or related fast-food dishes. These dishes are also served in many other countries, where they may have different names.\nKebabs have also met opposition: in Italy, several cities banned kebab shops in order to preserve Italian culinary culture. Many protested against these bans as \"racist\". Kebabs have also been invoked in anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially in online contexts, such as the \"remove kebab\" slogan.\n\n### Shish kebab\nIn English, kebab, or in North America also kabob, often occurring as shish kebab, is now a culinary term for small pieces of meat cooked on a skewer. The word kebab, most likely derived from Persian, has been used with various spellings in this sense since at least the 17th century, while the Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest known publication of the term shish kebab, derived from Turkish: şiş kebap, in 1914.\nThere are two etymologies suggested for Shish Kabob in the Persian dictionary of Dehkhoda: Shish being the Persian word \"Shish\" for the number 6, which refers to the original six pieces of meat of a standard Kabob skewer, or \"Shish\" being driven from Late Middle Persian \"Sich\" meaning a skewer. The word \"Kabob\" is most probably driven from the Arhameic word kbābā (to roast).\nIn many English-speaking countries, it refers to the now well-known dish prepared with marinated meat or seafood together with vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers threaded onto the skewer, also sometimes known as shashlik. This preparation is different from the typical Turkish shish kebab style, where vegetables are usually cooked on a separate skewer. Shish kebabs are customarily prepared in homes and restaurants, and are usually cooked on a grill or barbecue, or roasted in an oven.\nThe word kebab may also be used as a general term in English to describe any similar-looking skewered food, such as brochette, satay, souvlaki, yakitori, or numerous small chunks of any type of food served on a stick. This is different from its use in the West Asia, where shish (Persian/Mazandarani: شیش, Turkish: şiş) is the word for skewer, while kebab comes from the word for grilling.\n\n### Doner kebab\nEnglish speakers from countries outside North America may also use the word kebab generally to mean the popular fast food version of the Turkish döner kebab, or the related shawarma or gyros, and the sandwiches made with them, available from kebab shops as take-away meals. This usage may be found in some non-English parts of Europe as well. In North America, the Greek variant gyros is most widely known.\nThe döner kebab originated in 19th century Turkey, but it became widely popular in the West only in the latter half of the 20th century. Many layers of meat are stacked onto a large vertical rotating spit; the outer surface is gradually cooked and sliced off, and typically served either mixed or topped with vegetables and sauces in a sandwich made with pita or other flatbreads. Certain regional variants also include cheeses. Sandwiches served in the same manner, but with other meats or cheese, may also sometimes be called a \"kebab\". It is available in most parts of Europe, and many other countries, though sometimes with different names or serving styles. In Germany, the highly popular sandwich, introduced by Turkish immigrants, is called a Döner, though Arab shops there serve shawarma.\n\n## Similar dishes\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Culture of Kenya\n\nThe culture of Kenya consists of multiple traditions and trends without a single prominent culture identifying the country. Kenyan cultural heritage and modern expressions of culture instead consist of various cultures, shaped and practiced by the country's different communities.\nHowever, a different scholarly opinion from Prof. Olubayi Olubayi of Kenya states that \"a distinct national culture of Kenya has emerged and continues to grow stronger as it simultaneously borrows from, reorganizes, and lends to, the 50 ancient ethnic cultures of Kenya. The emerging national culture of Kenya has several strong dimensions that include the rise of a national language, the full acceptance of Kenyan as an identity, the success of a postcolonial constitutional order, the transition from ecumenical religions, the urban dominance of multiethnic cultural productions, and increased national cohesion\".\n\n## History\nKenyan culture has evolved over time, in the course of Bantu and Nilotic immigrations, conduction of trade by the Swahili people and independence for struggles against British rule.\n\n## Specifics\nThe largest subsaharan ethnic groups are the Bantu, especially the Kikuyu, and the Nilotic peoples, especially the Kalenjin, each with unique cultural traits. The other native subsaharan Africans, the Cushites, may geopolitically self-identify as East African, but culture-wise increasingly also consider themselves as Horners. In addition, the small minority of Kenyans with Eurasian heritage mainly hail from northwestern parts of India, Oman and the British aristocracy.\n\n## Cuisine\nThere is no singular dish that represents all of Kenya's wide cuisine. Different communities have their own native foods. Staples are maize and other cereals depending on the region, including millet and sorghum eaten with various meats and vegetables. The foods that are universally eaten in Kenya are ugali, sukuma wiki, and nyama choma. Kenya's coastal cuisine is unique and highly regarded throughout the country.\nSukuma wiki, a Swahili phrase which literally means \"to push the week\", is a simple dish made with greens similar to kale or collards that can also be made with cassava leaves, sweet potato leaves, or pumpkin leaves. Its Swahili name comes from the fact that it is typically eaten to \"get through the week\" or \"stretch the week\".\nNyama choma is grilled meat, which can be considered as an unofficial national dish—usually goat or sheep—while kuku choma is grilled chicken. It is usually cooked over an open fire. It is usually eaten with ugali and kachumbari, maharagwe (bean stew) and mchicha (shredded spinach). It is served as a traditional meal on Christmas Day.\nAmong the Luhya residing in the western region of the country, ingokho (chicken) with ugali is a favorite meal. Other than these, they also eat tsisaka, miroo, managu and other dishes.\nIn the Rift Valley, the Kalenjin have long made mursik, which they have with kimyet (ugali) and vegetable relishes such as isageek and \"socheek\". Also among the Kikuyu of Central Kenya, many tubers, including ngwaci (sweet potatoes), ndũma (taro root, known in Kenya as arrowroot), ikwa (yams), and mianga (cassava) are eaten, as well as legumes like beans and a Kikuyu bean known as njahi.\nAmong the Luo residing on the western region around Lake Victoria, kuon (ugali) and rech (fish) is a favourite, as well as gweno (chicken), aliya\" (sun-dried meat), onyoso (type of ant), ng'wen (termitoidae), dede (grasshoppers), various birds and green vegetables; alode such as osuga, akeyo, muto, dodo, dek, apoth and bo, are all consumed with ugali.\nAround the country, distinct differences may be noted based on what foods are locally available in each area. Grains are a staple food for groups that grow grains (such as the Kikuyu, Embu, Meru, and Kisii). Other communities such as the Luo and the Coastal community have fish and seafood for their staple food as these are available in such areas. In semi-arid areas like Turkana, foods made from sorghum are more common staple foods.\nTowards the city, foods eaten by working families vary according to preference and ethnicity. Rice and stew are more common with working families, as are other dishes like chapati, a staple that originated from India (similar to the flatbread paratha), and chicken stew.\n\n## National dress\nApart from its national flag, Kenya does not have a national dress that transcends its diverse ethnic divisions. With more than 42 ethnic communities having their own traditional practices and symbols unique to them, this is a task that has proved elusive. However, several attempts have been made to design an outfit that can be worn as a national dress, much like the Kente cloth of Ghana.\nKitenge is a cotton fabric made into colours and design through tie-and-dye and heavy embroidery. It is commonly worn by a number of Kenya's populations. Though also worn in many other African countries, Kitenge is yet to be accepted in Kenya as an official dress as it is only worn during ceremonies and non-official functions. The Maasai wear dark red garments to symbolise their love for the earth and their dependence on it. It also stands for courage and blood that is given to them by nature.\nThe Kanga (Khanga, Lesso) is another cloth that is commonly worn in practically every Kenyan home. The Kanga is a piece of clothing about 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) by 1 metre (3 ft 3 in), screen printed with beautiful sayings in Swahili (or English) and is largely worn by women around the waist and torso.\n\n## Music\nKenya is home to a diverse range of music styles, ranging from imported popular music, afro-fusion and benga music to traditional folk songs. The guitar is the most popular instrument in Kenyan music, and songs often feature intricate guitar rhythms. The most famous guitarist of the early 20th century was Bonie Makie. Other notable musicians of the 60s era include Fadhili Williams, recognised by many as the author of the hit song \"Malaika\" that was later re-done by Miriam Makeba, Boney M and Daudi Kabaka.\nPopular music in the 1980s and 1990s in Kenya could be divided into two genres: the Swahili sound and the Congolese sound. There are varying regional styles, and some performers create tourist-oriented \"hotel pop\" that is similar to western music. Them Mushrooms, later renamed Uyoga, was one of the popular groups in this era.\nIn the recent past, newer varieties of modern popular music have arisen which are mostly local derivatives of western hip-hop. Two subgenres have emerged: \"Genge\" and \"Kapuka\" beats. This has revolutionised popular Kenyan music and created an industry dominated by the youth. There is also underground Kenyan hip hop that gets less radio play than Kapuka or Genge because it is less club oriented and more focussed on social commentary. Early pioneers include Poxi Presha, Kalamashaka, and K-South. In Nairobi, hip-hop is viewed as more of a style than as a musical culture. There is a great correlation between the youth who listen to rap music and their economical status in the country with the majority of them coming from wealthy economic backgrounds. Since hip-hop is portrayed through clothing, magazines, and CDs, all of which are expensive, only the wealthier individuals are able to enjoy these luxuries.\nMainstream artists include Nameless, Redsan, Necessary Noize, Nonini, Juacali, Kleptomaniax, Longombas, Suzzanna Owiyo, Achieng Abura, Eric Wainaina and others. Their sounds run the gamut from Reggae/Ragga, Pop, Afro-Fusion to Hip-Hop. Contemporary Kenyan music is becoming quite popular, with African-based music channels such as Channel O and MTV Base, giving them a greater audience(a hybrid of Kenyan languages and English/Swahili).\nThe Kisima Music Awards, which recognise musical talent across East Africa, were founded and are currently based in Kenya. Every year numerous Kenyan artists take out categories in the scheme.\nThe African Children's Choir features children, many of whom are orphaned, from Kenya, as well as from other neighbouring African countries.\n\n## Literature\nKenya National Theatre plays a significant role in Literature by providing platform to most of the local artists, particularly for spoken word and stage acting performances. Artists like \"Kennet B\" and his group at National Theatre have had great performances in High schools and in the local Radio and Television. A lot of wax painting and color printing done within villages like Kibra and Railway Museum significantly describe Kenyan literature. \nAdditionally, students in Kenyan High Schools have studied many \"set books\" from various Kenyan authors like Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Margaret Ogola, Meja Mwangi among others. Their works considerably explore the political, social-economic and contemporary themes in Kenya. \nOther places that one can experience the Kenyan creatives are Sarakasi Dome.\n\n## Art\nAround Lake Turkana exist ancient petroglyphs depicting human figures and animals. Bantu tribes build funeral posts, where carvings of human heads atop geometric designs are still created. Though the original posts no longer exist, the more recent creations are thought to be a continuation of the practice. The Kikuyu people also uphold the designs of ancient tradition through the designs painted on their shields.\n\n## Media\n\n\n### Film\nThe government has not been very supportive of the film industry in Kenya resulting in the release of only few locally made films. However, a number of foreign productions have been shot in the country. Such most recent movie is the award-winning The Constant Gardener directed by Fernando Meirelles and starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. Other films shot in Kenya in the recent past include the Academy Award winning Nowhere in Africa and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.\nSheena, Queen of the Jungle won great acclaim in the 1980s and was one of the first foreign movies to be shot entirely on location in Kenya. Other highly acclaimed films set (and shot) in Kenya include Karen Blixen's Out of Africa, starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep and directed by Sydney Pollack, and Born Free, an adaptation of the autobiography of Joy Adamson. In 1999, part of the movie To Walk With Lions, which featured actor Richard Harris, was shot on location in the country. Notable film actors from Kenya include Paul Onsongo, David Mulwa, Sidede Onyulo, John Sibi Okumu and Njeri Osaak.\nDie Weiße Massai (The White Masai), a German movie about a Swiss Woman who fell in love with a Samburu (Maasai) warrior; won an Award as the best Foreign language Movie (2006) though it was received very poorly in Kenya itself. Rise and Fall of Idi Amin, based on the Ugandan dictator, was shot in Kenya and is considered one of the most successful movies produced and directed by a Kenyan (Sharad Patel). Indigenous Kenyan filmmakers include Ingolo Wa Keya, Albert Wandago and Judy Kibinge.\nNowhere in Africa (Nirgendwo in Afrika – 2001), an award-winning German production, tells a story about German Jewish refugees living in Kenya during Second World War. Most of the movie is set in Kenya and numerous scenes show actors, either Kenyans or main German actors, speaking Swahili.\nSome of the latest notable productions include the footage screened to the music of U2, Robbie Williams, R.E.M. and other acts at the Live 8 concerts in Europe and the US in July 2005, Africa Mon Amor, shot over a period of three months in Samburu, Shaba and Lamu with a renowned German actress, Iris Berben, in 2006.\nThe Kenya Film Commission (KFC) was established by the Kenyan government in 2005, but only became fully operational in mid-2006.\n\n### Television\nActing for television has proved popular with the Kenyan audience. This genre has been around from the 1960s when actors like Mzee Pembe graced the Kenyan television screen. Others, like Benson Wanjau (Ojwang' Hatari) and Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), followed later with their comedies presented exclusively in Swahili, reaching millions of households courtesy of Kenya Broadcasting Corporation television station.\nSerious Television drama was witnessed for the first time in the early 1990s with the entry of popular actors like Packson Ngugi, BMJ Muriithi alias Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi and Betty Achieng', alongside other thespians who featured in a variety of TV shows following the liberalisation of the airwaves by the Kenyan government. Tushauriane, a Swahili television series featuring Kenyan fine actors like Dennis Kashero and Tony Msalame had premiered in the late 1980s becoming arguably one of the most popular productions to ever hit the Kenyan TV screens.\nA new genre in the form of stand-up comedy followed when actor Joni Nderitu entered the scene. The new style was later to be perfected by the group, 'Redykyulass', a trio of young Kenyans – Walter Mong'are, Tony Njuguna and John Kiare (KJ) – who specialized in political satire. They lampooned not only the establishment but also Daniel arap Moi, the Kenyan President at the time. The lampooning of the Kenyan head of state was unprecedented and could have easily led to their prosecution, or even detention without trial, had it been done in the 1980s, when mimicking the head of state and exhibiting any form of political dissent was considered treason.\nOther Stations known to promote theatre in Kenya include Nation TV, Kenya Television Network (KTN) a Citizen TV, all based in the nation's capital, Nairobi. K24, the newest TV station to enter the scene, started its test run in Nairobi in December 2007. It captured the interest of many mainly because of the introduction of Jeff Koinange, one of the most popular Kenyan journalists who has worked for major international media houses like CNN, as its chief News anchor.\nA satellite- and Internet-based 24-hour pan-African TV channel, A24, was scheduled to start broadcasting from Nairobi in 2008. This will be in honor and memory of world-renowned and award-winning Kenyan Photojournalist, Mohamed Amin.\n\n## Theatre\nKenya holds an annual drama event, the Kenya schools and colleges drama festival which brings together thespians and students from around the country. The Kenya National Theatre is based in Nairobi opposite the Norfolk Hotel. Notable theatre performing groups include Eliud Abuto's Festival of Creative Arts that stages regular stage performances at both the Kenya National Theatre and Alliance Francaise, Phoenix Players based at the Professional Centre, Heartstrings Ensemble and Mombasa Little Theatre Club based in Mombasa.\nNotable names on the Kenyan theatre scene include actresses Stella Awinja Muka and Anne Wanjugu (both deceased), Liz Njaga and Idi Achieng'. Thespians like Steve Mwenesi, Paul Onsongo, Njeri Osaak, Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi popularly known as BMJ Muriithi, Gilbert Lukalia, Joseph Murungu and Packson Ngugi are just but a few of notable TV, stage and film actors from the country. Renowned director Tirus Gathwe cut a niche for himself and is perhaps one of the most well known theatre directors in Kenya today. In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, Wahome Mutahi followed in the footsteps of the legendary Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o when he, through Igiza Productions, teamed up with Tirus Gathwe and embarked on a project dubbed \"taking Theatre to the people\" which saw them stage numerous productions, mainly political satires, at nightspots throughout the country.\nOther notable directors include Carole Odongo, Mbeki Mwalimu, Mumbi Kaigwa as well as Nice Githinji (who is also an award-winning actor) are some of the most popular female directors in Kenya. George Mungai of Phoenix, Keith Pearson, Sammy Mwangi, Gilbert Lukalia, John Sibi-Okumu and Victor Ber are well known directors too.\n\n## Video gaming\nVideo gaming is a young and rapidly growing sector in Kenya. Though various start-up companies have appeared in the country since 2007, the existing businesses are dealing with funding issues and few successes have been made. However, shared spaces, support programs and government grants introduced over the past few years have allowed the industry to grow large in a short period of time. The introduction of broadband internet in 2009 spawned a generation of young ICT savvy people in the country and the Kenyan game industry is as of 2015 among the largest in Africa.\nIn 2016, the industry has grown rapidly and continues with popular video game entertainment companies such as Gaming For Kenya, NAICCON and Nexgen Gaming handling major events in the country as well as promoting the gaming culture. Gaming For Kenya, otherwise known as G4k, have held several gaming events from LAN parties to eSports competitive events since they began. Others include video game retailers such as Vivid Gold, Gamechanger, and GametroniQ that have dominated in terms of supplying gamers with console-based games for PlayStation and Xbox. Also prevalent are gaming lounges where gamers sit down to enjoy which are several in number. The largest and most advanced gaming lounge being Tric Gaming Lounge followed by GameMasters, The Score Gaming Lounge and many more. So far sponsorships have been growing with interest in the industry with the likes of ASUS and Red Bull having their presence at most of the gaming events.\nIn terms of events, there are several informal tournaments that are held within Nairobi city and some major towns in the country. The most renowned event being the 1UP Elite LAN parties held by G4k. A large number of gamers attend their events to connect with other gamers in a social ambiance and play with each other. In eSports, there are roughly established bodies governing eSports events with the likes of the Kenya International Gaming Series dubbed as \"K.IN.G.S\", the Vivid Gold Summer Tournaments, KAGE and many more.\nA new culture has also been adopted whereby some gamers in Kenya have also started their own YouTube and Twitch channels. Regionally, they are the most known gaming YouTubers.They use this platform to connect with their audience and build a strong following. They usually go by their gaming nicknames are otherwise known as gamertag, Jazi Neon, Gatman, King StevenNOS, Davy Kamanzi, The Watchmen, The Golden General, HastheemoHD, Ayax and many others. They have a progressively growing audience.\n\n## Christmas\nChristmas is a public holiday in Kenya, celebrated on 25 December. Because of its traffic, most Kenyans escape the mass exodus of urban areas to celebrate the festivity by leaving the cities and heading to their rural hometowns to spend the whole month with their families until the New Year.\nA very popular traditional Christmas meal of Kenya is nyama choma. Similar to barbecue, it includes the grilling of meat, such as beef, chicken, lamb and goat.\nOn Christmas Eve, churches are full of worshippers who hold night vigils, known in Swahili as Kesha. They are often recreated as a holy event with nativity scenes. At midnight, churches ring their bells to mark the birth of Christ, while people perform carols to mark the beginning of Christmas Day.\n\n## See also\nList of African cuisines\nList of ethnic groups of Kenya\nSport in Kenya\nInternational Inventories Programme\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nMagicalkenya.com\n\n## Further reading\nOdhiambo, Christopher Joseph (2008).

    "text": "# Khichdi (dish)\n\nKhichdi or khichri (Urdu: کھچڑی, romanised: khicṛī, Hindi: खिचड़ी, romanised: khicṛī, pronounced [ˈkʰɪtʃɽiː], Bengali: খিচুড়ি, romanised: Khicuṛi, Odia: ଖେଚୁଡି) is a dish in South Asian cuisine made of rice and lentils (dal) with numerous variations. Variations include bajra and mung dal khichri. In Indian culture, in several regions, especially in the northern areas, it is considered one of the first solid foods that babies eat.\n\n## Etymology and spelling\nThe word Khichdī is derived from Sanskrit खिच्चा khiccā, a dish of rice and legumes.\nSome divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word khicṛī. The sound is the retroflex flap [ɽ], which is written in Hindi with the Devanagari letter ⟨ड़⟩, and in Urdu script with the Perso-Arabic letter ⟨ڑ⟩. In Hindustani phonology, the etymological origin of the retroflex flap was /ɖ/ when it occurred between vowels. Hence in Devanagari the letter ⟨ड⟩, representing /ɖ/, was adapted to write /ɽ/ by adding a diacritic under it. In Urdu script, the phonological quality of the flap was represented by adapting the letter ⟨ر⟩, representing /r/, with a diacritic added above it to indicate the retroflex quality. The occurrence of this consonant in the word khicṛī has given rise to two alternative spellings in English: khichri, which reflects its phonology, and khichdi, which reflects its etymology.\n\n## History\nThe Greek king Seleucus during his campaign in India (305-303 BC), mentioned that rice with pulses is very popular among people of the Indian subcontinent. Strabo also notes that Indian food mainly consisted of rice porridge and a beverage made of rice, presently called arak. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta mentions khichdi as a dish in India composed of rice and mung beans, during his stay around 1350. khichdi is described in the writings of Afanasiy Nikitin, a Russian adventurer who travelled to the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century. It was very popular with the Mughals, especially Jahangir. Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century document written by Mughal Emperor Akbar's vizier, Abu'l Fadl, mentions the recipe for khichdi, which gives seven variations. There is an anecdotal story about khichdi featuring Akbar and his court advisor, Birbal.\nThe Anglo-Indian dish kedgeree is thought to derive from khichri.\n\n## Regional variations\nKhichdi is a very popular dish across the Indian subcontinent which consists of, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The dish is also widely prepared in many Indian states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Maharashtra. Vegetables such as cauliflower, potato, and green peas are commonly added.\nHindus, mainly from north/northwest, who avoid eating grains during fasting, eat Sabudana khichri made from sago. In the southern part of India, however, the word khichri is not that popular. While people of Tamil Nadu and Andhra regions cook Pongal, and Kannadigas prepare Huggi which is mung dal khichdi and Bisi bele bhath, a pigeon pea variation with vegetables, Keralites have no similar dish.\nKhichdi was the inspiration for Anglo-Indian kedgeree Khichdi is a popular traditional staple in Haryana, specially in the rural areas. Haryanvi khichdi is made from pearl millet and mung dal (split mung bean) pounded in mortar (unkhal), and often eaten by mixing with warm ghee or lassi, or even yogurt. Sometimes, jowar is also mixed with bajra and mung dal.\nThe Hyderabadi Muslim community, of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in present-day Telangana, Marathwada, and Kalyana-Karnataka regions, make khichdi as a common breakfast dish, and is an important part of Hyderabadi cuisine. The dish is called khichri, kheema, khatta, or other switch-around versions of the previous, named after the three parts of the meal, Khichri, ground beef, and a sour sauce, made of tamarind and sesame.\nKhichra is similar to haleem, a meat dish, while khichra is a vegetarian dish with rice and pulses or lentils, with no spices.\n\n## National dish controversy\nIn 2017, Indian media unofficially designated it as the \"national dish\", as it is being globally promoted by the government of India as \"queen of all foods\". The report that the government may designate khichri as India's \"national dish\" brought significant ridicule from the opposition politicians.\nHowever, India's Minister of Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal clarified that while khichdi is considered nutritious and healthy food in India, the government did not have any plans to designate a national food.\n\n## In popular culture\nKhichdi has lent its name to media synonymous with ensembles or potpourri as depicted in the popular culture through movies such as Khichdi: The Movie, and TV sitcoms such as Khichdi and Instant Khichdi.\nThe dish has been cooked at both MasterChef Australia and America.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\n\nKedgeree\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Kottu\n\nKottu roti (Tamil: கொத்து ரொட்டி; Sinhala: කොත්තු රොටි), alternatively spelled kothu roti, is a Sri Lankan Tamil dish consisting of chopped roti, a meat curry dish of choice (such as beef, mutton, seafood, chicken) along with scrambled egg, onions, and chillies. A variation of the dish is found in the south Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, known as kothu parotta (Tamil: கொத்து பரோட்டா; Malayalam: കൊത്തു പൊറോട്ട), which is made using parotta instead of roti. Kottu roti can also be found internationally in restaurants in regions containing Sri Lankan diaspora populations.\n\n## History\nThe word koththu means \"to chop\" in Tamil,referring to its method of preparation, as the ingredients are commonly chopped together using special cleavers, whilst they sauté on a hot griddle. This has been simplified in Tamil and Sinhalese to Kothu or Kottu respectively.\nIt is generally thought to have originated as street food in the eastern province of Sri Lanka in the 1960s/1970s, as an inexpensive meal for the lower socio-economic classes. The basic roti is made of Gothamba flour, a wheat flour made out of a variety of grains-referring to the white flour, also known as wheat roti or gothamba/godamba roti in Sinhala and \"veechu parotta\", \"veechu roti\" in Tamil.\nTraditionally, kottu is made from recycling day-old godamba rotis, which are chopped up into small strips and mixed with an assortment of spices, fried vegetables, possibly egg or meat, and topped with chillies and onions. The old roti chunks were castoffs the bakers couldn't sell, and an enterprising lower class took advantage of the inexpensive food source.\n\n## Preparation\nKottu, is made up of paratha or wheat flour roti (Godamba roti), which is cut into small pieces or ribbons. Then on a heated iron sheet or griddle, vegetables and onions are fried. Eggs, cooked meat, or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally, the pieces of cut paratha are added. These are chopped and mixed by repeated pounding using heavy iron blades/spatula, the sound of which is very distinctive and can usually be heard from a long distance. Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable, egg, beef, chicken, mutton, and fish kottu roti. It is often prepared and served as a fast food dish.\n\n## See also\nCuisine of Sri Lanka\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Kottu at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Lamb and mutton\n\nLamb and mutton, collectively sheep meat (or sheepmeat) is one of the most common meats around the world, taken meat from the domestic sheep, Ovis aries, and generally divided into lamb, from sheep in their first year, hogget, from sheep in their second, and mutton, from older sheep.\nIn South Asian and Caribbean cuisine, \"mutton\" often means goat meat.

The stronger-tasting mutton is now hard to find in many areas, despite the efforts of the Mutton Renaissance Campaign in the UK. In Australia, the term prime lamb is often used to refer to lambs raised for meat. Other languages, such as French, Spanish, and Italian, make similar or even more detailed distinctions among sheep meats by age and sometimes by sex and diet—for example, lechazo in Spanish refers to meat from milk-fed (unweaned) lambs.\n\n## Classifications and nomenclature\nThe definitions for lamb, hogget and mutton vary considerably between countries. Younger lambs are smaller and tenderer. Mutton is meat from a sheep over two years old, and has tougher flesh. In general, the darker the colour, the older the animal.\n\n### Britain, Australia, and New Zealand\nLamb\nA young sheep which is less than one year old. From 1 July 2019, the Australian definition is \"an ovine animal that: (a) is under 12 months of age, or (b) does not have any permanent incisor teeth in wear\". This new definition meant that Australian farmers could extend the term \"lamb\" by another month. This followed a similar definition change in New Zealand in 2018. In Britain the definition is still \"0 permanent incisor teeth\". A permanent incisor tooth is said to be \"in wear\" if it protrudes further than the nearest milk teeth.\nHogget\nA sheep of either sex having no more than two permanent incisors in wear. The term is also used to refer to meat from the aforementioned animal. In the UK, it means animals that are 11 to 24 months old, while Australian butchers use the term for animals that are 13 to 24 months old. Still common in farming usage and among speciality butchers, it is now a rare term in British, Australian and New Zealand supermarkets, where meat of all sheep less than two years old tends to be called \"lamb\".\nMutton\nThe meat of a female (ewe) or castrated male (wether) sheep having more than two permanent incisors in wear.\n\n### Italy\nIn Romanesco dialect, the offspring of the sheep who is still suckling or recently weaned is called abbacchio, while the offspring of the sheep almost a year old who has already been shorn twice is called agnello (lit. 'lamb'). This distinction exists only in the Romanesco dialect. Abbacchio is consumed throughout central Italy as an Easter and Christmas dish. It is a product protected by the European Union with the PGI mark.\nThroughout central Italy, including Sardinia, pastoralism was the main source of meat. Since ancient times, abbacchio has been one of the staple foods of the Lazio region, especially for rural communities, whose consumption at the table was considerable. The tradition of consuming abbacchio spread in ancient times where mainly adult sheep were slaughtered. The slaughter of abbacchio was forbidden except during the Easter and Christmas periods, and until June. Over the centuries, given the importance of the food, around 100 recipes for preparing lamb have been developed in Lazio. Given the importance of abbacchio in social life, historical events dedicated to abbacchio are still organized in the Lazio region today, i.e. sagre, country festivals and popular events. In ancient times, sheep was eaten during work in the countryside, while abbacchio was consumed only during the Easter holidays.\n\n### South Asia\nThe term \"mutton\" is applied to goat meat in most countries of South Asia, and the goat population has been rising. For example, mutton curry is usually made from goat meat. It is estimated that over a third of the goat population is slaughtered every year and sold as mutton. The domestic sheep population in India and the Indian subcontinent has been in decline for over 40 years and has survived at marginal levels in mountainous regions, based on wild-sheep breeds, and mainly for wool production.\nHowever, in some Indian states(such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Telangana), sheep meat is also popular.\n\n### United States\nIn the early 1900s, mutton was widely consumed in the United States, but mutton consumption has declined since World War II. As of 2010, most sheep meat in the United States comes from animals in between 12 and 14 months old, and is called \"lamb\"; the term \"hogget\" is not used. Federal statutes and regulations dealing with food labeling in the United States permit all sheep products to be marketed as \"lamb.\" USDA grades for lamb are only partly a function of the animal's age. Animals up to 20 months old may meet the quality of the \"USDA prime\" grade depending on other factors, while \"USDA choice\" lamb can be of any age.\n\"Spring lamb\" is defined by the USDA as having been slaughtered between March and October.\n\n### Other types\nSuckling lamb or milk-fed lamb\nMeat from an unweaned lamb, typically 4–6 weeks old and weighing 5.5–8 kg; this is typically unavailable in the United States and the United Kingdom. The flavour and texture of milk-fed lamb when grilled (such as the small lamb cutlets known as chuletillas in Spain) or roasted (lechazo asado or cordero lechal asado) is generally thought to be finer than that of older lamb, and fetches higher prices. The areas in northern Spain where this can be found include Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, and La Rioja.  Milk-fed lambs are especially prized for Easter in Greece, when they are roasted on a spit.\nYoung lamb\nA milk-fed lamb between six and eight weeks old\nSpring lamb\nA lamb, usually three to five months old, born in late winter or early spring and sold usually before 1 July (in the northern hemisphere).\nSucker lambs\nA term used in Australia — includes young milk-fed lambs, as well as slightly older lambs up to about seven months of age which are also still dependent on their mothers for milk. Carcasses from these lambs usually weigh between 14 and 30 kg. Older weaned lambs which have not yet matured to become mutton are known as old-season lambs.\nYearling lamb\na young sheep between 12 and 24 months old\nSaltbush mutton\na term used in Australia for the meat of mature Merinos which have been allowed to graze on atriplex plants\nSalt marsh lamb\n(Also known as 'saltmarsh lamb' or by its French name, agneau de pré-salé) The meat of sheep which graze on salt marsh in coastal estuaries that are washed by the tides and support a range of salt-tolerant grasses and herbs, such as samphire, sparta grass, sorrel and sea lavender. Depending on where the salt marsh is located, the nature of the plants may be subtly different. Salt marsh lamb has long been appreciated in France and is growing in popularity in the United Kingdom. Places where salt marsh lamb are reared in the UK include Harlech and the Gower Peninsula in Wales, the Somerset Levels, Morecambe Bay and the Solway Firth.\nSaltgrass lamb\nA type of lamb exclusive to Flinders Island (Tasmania). The pastures on the island have a relatively high salt content, leading to a flavor and texture similar to saltmarsh lamb.\n\n## Butchery and cookery\nThe meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old, with a carcass weight of between 5.5 and 30 kg (12 and 66 lb). This meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and appears more often on tables in some Western countries. Hogget and mutton have a stronger flavour than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids and are preferred by some. Mutton and hogget also tend to be tougher than lamb (because of connective tissue maturation) and are therefore better suited to casserole-style cooking, as in Lancashire hotpot, for example.\nLamb is often sorted into three kinds of meat: forequarter, loin, and hindquarter. The forequarter includes the neck, shoulder, front legs, and the ribs up to the shoulder blade. The hindquarter includes the rear legs and hip. The loin includes the ribs between the two.\nLamb chops are cut from the rib, loin, and shoulder areas. The rib chops include a rib bone; the loin chops include only a chine bone. Shoulder chops are usually considered inferior to loin chops; both kinds of chops are usually grilled. Breast of lamb (baby chops) can be cooked in an oven.\nLeg of lamb is a whole leg; saddle of lamb is the two loins with the hip. Leg and saddle are usually roasted, though the leg is sometimes boiled.\nForequarter meat of sheep, as of other mammals, includes more connective tissue than some other cuts, and, if not from a young lamb, is best cooked slowly using either a moist method, such as braising or stewing, or by slow roasting or American barbecuing. It is, in some countries, sold already chopped or diced.\nMutton barbeque is a tradition in Western Kentucky. The area was strong in the wool trade, which gave them plenty of older sheep that needed to be put to use.\n\n## Cuts\n\n\n### UK, Canada, and other Commonwealth countries\nApproximate zones of the usual UK cuts of lamb:\n\nScrag end (of neck)\nMiddle neck\nBest End (of neck)\nLoin\nChump (and chump chops)\nBarnsley chop, a large double loin chop.\nLeg (gigot in Scotland)\nShank\nShoulder\nBreast\n\n### US and Ireland\nSquare cut shoulder – shoulder roast, shoulder chops and arm chops\nRack – rib chops and riblets, rib roast\nLoin – loin chops or roast\nLeg – sirloin chops, leg roast (leg of lamb)\nNeck\nBreast\nShanks (fore or hind)\nFlank\n\n### New Zealand\nForequarter\nNeck – neck chops\nShoulder – shoulder chops, shoulder roast (usually boned and rolled)\nRib-eye\nBreast\nKnuckle\nLoin\nRib-loin – racks, frenched cutlets, spare ribs\nMid-loin – striploin (backstrap), loin chops\nTenderloin\nFlap\nFull leg – leg roast (may be boned and rolled), leg chops. A short-cut leg is a full leg without the chump; a carvery leg is a short-cut leg without the thick flank\nChump (rump) – chump chops, rump steak\nThick flank (knuckle) – schnitzel\nTopside & silverside – steaks\nShank\n\n## Production and consumption figures\n\n\n### Sheep meat consumption\nAccording to the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook for 2016, the top consumers of sheep meat in 2015 were as follows: EU countries are not individually surveyed in this list. Among EU nations, Greece is the per capita leader in consumption at 12.3 kg, with Cyprus following right after, while the UK's annual per capita lamb consumption is 4.7 kg. Outside of the OECD, the largest per capita consumer overall is Mongolia, with 45.1 kg.\n\n### Sheep meat production\nThe table below gives a sample of producing nations, but many other significant producers in the 50–120 kt range are not given.\n\n## Dishes\nMeat from sheep features prominently in the cuisines of several Mediterranean cultures including Greece, Croatia, Turkey, North Africa, Jordan, and the Middle East, as well as in the cuisines of Iran and Afghanistan. In Greece, for example, it is an integral component of many meals and of religious feasts such as Easter, like avgolemono and magiritsa. It is also popular in the Basque culture, both in the Basque country of Europe and in shepherding parts of the Western United States (where shepherds of Basque descent have been active since the 1850s). In the United States, the Navajo have incorporated mutton and lamb into their traditional cuisine since the introduction of sheep by Spanish explorers and settlers in the 17th century, replacing wild turkey and venison and creating a pastoral culture. In Northern Europe, mutton and lamb feature in many traditional dishes, including those of Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom.\nMutton is also popular in Australia. Lamb and mutton are very popular in Central Asia and in certain parts of China, where other red meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. Barbecued mutton is also a specialty in some areas of the United States (chiefly Owensboro, Kentucky) and Canada. However, meat from sheep is generally consumed far less in the US than in many European, Central American and Asian cuisines; for example, average per-capita consumption of lamb in the United States is only 400 grams (14 oz) per year.\nIn Australia, the leg of lamb roast is considered to be the national dish. Commonly served on a Sunday or any other special occasion, it can be done in a kettle BBQ or a conventional oven. Typical preparation involves covering the leg of lamb with butter, pushing rosemary sprigs into incisions cut in the leg, and sprinkling rosemary leaves on top. The lamb is then roasted for two hours at 180 °C (350 °F) and typically served with carrots and potato (also roasted), green vegetables and gravy.\nIn Indonesia, lamb is popularly served as lamb satay and lamb curry. Both dishes are cooked with various spices from the islands, and served with either rice or lontong. A version of lamb and bamboo shoot curry is the specialty of Minang cuisine, although similar dishes can be found in Thai cuisine.\nIn Mexico, lamb is the meat of choice for barbacoa, in which the lamb is roasted or steamed wrapped in maguey leaves underground.\nIn Japan, although lamb is not traditionally consumed in most of the country, on the northern island of Hokkaido and in the northeastern Tohoku regions, a hot-pot dish called jingisukan (i.e. \"Genghis Khan\") is popular. In that dish, thin-sliced lamb is cooked over a convex skillet alongside various vegetables and mushrooms in front of the diners, then dipped in soy-sauce-based dipping sauces and eaten. It was so named because lamb is popular in Mongolia (see \"Sheep meat consumption\" above).\n\n### Organ meats/offal\nLamb's liver, known as lamb's fry in New Zealand and Australia, is eaten in many countries. It is the most common form of offal eaten in the UK, traditionally used in the family favourite (and pub grub staple) of liver with onions, potentially also with bacon and mashed potatoes. It is a major ingredient, along with the lungs and heart (the pluck), in the traditional Scottish dish of haggis.\nLamb testicles or lamb fries are a delicacy in many parts of the world.\nLamb kidneys are found in many cuisines across Europe and the Middle East, often split into two halves and grilled (on kebabs in the Middle East), or sautéed in a sauce. They are generally the most highly regarded of all kidneys.\nLamb sweetbreads are a delicacy in many cuisines.\n\n## Nutrition and health effects\nLamb and mutton are forms of red meat. Red meat is a good source of protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), unprocessed red meat probably leads to an increased risk of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. Studies have also linked red meat with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. If meat is processed, such as by salting, curing, or smoking, health risks further increase. The World Cancer Research Fund recommends limiting red meat to no more than three servings per week.\n\n## Environmental impact\nProduction of lamb emits more greenhouse gas per gram of protein than other common foods, except for beef.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## Bibliography\nK.F.

    "text": "# Lentil\n\nThe lentil (Vicia lens or Lens culinaris) is an annual legume grown for its lens-shaped edible seeds or pulses, also called lentils. It is about 40 cm (16 in) tall, and the seeds grow in pods, usually with two seeds in each.\nLentil seeds are used around the world for culinary purposes, most commonly in stews or soups. In cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, where lentils are a staple, split lentils (often with their hulls removed) known as dal are often cooked into a thick curry that is usually eaten with rice or roti.\n\n## Etymology\nThe English word \"lentil\" ultimately derives from the Latin lens ('lentil'). The Latin word is of classical Roman or Latin origin and may be the source of the prominent Roman family name Lentulus, just as the family name \"Cicero\" was derived from the chickpea, Cicer arietinum, and \"Fabia\" (as in Quintus Fabius Maximus) from the fava bean (Vicia faba).\n\n## Taxonomy\nThe genus Vicia is part of the subfamily Faboideae which is contained in the flowering plant family Fabaceae or commonly known as legume or bean family, of the order Fabales in the kingdom Plantae.\n\nThe former genus Lens, now considered a section of genus Vicia, consisted of the cultivated L. culinaris and six related wild taxa. As members of genus Lens, these six are Lens orientalis, Lens tomentosus, Lens lamottei, Lens odemensis, Lens ervoides, and Lens nigricans. The seven members are often referred to as \"taxa\" instead of \"species\" and/or \"subspecies\", as while it is broadly agreed there are seven of them, whether they constitute distinct species is not broadly agreed on. Among the wild taxa, L. orientalis is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil L. culinaris. Of the taxa, L. culinaris and L. orientalis are most often considered subspecies, and so are often also classified as L. culinaris subsp. culinaris and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis respectively. Following reassignment to genus Vicia, they may also be referred to as Vicia lens subsp. culinaris and Vicia lens subsp. orientalis.\n\n## Botanical description\nLentil is hypogeal, which means the cotyledons of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat. Therefore, it is less vulnerable to frost, wind erosion, or insect attack.\nThe plant is a diploid, annual, bushy herb of erect, semierect, or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from 30 to 50 centimetres (12 to 20 in) in height. It has many hairy branches and its stem is slender and angular. The rachis bears 10 to 15 leaflets in five to eight pairs. The leaves are alternate, of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour. In general, the upper leaves are converted into tendrils, whereas the lower leaves are mucronate. If stipules are present, they are small. The flowers, one to four in number, are small, white, pink, purple, pale purple, or pale blue in colour. They arise from the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves. The pods are oblong, slightly inflated, and about 1.5 centimetres (5⁄8 in) long. Normally, each of them contains two seeds, about 0.5 centimetres (1⁄4 in) in diameter, in the characteristic lens shape. The seeds can also be mottled and speckled. The several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds.\nLentils are self-pollinating. The flowering begins from the lowermost buds and gradually moves upward, so-called acropetal flowering. About two weeks are needed for all the flowers to open on the single branch. At the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers, they close completely and the colour begins to fade. After three to four days, the setting of the pods takes place.\n\n## Types\nLentil may be classified for market based on an array of seed qualities. These qualities may include the size, shape (\"round\" or \"lens\"), seed coat colour and pattern, seed coat thickness, and internal cotyledon colour. The parameters for market type or classification name may also vary according to region. Additionally, when sold, lentil may be further classified according to whether it is hulled (seed coat removed) or unhulled, and if hulled, whether the cotyledon inside is split or left whole.\nLentil seed coat colour can be broadly grouped into tan, grey, green, brown, clear or black, the first four of which will slowly turn brown over time. Black seed coat, which can present solid black (almost purple) or slightly patchy, acts like a pattern, masking the \"ground\" colour (tan, grey, green or brown) beneath, while clear coats lack pigmentation altogether. Seed coat colour is also influenced by the colour of the cotyledon, though this does not usually affect market classification.\nSeed coat patterning is usually selected against in most market types with the exception of Puy or \"French green\" lentil, which has \"marbled\" patterning. As well as \"marbled\" (which comes in two genetic variants termed Marbled-1 and Marbled-2), coats may be \"spotted\", \"dotted\", \"mottled\", or show complex/mixed patterns. Seed coat colour is determined by the genotype of the seed parent, rather than the genetics of the plant the seed will become.\nCommon cotyledon colours are an orange-red colour and a light yellow, usually just called \"red\" (occasionally \"orange\") and \"yellow\" respectively. Three other colours, a brown-yellow, a light green, and a dark green have also been documented.\n\n### Red lentil\nRed lentil varieties are defined by their red cotyledon, and moderate to thin seed coat. Red lentil varieties tend to be smaller than those of their green/brown counterparts, with large red lentil varieties meeting a similar size to small green lentil varieties. As the seed coat of red lentil is often removed, colour and pattern aren't usually selected for, though in recent years Australian red lentil varieties have been standardised for grey seed coats to allow for cultivars to be mixed. Australia is the largest producer of red lentil.\n\n### Green and brown lentil\nGreen and brown lentil varieties have yellow cotyledon, usually moderate or thin, and green or brown seed coats. Canada is the largest producer of green lentil. These lentils are sometimes referred to by notable historic cultivars instead of by size, especially in North America: for example, small green lentil may be referred to as Eston-types, large green lentils as Laird-types, and large brown lentil as Brewer-types. These lentils rarely hold their shape when cooked, and so are often used in soups or stews.\n\n### Specialty types\nBlack lentil\n\nBeluga Black: The commercial/trade name of cultivar \"Indianhead\", named for the \"Indian Head\" research station in Canada where they were first selected for trial. These are one of the smallest cultivars and bead-like and almost spherical, with yellow cotyledon and black seed coat. While Beluga lentil was originally grown as a fodder crop, it became something of a designer food in the 1990s, and was given the name it is now known by for its resemblance to beluga caviar. This variety holds its form well when cooked, owing to thick seed coat, and is widely used in breeding program as a source of disease resistance.\nMt. Byron Black: Almost as small as Beluga lentil, Mt. Byron Black are a cultivar with black seed coat and red cotyledons.\nRegional types\n\nPuy lentils (var. puyensis): Small blue-green lentil with mottling, originating from France with a Protected Designation of Origin name. Lentils of this type, when grown outside of France, are often referred to a \"French Green\" lentils.\nAlb-Leisa three traditional genotypes of lentils native to the Swabian Jura (Alps) in Germany and protected by the producers' association Öko-Erzeugergemeinschaft Alb-Leisa (engl. \"Eco-producer association Alb-Leisa\")\nOther\n\nSpanish Brown/Pardina: Small round lentils with yellow cotyledon and medium-thick brown seedcoats. Despite the name, modern \"Spanish Brown\" does not originate from Spain. The cultivar Pardina, for example, is from a cross made in the US and subsequently trialled in Spain, where they were quite common (hence the name). Australian Materno, also considered a Spanish Brown variety, is a cross between Canadian cultivar CDC Matador and ILL7537, a breeding line which traces back to the ICARDA breeding program.\nZero Tannin/Clear-Coat: Yellow cotyledon lentils with thin clear coats. Not widely commercialised.\nGreen cotyledon: Green cotyledon lentils with green coats. Not widely commercialised.\n\n## Production\nIn 2023, world production of dry lentils was 7 million tonnes, led by Australia, Canada, and India, which together accounted for 72% of the total (table).\n\n## Cultivation\n\n\n### History\nThe cultivated lentil Vicia lens subsp. lens was derived from its wild subspecies V. lens subsp. orientalis, although other species may also have contributed some genes, according to Jonathan Sauer (Historical Geography of Crop Plants, 2017). Unlike their wild ancestors, domesticated lentil crops have indehiscent pods and non-dormant seeds.\nLentil was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East and then spread to Europe and North Africa and the Indo-Gangetic plain. The primary center of diversity for the domestic Vicia lens as well as its wild progenitor V. lens ssp. lamottei is considered to be the Middle East. The oldest known carbonized remains of lentil from Greece's Franchthi Cave are dated to 11,000 BC. In archaeobotanical excavations carbonized remains of lentil seeds have been recovered from widely dispersed places such as Tell Ramad in Syria (6250–5950 BC), Aceramic Beidha in Jordan, Hacilar in Turkey (5800–5000 BC), Tepe Sabz (Ita. Tepe Sabz) in Iran (5500–5000 BC) and Argissa-Magula Tessaly in Greece (6000–5000 BC), among other places. Lentils were part of the ancient Israelite diet, served roasted or prepared as a soup/stew, as indicated by several biblical passages. Archaeological excavations at Tel Beit Shemesh have uncovered lentil remains dating from the Iron Age.\n\n### Soil requirements\nLentils can grow on various soil types, from sand to clay loam, growing best in deep sandy loam soils with moderate fertility. A soil pH around 7 would be the best. Lentils do not tolerate flooding or water-logged conditions.\nLentils improve the physical properties of soils and increase the yield of succeeding cereal crops. Biological nitrogen fixation or other rotational effects could be the reason for higher yields after lentils.\n\n### Climate requirements\nThe conditions under which lentils are grown differ across different growing regions. In the temperate climates lentils are planted in the winter and spring under low temperatures and vegetative growth occurs in later spring and the summer. Rainfall during this time is not limited. In the subtropics, lentils are planted under relatively high temperatures at the end of the rainy season, and vegetative growth occurs on the residual soil moisture in the summer season. Rainfall during this time is limited. In West Asia and North Africa, some lentils are planted as a winter crop before snowfall. Plant growth occurs during the time of snow melting. Under such cultivation, seed yields are often much higher.\n\n### Seedbed requirements and sowing\nThe lentil requires a firm, smooth seedbed with most of the previous crop residues incorporated. For the seed placement and for later harvesting it is important that the surface is not uneven with large clods, stones, or protruding crop residue. It is also important that the soil be made friable and weed-free, so that seeding can be done at a uniform depth.\nThe plant densities for lentils vary between genotypes, seed size, planting time and growing conditions, and also from region to region. In South Asia, a seed rate of 30 to 40 kilograms per hectare (27 to 36 pounds per acre) is recommended. In West Asian countries, a higher seed rate is recommended, and also leads to a higher yield. The seeds should be sown 3 to 4 centimetres (1+1⁄4 to 1+1⁄2 in) deep. In agriculturally mechanized countries, lentils are planted using grain drills, but many other areas still hand broadcast.\n\n### Cultivation management, fertilization\nIn intercropping systems – a practice commonly used in lentil cultivation – herbicides may be needed to assure crop health. Like many other legume crops, lentils can fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil with specific rhizobia. Lentils grow well under low fertilizer input conditions, although phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur may be used for nutrient-poor soils.\n\n### Diseases\nBelow is a list of the most common lentil diseases.\n\n## Use by humans\n\n\n### Processing\nA combination of gravity, screens and air flow is used to clean and sort lentils by shape and density. After destoning, they may be separated by a color sorter and then packaged.\nA major part of the world's red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step. These lentils are dehulled, split and polished. In the Indian subcontinent, this process is called dal milling. The moisture content of the lentils prior to dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency. The hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the total seed weight, which is lower than most legumes. Lentil flour can be produced by milling the seeds, like cereals.\n\n### Culinary use\nLentils can be eaten soaked, germinated, fried, baked or boiled – the most common preparation method. The seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the variety; small varieties with the husk removed, such as the common red lentil, require shorter cooking times (and unlike most legumes don't require soaking). Most varieties have a distinctive, earthy flavor. Lentils with husks remain whole with moderate cooking, while those without husks tend to disintegrate into a thick purée, which may enable various dishes. The composition of lentils leads to a high emulsifying capacity which can be even increased by dough fermentation in bread making.\n\n### Nutritional value\nBoiled lentils are 70% water, 20% carbohydrates, 9% protein, and 0.4% fat (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3+1⁄2 ounces), cooked lentils (boiled; variety unspecified) provide 114 calories, and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of folate (45% DV), copper (28% DV), and manganese (21% DV). They are a moderate source (10-19% DV) of thiamine, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, iron, and phosphorus, with other minerals in moderate content (table).\n\n## Breeding\nAlthough lentils have been an important crop for centuries, lentil breeding and genetic research have a relatively short history compared to that of many other crops. Since the inception of The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) breeding programme in 1977 significant gains have been made. It supplies landraces and breeding lines for countries around the world, supplemented by other programmes in both developing (e.g. India) and developed (e.g. Australia and Canada) countries. In recent years, such collaborations among breeders and agronomists are becoming increasingly important.\nThe focus lies on high yielding and stable cultivars for diverse environments to match the demand of a growing population. In particular, progress in quantity and quality as well as in the resistance to disease and abiotic stresses are the major breeding aims. Several varieties have been developed applying conventional breeding methodologies. Serious genetic improvement for yield has been made, however, the full potential of production and productivity could not yet be tapped due to several biotic and abiotic stresses.\nWild Lens species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop. The wild species possess many diverse traits including disease resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. The above-mentioned L. nigricans and L. orientalis possess morphological similarities to the cultivated L. culinaris. But only L. culinaris and L. culinaris subsp. orientalis are crossable and produce fully fertile seed. Between the different related species hybridisation barriers exist. According to their inter-crossability with  Lens taxa can be divided into three gene pools:\n\nPrimary gene pool:L. culinaris, L. orientalis, L. tomentosus\nSecondary gene pool: L. lamottei, L. odemensis, L. ervoides\nTertiary gene pool: L. nigricans\nCrosses generally fail between members of different gene pools. However, plant growth regulators and/or embryo rescue allows the growth of viable hybrids between groups. Even if crosses are successful, many undesired genes may be introduced as well in addition to the desired ones. This can be resolved by using a backcrossing programme. Thus, mutagenesis is crucial to create new and desirable varieties. According to Yadav et al. other biotechnology techniques which may impact on lentil breeding are micro-propagation using meristamatic explants, callus culture and regeneration, protoplast culture and doubled haploid production.\nThere is a proposed revision of the gene pools using SNP phylogeny.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nAlan Davidson, The Oxford Companion to Food.

Over the years it has gained international recognition.\nIt consists of a wheat dough ball filled with a mixture of roasted gram flour, spices, and herbs, which is then roasted on hot charcoal or dried cow dung fire. They can also be baked in an oven, roasted on a tava or fried.\n\n## Historical background\nThe history of Litti is deeply rooted in the Bhojpuri region of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the cities of Buxar and  Banaras. Both the Panchkosi Jatra and the Lota-Bhanta Mela are significant cultural and religious events in these regions, highlighting the ritualistic importance of Litti.\nThe Panchkosi Jatra, an annual pilgrimage held in Buxar, involves the circumambulation of five sacred sites. It starts every year on the fifth day of the dark fortnight of Agrahayana and lasts for five days. According to a legend from the Ramayana, Lord Ram consumed Litti-Chokha during his visit to Charitravan in Buxar while staying at the ashram of Maharishi Vishwamitra. As part of the Panchkosi Jatra, Litti is prepared and offered to Lord Ram as prasad at Charitravan on the final day of the journey, symbolizing devotion and preserving the dish’s ritualistic significance in the area's long-standing traditions. \nThe Lota-Bhanta Mela, held annually in Varanasi, on the sixth day of the dark fortnight of Agrahayana is another major festival linked to Litti (also called Baati). According to legend, Lord Ram is believed to have visited Kashi twice, performing the sacred Panchkosi Jatra—first to absolve King Dasharatha of a curse and later to atone for Brahmahatya after slaying Ravana. During his second pilgrimage, Lord Ram made a Shivling from sand, performed jalabhishek, and then prepared Litti-Chokha, offering it to Lord Shiva as bhog and later consuming it as prasad, completing his penance. This site is now known as Rameshwar Mahadev. As part of the Lota-Bhanta Mela, devotees bathe in the Varuna River, prepare Litti-Chokha, and offer it to Lord Shiva, continuing this sacred tradition of devotion. \nThe dish has its roots in the cuisine of Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and southern Nepal. It has been a part of local diets for centuries, often associated with the peasant and working-class populations. It is also said to have been a staple food for the armies of Magadh due to its long shelf life and nutritional value.\n\n## Description\nLitti is a dough ball made from whole wheat flour, stuffed with sattu (roasted gram flour) mixed with garlic, ginger, onions, coriander leaves, lime juice, carom seeds, nigella seeds, and mustard oil. Traditionally, it is cooked over a coal fire, giving it a distinct smoky flavour.\nChokha is prepared by mashing boiled vegetables, typically eggplant, tomatoes, and potatoes, mixed with garlic, green chilies, mustard oil, and various spices to enhance the flavour.\n\n### Ingredients\nLitti: Whole wheat flour, sattu (roasted gram flour), spices (garlic, ginger, carom seeds, nigella seeds), mustard oil and lime juice.\nChokha: Eggplant, potatoes, tomatoes, green chilies, garlic, mustard oil, salt, and cilantro.\n\n### Preparation\nTraditionally Litti Chokha is essentially two items Litti and Chokha, often served with accompaniments like pickle, salad, or green peppers.\n\nLitti: Whole wheat dough balls stuffed with a savory mixture of sattu (roasted chickpea flour), herbs, and spices. These are traditionally roasted over charcoal or cow dung fire for a smoky flavour, but can also be baked or pan-fried.\nChokha: A mashed vegetable relish made with roasted or grilled eggplant, tomato, and potato. It is often seasoned with onions, garlic, ginger, chilies, and spices. It is also called Baigan ka bharta.\nLitti is prepared by making dough balls from the wheat flour, which are then filled with the spiced sattu mixture. The balls are then baked until they turn golden brown. Chokha involves roasting or boiling the vegetables, which are then peeled and mashed with the rest of the spices and seasonings. Street vendors prepare Litti in a barbeque style.\n\n## Flavors and variations\nHerbs and spices used to flavour the litti include onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, lime juice, carom seeds, nigella seeds and salt. In Madhesh Province of Nepal, Litti is served with Momo Achar. In western Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, litti is served with murgh korma (a creamy chicken curry) or chokha (a vegetable preparation of roasted and mashed eggplant, tomato, and potato).\n\n## Popularity\nLitti-chokha was selected to represent the country under the banner of the National Association of Street food Vendors of India (NASVI) at the five-day event in the Philippines capital, Manila.\n\n## See also\nBhojpuri cuisine\nNepalese cuisine\nDal bati churma\nBihari culture\nFuchka\n\n\n== References ==",

For example, the South Indian dishes idli and dosa, as well as Chinese and Western dishes such as pizza, are popular in home cooking and in restaurants.\nDistinctly Maharashtrian dishes include ukdiche modak, aluchi patal bhaji, kanda pohe and thalipeeth.\n\n## Regular meals and staple dishes\nSince they occupy a vast area with distinct geographical differences and food availability, the Marathi people from different regions have produced a diverse cuisine. The diversity extends to the family level because each family uses its own unique combination of spices and ingredients. The majority of Maharashtrians are not averse to eating meat, fish and eggs, but the staple diet for most people is mostly lacto-vegetarian. Many communities such as the brahmins and varkari sect members only follow the lacto-vegetarian diet.\nThe traditional staple food on Desh (the Deccan Plateau) is usually bhakri, spiced cooked vegetables, dal and rice. Bhakri is a flatbread made from sorghum (jowar) or bajri. However, North Maharashtrians and urbanites prefer roti or chapati, which is a plain bread made with wheat.\nIn the coastal Konkan region, rice is the traditional staple food. Wet coconut and coconut milk are used in many dishes. Marathi communities indigenous to Mumbai and North Konkan have their own distinct cuisine. In South Konkan, near Malvan, another independent cuisine developed called Malvani cuisine, which is predominantly non-vegetarian. Kombdi vade, fish preparations and baked preparations are more popular there.\nIn the Vidarbha region, little coconut is used in daily preparations but dry coconut and peanuts are used in dishes such as spicy savjis, as well as in mutton and chicken dishes.\nMaharashtrian lacto-vegetarian dishes are based on five main classes of ingredients that include grains, legumes, vegetables, dairy products and spices.\n\n### Grains\nStaple dishes in the cuisine are based on a variety of flatbreads and rice. Flatbreads can be wheat-based, such as the traditional trigonal ghadichi poli or the round chapati that is more common in urban areas. Bhakri is an unleavened bread made using grains such as ragi or millet, bajra or bajri or jwari and forms part of daily meals in rural areas.\n\n### Dairy\nMilk is important as a staple food. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used mainly for drinking, to add to tea or coffee or to make homemade dahi (yogurt). Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. The Dahi is used as dressing for many salad or koshimbir dishes, to prepare Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Taak) or as a side dish in a thali. Buttermilk is used in a drink called mattha by mixing it with spices. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified butter).\n\n### Vegetables\nUntil recently, canned or frozen food was not widely available in India. Therefore, the vegetables used in a meal widely depended on seasonal availability. In Maharashtra, spring (March–May) is the season of cabbages, onions, potatoes, bhēṇḍī, guar and tondaḷi, śēvgyācyā śēṅgā, dudhi, marrow and padwal. During the Monsoon season (June–September) green leafy vegetables, such as aḷū (Marathi: अळू), or gourds such as karle, dodka and eggplant become available. Chili peppers, carrots, tomatoes, cauliflower, French beans, śēpu, and peas become available in the cooler climate of October to February.\nCoal fired roasted young cobs of Sorghum (Jvārī) is a popular item during winter picnics to the farms.\nVegetables are typically used in making bhājīs (Indian stew). Some bhājīs are made with a single vegetable, while others are made with a combination. Bhājīs can be \"dry\" as in stir fry or \"wet\" as in the well-known curry. For example, fenugreek leaves can be used with mūg ḍāḷ or potatoes to make a dry bhājī or mixed with bēsan flour and buttermilk to make a curry preparation. Marathi bhājīs typically use gōḍa masālā, consisting of a combination of cloves, corriander powder, cumin, cinnamon, asafoetida, etc. and kanda-lasun masala made up of onion, garlic, ginger, red chilli powder, green chillies, turmeric and mustard seeds. Depending on a family's caste or specific religious tradition, onions and garlic may be excluded. For example, a number of Hindu communities from many parts of India refrain from eating onions and garlic altogether during chaturmas, which broadly equals the monsoon season.\nLeafy vegetables such as fenugreek, amaranth, beetroot, radish, dill, colocasia, spinach, ambadi, sorrel (Chuka in Marathi), chakwat, safflower (Kardai in Marathi) and tandulja are either stir-fried (pale bhaaji) or made into a soup (patal bhaaji) using buttermilk and gram flour.\nMany vegetables are used in salad preparations called koshimbirs or raita. Most of these have dahi (yogurt) as the other main ingredient. Popular Koshimbirs include those based on radish, cucumber and tomato-onion combinations. Many raita require prior boiling or roasting of the vegetable as in the case of eggplant. Popular raita include those based on carrots, eggplant, pumpkin, dudhi and beetroot respectively.\n\n### Legumes\nAlong with green vegetables, another class of popular food is various beans, either whole or split. Split beans are called dal and turned into amti (thin lentil soup), or added to vegetables such as dudhi. Dal may be cooked with rice to make khichadi. Whole beans are cooked as is or more popularly soaked in water until sprouted. Unlike Chinese cuisine, the beans are allowed to grow for only a day or two. Curries made out of sprouted beans are called usal and form an important source of proteins. The legumes popular in Maharastrian cuisine include peas, chick peas, mung, matki, urid, kidney bean, black-eyed peas, kulith and toor (also called pigeon peas). Out of the above toor and chick peas are staples. The urid bean is the base for one of the most popular types of papadum'.\n\n### Oils and fats\nPeanut oil and sunflower oil are the preferred cooking oils; however, cottonseed oil is also used. Clarified butter (called tūp) is often used for its distinct flavor. It is served with puraṇ pōḷī, varaṇa bhāt, ĉapātī, and many other dishes. Fresh homemade butter is usually served with bhākri.\n\n### Spices and herbs\nDepending on region, religion and caste, Maharashtrian food can be mild to extremely spicy. Common spices include asafoetida, turmeric, mustard seeds, coriander, cumin, dried bay leaves, and chili powder. Ingredients used especially for kala or black masala spice blend include cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, cardamom and nutmeg. Other spice blends popular in the cuisine include goda masala and Kolhapuri masala. Common herbs to impart flavor or to garnish a dish include curry leaves and coriander leaves. Many common curry recipes call for garlic, onion, ginger and green chilli pepper. Ingredients that impart sour flavor to the food include yoghurt, tomatoes, tamarind paste, lemon, and amsul skin. or unripe mangoes.\n\n### Meat and poultry\nChicken and goat are the most popular sources for meat in Maharashtrian cuisine. Eggs are popular and exclusively come from chicken sources. Beef and pork are also consumed by some sections  of Maharashtrian society. However, these do not form part of traditional Maharashtrian cuisine.\n\n### Seafood\nSeafood  is  a staple for many Konkan coastal communities and is popular in other parts of the state too. Most of the recipes are based on marine fish, prawns and crab. A distinct Malvani cuisine of mainly seafood dishes is popular. Popular fish varieties include Bombay duck, pomfret, bangda, Rawas, and surmai (kingfish).These fish are used fresh as well as dried in areas around Mumbai. Seafood recipes are prepared in different ways such as curried, Pan frying, or steaming in banana leaves.\n\n### Miscellaneous ingredients\nOther ingredients include oil seeds such as flax, karale, coconut, peanuts, almonds and cashew nuts. Peanut powder and whole nuts are used in many preparations including, chutney, koshimbir and bhaaji. More expensive nuts such as (almonds and cashew) are used mainly for sweet dishes. Flax and karale seeds are used in making dry chutneys. Traditionally, sugar cane based jaggery was used as the sweetening agent, but has been largely replaced by refined cane sugar. Fruit such as mango are used in many preparations including pickles, jams, drinks and sweet dishes. Bananas and jackfruit\nare also used in many dishes.\n\n### Typical menus\nUrban menus typically have wheat in the form of chapatis and plain rice as the main staples. Traditional rural households would have millet in form of bhakri on the Deccan plains and rice on the coast as respective staples.\nTypical breakfast items include misal, pohe, upma, sheera, sabudana khichadi and thalipeeth.

Panchforan is a common blend of five spices: jeer, ajwain, mangrail, sounf and methi, and is akin to the panchforan of Bengal.\n\n## Types of meat\nMutton and fish are the traditional non-vegetarian items. Chicken is also consumed, but it is seen as an inferior option. Mutton and fish have religious and cultural significance in the Mithila region as sacrificial offerings to goddess Durga and Kali.The Maithil Brahmin community of Mithila is one of the few non-vegetarian Brahmin communities in India, which otherwise is seen as a strictly vegetarian caste within Hinduism.\n\n## Vegetarian\nVegetarian food like saagak jhor (leafy vegetables with very thin gravy), as well as vegetables such as bitter gourd, ladyfinger, are eaten. Due to the large amount of root vegetables grown such as potato, yam, and khamarua, they are used in a number of preparations such as sanna (mashed vegetables, particularly root vegetables),  bhajia (fried vegetables in mustard oil with salt, turmeric powder and green chillies or chilli powder), and tarua (marinated or coated deep-fried vegetables). Daail-jhimni consists of fried ribbed gourd cooked with lentil and cereals. Thadia saagak teeman is a simple meal with red spinach and lentils eaten with chapati or rice. Similar to a puree, teeman is made through the process of ghontod, manual churning. It can also be made with paneer or in a non-vegetarian style with shrimp added.\n\n## Seafood\nMachh-bhat is a fish curry served with steamed rice. Machhak jhor is a traditional fish curry used in many events with the exception of some religious festivals.\n\n## Sauces and curries\nDried mango strips are widely used to give tartness in various gravies. Some sauces and gravies include:\n\nJhor — a thin mustard and coriander-based gravy with chilli\nBari — fried soft dumplings made of besan, gram flour, cooked in spicy gravy\nMaus — generally mutton or chicken or quail (tittar or battair, a small game bird), or sometimes game in spicy gravy. Generally enjoyed with malpua, sohari (chapatti) puri, or steamed rice.\nDokak jhor — commonly an oyster stew cooked with onion gravy\nArikanchanak tarkari — a preparation of marinated sun-dried colocasia leaves, steamed and cooked in mustard gravy\nGoidila — a sauce prepared from green peas and flavouring, generally eaten with rice or rotis\nKadhi bari — fried soft dumplings made of besan cooked in a spicy gravy of yogurt\nSakrauri\n\n## Breakfast\nThey would often start their day with a cup of steaming hot chai served with chura and ghugni ( black grams sautèed with onions, green chillies and other spices).  \nPoori – aloo dum, a potato dish, is a breakfast item common to have along with a sweet dish, jilebi (also known as jalewi, roundels of deep-fried fermented flour batter dipped in sugar syrup). Apart from that there are several other items that are common for breakfast including chini wala roti, pua, pachhua pu (flour pancake), and suzi ke halwa (semolina porridge), mith makhaan, makhan ke bhooja (salted makhan).\n\n## Snacks and desserts\nSome snacks include:\n\nChure ka bhujia (beaten rice fried with sliced onion, chopped green chillies and green peas)\nMakai ke lawa (popped corn)\nMasalgar murhi (rice pops mixed with chopped green chillies, onion, coriander leaf, salt and a few drops of mustard oil)\nJhilli (jalebi-like salted batter made of besan flour)\nSamosas (singhara)\nLaunglati (langlatti)\nKachari\nPyaaji\nSweet foods are also popular. Varieties of kheer are a common dessert, including makhank kheer which is prepared with lotus seeds, milk and dried nuts. Malpua is popular and has a traditional Mithila preparation that differs from that of north India. Both are prepared from a flour batter; in north India after deep frying they are dipped in sugar syrup, while in Mithila the batter itself is sweetened and it is a dry preparation which can be stored for two to three days. There are also sweet preserves made out of fruit pulps such as ammath (layered mango pulp sun-dried and cut into small chunks), kumhar ke murabba, papita ke murabba, and dhatrikak murabba. Laddoo, khaja, chandrakala, rasgulla, and other desserts are common.\n\n## Traditional dishes\nSome traditional Maithil dishes are:\n\nDahi-Chura\nVegetable of Arikanch\nKadhi bari\nGhooghni\nTarua\nTilkor Tarua\nBada\nBadee\nMaachh\nMutton\nIrhar\nPurakiya\nMakhan Payas\nAnarasa\nBagiya\nSattuwa varal puri\nBhuswa\n\n## See also\nIndian cuisine\nMurabba\n\n\n== References ==",

The word makki is derived from Sanskrit 'markaka' and roti from Sanskrit 'rotīka'.\n\n## Mode of serving\nMakki ki roti is eaten in many parts of India, but has been portrayed as a centuries-old part of Punjabi cuisine.\nMakki ki roti is often served with warming winter dishes based on greens (saag), such as sarson ka saag and channa ka saag. In Punjab and neighbouring areas it is also eaten with maah (urad) daal. Dogras have folk songs that mention makki di roti. Maize food items are also common in Rajasthan, including  maize roti; maize is part of the staple diet of Bishnois of Rajasthan and Haryana. In Uttar Pradesh, maize roti is also eaten with ghee, butter, jaggery and pickles. In Gujarat, this dish is also known as makai no rotlo.\n\n## See also\nList of breads\nCorn tortilla\nTalo (food)\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\n\n\"This winter, Makki ki Roti is out of reach\".

Consequently, Malagasy cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Prior to 1650\nAustronesian seafarers are believed to have been the first humans to settle on the island, arriving between 100 and 500 CE. In their outrigger canoes they carried food staples from home including rice, plantains, taro, and water yam. Sugarcane, ginger, sweet potatoes, pigs and chickens were also probably brought to Madagascar by these first settlers, along with coconut and banana. \nThe first concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast.  Upon arrival, early settlers practiced tavy (swidden, \"slash-and-burn\" agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of crops. They also gathered honey, fruits, bird and crocodile eggs, mushrooms, edible seeds and roots, and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice.\nGame was regularly hunted and trapped in the forests, including frogs, snakes, lizards, hedgehogs and tenrecs, tortoises, wild boars, insects, larvae, birds and lemurs.  The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus. Early Malagasy communities may have eaten the eggs and—less commonly—the meat of Aepyornis maximus, the world's largest bird, which remained widespread throughout Madagascar as recently as the 17th century. \nWhile several theories have been proposed to explain the decline and eventual extinction of Malagasy megafauna, clear evidence suggests that hunting by humans and destruction of habitats through slash-and-burn agricultural practices were key factors. \nAlthough it has been illegal to hunt or trade any of the remaining species of lemur since 1964, these endangered animals continue to be hunted for immediate local consumption in rural areas or to supply the demand for exotic bush meat at some urban restaurants.\n\nAs more virgin forest was lost to tavy, communities increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600 CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. \nRice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.\nZebu, a form of humped cattle, were introduced to the island around 1000 CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought sorghum, goats, possibly Bambara groundnut, and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted a major part of the pastoralists' diet. \nZebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo (ruled 1575–1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured polities in the highlands.\n\nFoods were commonly prepared by boiling in water (at first using green bamboo as a vessel, and later clay or iron pots), roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals. Fermentation was also used to create curds from milk, develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey, sugar cane juice or other local plants. \nThe techniques of sun curing (drying), smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called kitoza ([kiˈtuzə̥]) and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.\n\nBy the 16th century, centralized kingdoms had emerged on the west coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The Merina sovereigns celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath (fandroana). For this ceremony, a beef confit called jaka ([ˈdzakə̥]) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with suet, then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and drizzled with honey, a preparation known as tatao ([taˈtau̯]). \nAccording to oral history, King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina. Ralambo's father, King Andriamanelo, is credited with introducing the marriage tradition of the vodiondry ([vudiˈuɳɖʳʲ]) or \"rump of the sheep,\" wherein the most favored cut of meat—the hindquarters—was offered by the groom to the parents of the bride-to-be at an engagement ceremony. \nIn contemporary Malagasy society the terminology persists but families are more likely to offer symbolic coins in place of an offering of food.\n\n### 1650–1800\nThe advent of the trans-Atlantic slave trade increased maritime trade at Malagasy ports, including food products. In 1696, a trading vessel en route to the American colonies reportedly took a stock of local Malagasy rice to Charleston, South Carolina, where the grain formed the basis of the plantation industry. Trading ships brought crops from the Americas—such as sweet potato, tomato, maize, peanuts, tobacco and lima beans—to Madagascar in the 16th and 17th centuries; cassava arrived after 1735 from a French colony at nearby Réunion Island. \nThese products were first cultivated in coastal areas nearest to their ports of arrival, but soon spread throughout the island; within 100 years of their introduction they were widespread throughout the central highlands. Similarly, pineapple and citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, consumed by sailors to ward off scurvy on long cross-Atlantic trips, were introduced at coastal Malagasy ports. Local cultivation began soon afterward.\nThe prickly pear cactus or raketa ([raˈketə̥]), also known in southern Madagascar as sakafon-drano ([saˈkafuˈɳɖʳanʷ]) or \"water food\", was brought from the New World to the French settlement at Fort Dauphin in 1769 by Frenchman Count Dolisie de Maudave. The plant spread throughout the southern part of the island, where it became a fundamental food crop for Mahafaly and Bara pastoralists. Consuming six or so of the fruits of this plant preempted the need to drink water, and once the spines had been removed, the cladodes of the plant would nourish and hydrate the zebu cattle they tended. The introduction of this plant enabled the southern pastoralists to become more sedentary and efficient herders, thus boosting population density and cattle count in the region.\n\n### 1800–1896\nThe 18th century in the central highlands was characterized by increasing population density and consequent famines, aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina. \nAt the turn of the 19th century, King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810) successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule, then used slaves and forced labor—exacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material payment—to systematically work the irrigated rice fields around Antananarivo. In this way, he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island. Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats, dried maize, salt, dried cassava and various fruits. Rice cakes, including mofo gasy ([ˈmufʷˈɡasʲ]) and menakely ([menə̥ˈkelʲ]), were also sold by market vendors. \nBy this period, coastal cuisine had likewise evolved: early 19th-century voyagers reported eating dishes on Île Sainte-Marie prepared with curry powder (including a spiced rice resembling biryani) and drinking coffee and tea.\nAndrianampoinimerina's son, Radama I, succeeded in uniting nearly the entire island under his rule, and established the Kingdom of Madagascar. A line of Merina monarchs continued to govern the island until its colonization by the French in 1896.\n\nUnder the Kingdom of Madagascar, plantations were established for the production of crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19th century, when more intensive cultivation for export began. \nVanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's principal export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30 years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop until the end of the monarchy.\n\nDuring Merina royal festivals, the hanim-pito loha ([amˈpitʷˈlu]) were eaten. These were seven dishes said to be the most desirable in the realm. Among these dishes were voanjobory ([vwandzˈburʲ], Bambara groundnut), amalona ([aˈmalnə̥], eel), vorivorinkena ([vurvurˈkenə̥], beef tripe), Ravitoto ([ravˈtutʷ], grated cassava leaves) and vorontsiloza ([vurntsʲˈluzə̥], turkey), each cooked with pork and usually ginger, garlic, onion and tomato; Romazava ([rumaˈzavə̥], a stew of beef and greens) and varanga ([vaˈraŋɡə̥], shredded roast beef) completed the list. \nColonization of Madagascar by the French meant the end of the Malagasy monarchy and its elaborate feasts, but the traditions of this elegant cuisine were preserved in the home, where these dishes are eaten regularly. They are also served in many restaurants throughout the island.\n\n### 1896–1960\nFrench colonial rule began in 1896 and introduced a number of innovations to local cuisines. Certain new food names derived from the French language—then the dominant language of the state—became widespread. Baguettes were popularized among cosmopolitan urbanites, as were a variety of French pastries and desserts such as cream horns, mille-feuille, croissants and chocolat chaud (hot chocolate).\nThe French also introduced foie gras, now produced locally, and popularized a dish known in the highlands as composé: a cold macaroni salad mixed with blanched vegetables based on the French macédoine de légumes. \nThe French established plantations for the cultivation of a variety of cash crops, including not only those already exploited in the 19th century, but new foreign fruits, vegetables and livestock, with varying degrees of success. Tea, coffee, vanilla, coconut oil and spices became successful exports.  Coconut became a regular ingredient in coastal cuisine, and vanilla began to be used in sauces for poultry and seafood dishes.\n\nAlthough a handful of Chinese settlers had arrived in Madagascar towards the end of the reign of Queen Ranavalona III, the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an announcement by General Joseph Gallieni, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000 Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina. \nChinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including riz cantonais (Chinese fried rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style noodle soup), misao (fried noodles), pao (hum bao) and nems (fried egg rolls).\nBy the 1880s, a community of roughly 200 Indian traders had been established at Mahajanga, a port on the north-west coast of Madagascar, near Bombetoka Bay at the mouth of the Betsiboka River. Thirty years later the population of Indians in Madagascar had increased to over 4,000, concentrated along the trading ports of the northwestern coast. \nThese early Indian communities popularized curries and biryanis throughout the region. Khimo in particular, a dish based on the Indian keema, became a specialty of Mahajanga. Indian samosas (sambos) soon became a popular street food in most parts of Madagascar, where they may also be known by the name tsaky telozoro ([ˈtsakʲteluˈzurʷ], \"three-cornered snack\").\nWhile French innovations enriched the cuisine in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French introduction of the prickly pear cactus in the 18th century, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves during the dry season between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.\n\n## Contemporary cuisine\nThroughout the country, rice is considered the preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet in all but the most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. \nOutside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation.\n\n### Rice (vary)\nSince at least 1915, rice (vary) has been the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. James Sibree noted that the verb \"to eat a meal\" in the Malagasy language is commonly mihinam-bary —literally, to eat rice. Rice may be prepared with varying amounts of water to produce a fluffy dry rice (vary maina, [ˌvarʲ ˈmajnə̥]) eaten with some kind of accompaniment (laoka) in sauce. It may also be prepared with extra water to produce a soupy rice porridge called vary sosoa ([ˌvarʲ suˈsu]) which is typically eaten for breakfast or prepared for the sick. Vary sosoa may be accompanied with a dry laoka such as kitoza, smoked strips of zebu meat. A popular variation, vary amin'anana ([ˈvarʲ ˌjamʲˈnananə̥]), is a traditional porridge made with rice, meat and chopped greens. \nDuring a highland famadihana (reburial ceremony), a special kind of rice called vary be menaka ([ˈvarʲ beˈmenakə̥], \"rice with much fat\") is rice served with fatty chunks of beef or preferably, highly fatty chunks of pork.\n\n### Accompaniment (laoka)\nThe accompaniment served with rice is called laoka in the highlands dialect, the official version of the Malagasy language. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. \nLaoka include diverse ingredients. Some representative examples include Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; trondro gasy ([ˌtʂundʐʷ ˈɡasʲ], various freshwater fish); shredded cassava leaves with peanuts, beef or pork; henan'omby ([henˈnumbʲ], beef) or akoho ([aˈkuː], chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called ritra [ˈritʂə̥]); and various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers. \nA variety of local greens such as anamamy ([anaˈmamʲ], Morelle greens), anamafaitra (Malagasy pronunciation: [anaˈmafai̯ʈʳ], Martin greens) and particularly anamalao or brèdes mafana (Malagasy pronunciation: [anamaˈlau̯], paracress)—distinguished by the mildly numbing effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside anandrano (Malagasy pronunciation: [ananˈɖʳanʷ], watercress) and anatsonga (Malagasy pronunciation: [anaˈtsuŋɡə̥], bok choy). \nIn the arid south and west, such as among the Bara or Tandroy peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, millet and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.\nGarlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, and salt are the most common ingredients used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or turmeric may also be used. A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked. The most common and basic condiment, sakay ([saˈkai̯]), is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper. \nIndian-style condiments made of pickled mango, lemon, and other fruits (known as achards or lasary [laˈsarʲ]), are a coastal specialty; in the highlands, lasary often refers to a salad of green beans, cabbage, carrots and onion in a vinaigrette sauce, popular as a side dish or as the filling of a baguette sandwich.\nRo ([ru], a broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice.  Ro-mangazafy ([rumaŋɡaˈzafʲ]) is a rich and flavorful broth made with beef, tomato and garlic that often accompanies a dry laoka. By contrast, Romatsatso ([rumaˈtsatsʷ]) is a light and relatively flavorless broth made with onion, tomato and anamamy greens served with meat or fatty poultry. Ron-akoho ([runaˈku]), a broth made with chicken and ginger, is a home remedy for the common cold, while rompatsa ([rumˈpatsə̥])—a broth made with tiny dried shrimp and beef, to which sweet potato leaves and potato are often added—is traditionally eaten by new mothers to support lactation. \nThe national dish is the broth called romazava, which in its simplest form is made of beef with anamalao, anantsonga or anamamy, although ingredients such as tomato, onion and ginger are commonly added to create more complex and flavorful versions. Romazava is distinguished by its inclusion of anamalao flowers, which produce a mild analgesic effect when the broth is consumed.\n\n### Street foods\nA variety of cakes and fritters collectively known as mofo ([ˈmuf], meaning \"bread\") are available from kiosks in towns and cities across Madagascar. The most common is mofo gasy, meaning \"Malagasy bread\", which is made from a batter of sweetened rice flour poured into greased circular molds and cooked over charcoal. \nMofo gasy is a popular breakfast food and is often eaten with coffee, also sold at kiosks. In coastal areas this mofo is made with coconut milk and is known as mokary ([muˈkarʲ]). Other sweet mofo include a deep-fried doughnut called menakely and a fried dough ball called mofo baolina ([ˌmuf ˈbolː]), as well as a variety of fruit fritters, with pineapple and bananas among the most common fruits used. \nSavory mofo include ramanonaka ([ˌramaˈnunakə̥]), a mofo gasy salted and fried in lard, and a fritter flavored with chopped greens, onions, tomatoes and chilies called mofo sakay ([ˌmuf saˈkai̯], meaning \"spicy bread\").\nIn marketplaces and gas stations one may find vendors selling koba akondro ([kubaˈkundʐʷ]), a sweet made by wrapping a batter of ground peanuts, mashed bananas, honey and corn flour in banana leaves and steaming or boiling the small cakes until the batter has set. \nPeanut brittle, dried bananas, balls of tamarind paste rolled in colored sugar, deep-fried wonton-type dough strings called kaka pizon ([kaka pizõ], meaning \"pigeon droppings\") also eaten in neighboring Reunion Island, and home-made yogurts, are all commonly sold on the street. In rural areas, steamed cassava or sweet potatoes are eaten, occasionally with fresh or sweetened condensed milk.\n\n### Desserts\nTraditionally, fresh fruit may be eaten after a meal as a dessert. Fresh sugarcane may also be chewed as a treat. A great variety of temperate and tropical fruits are grown locally and may be enjoyed fresh or sprinkled with sugar. \nTemperate fruits found in Madagascar include but are not limited to apples, lemons, pumpkins, watermelon, oranges, cherries and strawberries. \nAmong the many tropical fruits commonly eaten in Madagascar are coconut, tamarind, mango, pineapple, avocado, passion fruit, and loquats, locally called pibasy ([piˈbasʲ]). Guava, longans, lychees, persimmon and \"pok-pok\" (also called voanantsindrana [vunˈtsinɖʳanə̥]), a fruit similar to a physalis, are common, while on the west coast the fruit of the baobab tree is eaten during the brief period when it becomes available near the end of the rainy season.\nMadagascar is known for its cocoa and vanilla, much of which are exported. In the coastal areas of Madagascar or in upscale inland restaurants, vanilla may be used to prepare savory sauces for poultry.\nKoban-dravina ([ˌkubanˈɖʳavʲnə̥]) or koba ([ˈkubə̥]) is a Malagasy specialty made by grinding together peanuts and brown sugar, then enveloping the mixture in a sweetened rice flour paste to produce a cylindrical bundle. The bundle is wrapped in banana leaves and boiled for 24 to 48 hours or longer until the sugar becomes caramelized and the peanuts have softened. The resulting cake is served in thin slices. \nBonbon coco is a popular candy made from shredded coconut cooked with caramelized sugar and formed into chewy balls or patties. A firm, cake-like coconut milk pudding known as godro-godro ([ɡuɖʳˈɡuɖʳʷ]) is a popular dessert also found in Comoros. \nFrench pastries and cakes are very popular across the island and may be purchased at the many pâtisseries found in towns and cities throughout Madagascar.\n\n### Beverages\nRanon'ampango ([ˌranʷnamˈpaŋɡʷ]) and ranovola ([ranʷˈvulə̥]), are the most common and traditional beverages in Madagascar. Both are names for a drink made by adding hot water to the toasted rice left sticking to the interior of its cooking pot. This drink is a sanitary and flavorsome alternative to fresh water.\nA variety of other drinks are produced locally. Coffee is grown in the eastern part of the island and has become a standard breakfast drink, served black or with sweetened condensed milk at street-side kiosks. \nBlack tea, occasionally flavored with vanilla, and herbal teas—particularly lemongrass and lemon bush (ravin'oliva [ˌravʲnoˈlivə̥])—are popular. Juices are made from guava, passion fruit, pineapple, tamarind, baobab, and other fruit. \nFresh milk is a luxury, and locally produced yogurts, ice cream or sweetened condensed milk mixed with hot water are the most common dairy sources of calcium. \nCola and orange soft drinks are produced locally, as is Bonbon Anglais, a local sweet lemon soda. Coca-Cola products are widely consumed throughout the island.\nNumerous alcoholic beverages are produced for local consumption and limited export. The local pilsner, Three Horses Beer, is ubiquitous. Wine is produced in the southern highlands around Fianarantsoa, and rum (toaka gasy [ˌtokə̥ ˈɡasʲ]) is widely produced and can be either drunk neat, flavored with exotic fruits and spices to produce rhum arrangé or blended with coconut milk to make a punch coco cocktail. The most traditional form of rum, called betsabetsa [ˌbetsəˈbetsə̥], is made from fermented sugarcane juice. Rum serves a ritual purpose in many parts of Madagascar, where it is traditional to throw the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room as an offering and gesture of respect to the ancestors. \nAt social gatherings it is common for alcoholic beverages to be accompanied with savory, fried snacks known collectively as tsakitsaky, commonly including pan-fried peanuts, potato chips, nems, sambos and kaka pizon.\n\n## See also\nAfrican cuisine\nAgriculture in Madagascar\nList of African cuisines\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

Although there are various types of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. A typical meal consists of a plate of rice for each person on the table. Dishes are meant to be shared among the diners; each dish is provided with a spoon, and each diner spoons the dishes of their choosing onto their rice plate.\nFood is eaten delicately with the fingers of the right hand, never with the left (which is used for personal ablutions); Malays rarely use utensils.\n\n## History and influences\nIt is uncertain when the Malay culinary traditions took shape, but the earliest record of the tradition is from the 15th century when the Malacca Sultanate became the important trade centre in the Malay Archipelago. The most important legacy of Malacca derived from its involvement in the spice trade, its openness to the ingredients and culinary techniques introduced by foreigners (notably the Arabs, Persians, Chinese and Indians) and its cultivation of a rich eclectic gastronomy. Malacca was also a catalyst for the development of two other rich and distinctive culinary cultures: the fusion of Malay with Chinese and European traditions, in cuisines respectively known as Nyonya and Eurasian. In the centuries before and after Malacca, there were other non-Malay groups, from Buginese and Javanese to Minangkabau, who were absorbed into Malay society at different times, aided by similarity in lifestyle and a common religion, and had varying degrees of influence on Malay food.\nIt is important to understand the nuance and differences of what makes a dish Malay, which is intertwined with the differences between the concept of Malay as an ethnic group or as a race. In Indonesia, Malay cuisine more specifically refers to the cuisine of ethnic Malay people who traditionally inhabit the east coast of Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and coastal Borneo. In Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and outside the Malay Archipelago (such as Sri Lanka and South Africa) however, the term \"Malay cuisine\" often takes a broader scope, which includes the culinary traditions of other neighbouring common Austronesian peoples, often including Minangkabaus, Javanese and Bugis, or even their fusion derivatives.\nNasi lemak, rice cooked in rich coconut milk, is probably the most common and best liked dish, ubiquitous in Malay towns and villages. Nasi lemak is considered Malaysia's national dish. Another example is ketupat or nasi himpit, compressed rice cooked in palm leaves. It is eaten especially often during Hari Raya. Various meats and vegetables can be made into gulai or kari, a type of curry dish with variations of spice mixtures that display an Indian influence long present in Malay cuisine. Since most Malays are Muslims, Malay cuisine rigorously observes Islamic halal dietary law.  Protein intake is mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb, and also includes poultry and fish. Pork, non-halal meat, and alcohol are prohibited. Laksa, a fusion of Malay and Chinese cuisine, is also frequently served. Malay cuisine has also adopted some neighbouring food traditions, such as rendang, adopted from Minangkabau cuisine, in Sumatra, and nasi ulam from Betawi cuisine and satays from Javanese cuisine in Java. However, the Malays have developed distinctive tastes and recipes.\nMalay cuisine has also spread outside the Malay Archipelago and influenced other cuisine there. Bobotie is a South African dish with its origins in Cape Malay. It consists of spiced minced meat baked with an egg-based topping. Of the many dishes common to South Africa, bobotie is perhaps closest to being the national dish because it is not commonly found in any other country. The recipe originates from the Dutch East India Company colonies in Batavia, with the name derived from the Indonesian bobotok. In other countries, kalu dodol is a Sri Lankan dessert with Sri Lankan Malay origins. It consists of kithul jaggery (from the sap of the toddy palm), rice flour and coconut milk.\n\n## Terminology\nNearly every culture and language has contributed to the culinary language, including Malay with its own food terminology embracing its preparation, methods of cooking, and numerous food names. Malay food terminology has been shaped by cultural transmission over many generations. Traditionally Malay parents would pass down the skills and processes of cooking to their children through daily cooking activities as well as traditional events, including wedding ceremonies.\n\n### Food preparation\nIn Malay food preparation, the ingredients used are often described as spicy and flavorful as it is a melting pot of spices, herbs and roots. Strong, tangy and flavorful fresh herbs, spices and ingredients such as serai (lemongrass), pandan (screwpine), kemangi (a type of basil), kesum (polygonum), buah pala (nutmeg), kunyit (turmeric) and bunga kantan (wild ginger buds), biji sawi (mustard seeds) and halba (fenugreek) are often used. There are also a number of terms used for the equipment and utensils used for food preparation. Traditional cooking equipment includes several types of grinders called lesung batu (pestle and mortar), batu giling (stone roller), and the batu boh (mill) used for preparing spices and pastes. Vegetables are diced on a landas (wooden cutting board); a coconut scraper or kukur niyur is indispensable in making both curries and sweets. Pastries are also made for desserts, and for this a torak (rolling pin) and papan penorak (pastry board) are considered essential.\n\n### Cooking methods\nTraditional cooking methods in Malay cuisine are quite similar to life in Malay villages, slow and relaxed, as most Malay food is cooked on low heat for a long time compared to Chinese food. There are numerous methods of cooking which consist of dry and moist methods. Tumis (using a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow pan over relatively high heat), salai (food smoked or grilled with the ingredients often cut into pieces or thinly sliced to facilitate fast cooking), sangai (food, mainly dried spices, fried without oil), and layur (warmed over low heat to dry) are examples of terms for dry-heat cooking methods. On the other hand, moist-heat cooking methods includes terms such as tanak (cooking in a pot, especially rice), jerang (boiling or simmering), celur (blanching or dipping food such as vegetables into hot water) and reneh (simmering or boiling food).\n\n### Characteristics\nAs defined by Ainuddin, Malay food has five characteristics: \n\nIt is rich in herbs and spices;\nCoconut milk is one of the main ingredients;\nIt is usually spicy;\nMeat is usually stewed with a thick gravy; and\nFried fish and seafood are usually seasoned with turmeric powder.\n\n## Regional cuisine variations\n\n\n### Brunei\nBruneian Malay cuisine is often spicy and commonly eaten with either rice or noodles. Beef rendang, nasi lemak and pajeri nanas are frequently served in Brunei. Among the few dishes peculiar to Brunei is ambuyat, a sticky ball of flavourless sago starch, which is wrapped around a bamboo fork and dipped into a spicy and sour gravy.\nNasi katok, which literally means 'knock rice', is a commonly served meal which consists of plain rice, fried chicken and sambal, a spicy relish made from ground chilli peppers and a variety of secondary ingredients including shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, lime juice, vinegar and anchovies. Nasi katok is traditionally served wrapped in brown paper.\n\n### Indonesia\nThe cuisine of Malay Indonesians spread on the east coast of Sumatra and Kalimantan, primarily West Kalimantan. Because of the close ethnic kinship and proximity to Malaysian Malays, many dishes are shared between the two countries. For example, nasi lemak and nasi ulam are considered native dishes of Riau and Jambi. Malay cuisine also shares many similarities with the neighboring Minangkabau cuisine of West Sumatra, Palembangese cuisine of South Sumatra and Acehnese cuisine of Aceh, such as sharing gulai, asam pedas, kari, lemang, nasi minyak, pempek, pindang, rendang and roti canai. This is due to the fact that the Minangkabaus are culturally closely related to the Malays. Malay Indonesian cuisine has also been influenced by Arab Indonesian, Betawi, Chinese Indonesian, Indian Indonesian and Javanese cuisine.\nOtak-otak is a dish involving fish pieces wrapped in banana leaves. The grilled fish cake is made of ground fish mixed with tapioca starch and spices.\n\nTempoyak is a fermented durian sauce and sambal belacan is a Malay-style sambal made of fresh chillies and toasted belacan in a stone mortar. Both are familiar condiments in Sumatra.\nOther Malay Indonesian dishes include acar, amplang, ayam goreng, ayam pansuh, ayam penyet, ayam percik, begedil, bihun goreng, bobotok, bubur asyura, bubur cha cha, bubur lambuk, bubur pedas, cincalok, epok-epok, various gulai, ikan bakar, various ikan patin dishes, kangkung belacan, kemplang, ketupat, kwetiau goreng, various laksa, lepat, lontong, martabak, mi celor, mi goreng, mi kari, mi rebus, nasi ambeng, nasi briyani, various nasi goreng, nasi kari, nasi kebuli, pekasam, rojak, roti jala, roti john, roti tisu, sambal sotong, samosa, satay, sayur lodeh, various siput gonggong dishes, soto, soto mi, sup ikan, sup kambing, sup rusa, tauhu goreng, tekwan, terang bulan and ulam.\n\n### Malaysia\nMalaysian Malay cuisine bears many similarities to Malay Indonesian cuisine. It has also been influenced by Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese and Minangkabau cuisine. Many Malay dishes revolve around the rempah, which is usually sauteed in oil to draw out its flavours to form the base of a dish. A dipping relish called sambal is an essential accompaniment for most Malay dishes.\nNasi lemak is rice cooked in rich coconut milk and considered Malaysia's national dish.\nThe drink sirap bandung consists of evaporated or condensed milk flavoured with rose syrup, giving it a pink colour. The drink is an adaptation of rose milk from India.\nOther Malay dishes in Malaysia include apam balik, ayam goreng, ayam masak merah, ayam pansuh, ayam percik, bubur pedas, char kway teow, cincalok, ikan bakar, various kari, karipap, kebebe, kerabu, keropok lekor, kerutuk daging, various laksa, Maggi goreng, masak lemak, mee bandung, mee Jawa, mee kolo, mee siam, mee soto, mee wantan, nasi ambeng, nasi beriani, nasi dagang, nasi kerabu, nasi goreng, nasi paprik, nasi tumpang, pek nga, roti canai, roti john, satay, taugeh ayam, tempoyak and ulam.\n\n### Singapore\nSituated between Malaysia and Indonesia, Singaporean Malay dishes are influenced by the food of the neighbouring Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and the Riau Islands. Despite absorbing regional influences, it tends to be adapted to local tastes and differ from its counterparts in neighbouring countries. Hence, Singaporean Malay cuisine features a unique set of influences, especially from Minangkabau and Javanese cuisine.\nDendeng is a thinly sliced dried meat. It is preserved through a mixture of sugar and spices and dried via a frying process and shows Minangkabau influences.\nOther Malay Singaporean dishes include assam pedas, bakso, curry puff, gulai daun ubi, Katong laksa, ketupat, lemak siput, mee siam, mee goreng, naan, nasi goreng, nasi lemak, nasi padang, rojak bandung, roti john, sambal stingray, satay, satay bee hoon, soto and sup tulang.\n\n### South Africa\nCape Malay cuisine is a tradition of the Cape Malay people in South Africa. It has been influenced by Malay and Javanese cuisine. Thus, Cape Malay influence has brought spicy curries, sambals, pickled fish and a variety of fish stews to South Africa. Adaptations of traditional foods such as bobotie and sosatie are staples in many South African homes. Faldela Williams wrote three cookbooks, including the Cape Malay Cookbook, which was instrumental in preserving the cultural traditions of Cape Malay cuisine.\nSosatie is a traditional Cape Malay dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers. The term is derived from sate (skewered meat) and saus (spicy sauce). To prepare it, mutton chunks are marinated overnight in fried onions, chillies, garlic, curry leaves and tamarind juice, then threaded on skewers and either pan-fried or grilled.\nCape Malay yellow rice, a sweet dish made with raisins, cinnamon and sugar, also has its origins in Cape Malay cookery, often referred to as Cape Malay yellow rice.\nOther Cape Malay dishes include biryani, boeber, chutney, falooda, frikkadel, koesister, roti, sambals, samoosa and tomato bredie.\n\n### Sri Lanka\nSri Lankan Malay cuisine has played a significant role in shaping Sri Lankan cuisine. Achcharu is a dish that originates from the local Malay community and is now widely popular among all ethnic groups in the country. It is a selection of vegetables in a pickled sauce and blends sweet, sour and spicy flavours. Mee goreng and nasi goreng are also popular, a result of cultural influences from Indonesia and the country's Malay community.\nOther Sri Lankan Malay dishes include varieties of curry, ekor sop, kalu dodol, sambals and watalappam.\n\n## List of Malay dishes\n\n\n### Dishes\nAcar, pickled vegetables or fruits with dried chilli, peanuts, and spices\nAmbuyat, a dish derived from the interior trunk of the sago palm.

    "text": "# Malaysian Indian cuisine\n\nMalaysian Indian cuisine, or the cooking of the ethnic Indian communities in Malaysia, consists of adaptations of authentic dishes from India, as well as original creations inspired by the diverse food culture of Malaysia. Because the vast majority of Malaysia's Indian community are of South Indian descent, and are mostly ethnic Tamils who are descendants of immigrants from a historical region which consists of the modern Indian state of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka's Northern Province, much of Malaysian Indian cuisine is predominantly South Indian-inspired in character and taste. \nA typical Malaysian Indian dish is likely to be seasoned with curry leaves and whole and powdered spice, and to contain fresh coconut in various forms. Ghee is still widely used for cooking, although vegetable oils and refined palm oils are now commonplace in home kitchens. Before a meal it is customary to wash hands as cutlery is often not used while eating, with the exception of a serving spoon for each respective dish.\n\n## History\nSee influence of Indian cuisine in Malaysia, due to Indianisation as part of Greater India as Malaysia and Southeast Asia have been historically influenced by the Indian culture, religion and cuisine.\n\n## Cuisine culture\n\n\n### Banana leaf\nAs nearly 90 percent of Malaysian Indians originated from South India, banana leaf is used traditionally to eat food from. The banana leaf meal is famous in Malaysia. With rice at the center and different accompaniments like pickle, fried meat or vegetable, papadam (Indian fries made of lentils), it's a feast by itself and various curries that are served around this is not just a treat for the eyes but also to the palate. Etiquette is important when it comes to a banana leaf rice meal. One part involves the practice of serving, namely the way the leaf is placed before a diner and where the food is placed on the leaf itself. Eating with one's hands is a must.\nThe folding aspect of the banana leaf is also contentious with many believing it to be a rating system – fold towards one to indicate satisfaction or away to indicate dissatisfaction.\n\n### Chettinad cuisine\nChettinad cuisine, the cuisine of the Chettinad region in Tamil Nadu, is very popular and available at specialty restaurants. The traditional cookery of the Chettiar community is distinct from the predominantly vegetarian fare of Tamil cuisine as it is heavily based on robustly spiced meat preparations. Coconut milk is sparingly used in favour of liberal quantities of onions and tomatoes to flavour and thicken curries.\n\n### Mamak culture\nMamak dishes have developed a distinctly Malaysian style. Available throughout the country, the omnipresent mamak stalls or restaurants are particularly popular among the locals as they offer a wide range of food and some outlets are open 24 hours a day.

However, although the vast majority of Indian Malaysians are descendants of immigrants from southern India, Malaysian Indian cuisine has a mixture of north-south Indian and Sri Lankan diversity that can be differentiated by drier or wetter curry dish preparation.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Origins\nMalaysian cuisine has developed over the region's history. Although the modern state of Malaysia did not exist until 1963, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 1400s, during the time of the Malacca Sultanate. Malaysian cuisine is a mixture of various food cultures from around the Malay archipelago, such as India, China, the Middle East, and several European countries. This diverse culinary culture stems from Malaysia's diverse culture and colonial past. The cuisine was developed as a melange between local and foreign. In the 15th century, the region now known as Malaysia became an important passageway for maritime trade. Passing through Malaysia were Arab traders who brought spices from the Middle East, as well as Portuguese, Dutch, and English colonists and traders who introduced food staples such as peanuts, pineapples, avocado, tomatoes, squash and pumpkin. During the 19th century in the period of British colonial rule, many Indian and Chinese laborers were brought to Malaysia, contributing to the diversity of tastes in Malaysian cuisine.\n\n### Cultural and regional influences\nBeing a multicultural country, Malaysians have over the years adopted each other's dishes to suit the taste buds of their own culture. For instance, Malaysians of Chinese descent have adapted the Indian curry, and made it more dilute and less spicy to suit their taste. Chinese noodles have been crossed with Indian and Malay tastes and thus Malay fried noodles and Indian fried noodles were born. Malaysians have also adapted famous dishes from neighbouring countries, or those with strong cultural and religious ties, and in the absence of an established community from said countries have made it completely their own, a notable example being tom yam, one of Thailand's most well-known dishes\nAfter migrating south of the border, Thai tom yam adopts the visual characteristics of a Malaysian Assam gravy, with a flavor profile that is sweet, sour, and spicy. It is thickened with pounded chili paste, which also gives it a vivid orange-red color. Tamarind is often used instead of lime juice as the souring agent, and dried chilies, rather than fresh ones, are used to provide a fiery kick. Malay-style tom yam soup tends to be heavily seafood-based, whereas in Chinese-style eateries, the broth's spiciness is toned down and it is usually served as a base for noodle soup.\nAcross the sea from Peninsular Malaysia, on Borneo island, lie the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Traditional lifestyles and limited roads still predominate outside of the major cities, especially in Sarawak, where rivers are the only major highways for much of the inland population. The jungles of Borneo are teeming with wild plants, fungi, and fruits, and its sweeping coastlines and many large rivers provide an abundance of seafood and freshwater fish fit for the dinner table. A rich variety of traditional food has been developed by Borneo's many tribes and indigenous groups over the centuries; much of it is healthy food, consisting of foraged (now increasingly cultivated due to modernisation) and fermented foods. Because much of the region was once under the Brunei Sultanate's thalassocracy, the Bruneian Malay people have left a lasting culinary influence, particularly on the cookery of the coastal Muslim communities of East Malaysia. According to the source paper written in 2006, the Malaysian food industrial sector accounted for about 14% of the total manufacturing energy consumption.\nHistorically speaking, fresh produce is often scarce for hunter-gatherer nomadic tribes around the world, thus it is usually preserved out of necessity for important events and festivals. The tribal peoples of Sabah and Sarawak are no different; most of them have developed techniques for curing, fermenting or preserving their supplies of fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. For example, during festive occasions the Murut people of Sabah would serve tamba (jeruk in the Malay language) made from fresh raw wild boar or river fish, which is stuffed in bamboo tubes along with rice and salt and left to ferment for a few weeks, a technique which is also practised by the Lun Bawang people across the border in Sarawak. Fermented products are also frequently used as a cooking ingredient besides eaten on their own. Dayak households in Sarawak may saute their version of fermented meat with garlic and tapioca leaves (either fresh or pickled), and fermented  tempoyak is a popular cooking seasoning.\nThe production and consumption of traditional liquor play an important cultural role for the non-Muslim peoples of East Malaysia. Alcoholic drinks made from rice is the most common form, as well as the widely available. In Sabah, the Penampang Kadazan lihing is perhaps the most well known. Yet due to the historical lack of a standardised Kadazandusun language used and understood statewide, ethnic groups from other districts in Sabah have very different names for similar fermented rice-based drinks: hiing (certain Dusun languages), kinomol, segantang, kinarung, kinopi, linahas, and even tapai To add to the confusion, tapai proper as understood by most Peninsular Malaysians is a fermented sweet and sour rice paste served as a snack or dessert, although further fermentation of the tapai to produce alcoholic drinks is possible. The preferred party drink of the Murut, made from the tuber of the cassava or tapioca plant, is also called tapai. The Iban of Sarawak call their rice wine tuak, which must not be confused with Sabahan talak, which is a hard liquor made from rice. To the native peoples of Sarawak, tuak may also refer to any alcoholic drink made from fermenting any carbohydrate-rich substance besides rice.\n\n## Staples\n\n\n### Rice\nRice (Malay: nasi) is the most important staple food in Malaysia. According to Indonesian-born food and cookery writer Sri Owen, there is some evidence for rice cultivation found in the state of Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo dated 2300 BC, and about 900 years of history for the state of Kelantan in West Malaysia. Today Malaysia produces about seventy percent of the amount of rice it needs to support itself and the rest is imported. This is a matter of policy as the government believes that national resources can be used more profitably instead of attempting to achieve self-sufficiency with rice production; the prevalent attitude is that revenue generated from its industries enables the country to import up to half the rice it needs. Nevertheless, the government is fully committed and involved in planning, allocating resources and managing subsidies for the rice farming industry. The state of Kedah is considered the \"rice bowl\" (Malay: jelapang padi) of the country, accounting for about half of Malaysia's total production of rice.\nPlain steamed white rice, to be served with side dishes of meat or vegetables, is typically prepared with an electric rice cooker at home. Some households and food establishments prefer to cook rice on a stove top with the absorption method or the rapid-boil method. Compressed rice, called nasi himpit, is another method of preparing and cooking rice: the rice is wrapped with fronds or leaves and compressed into the form of a cylinder, which is then cooked by boiling. The rice would compress and merge during the cooking process. Compressed rice is usually eaten cold with some sort of gravy, although it may be served warm in a broth or soup. A notable variant of compressed rice prepared by the Bugis community is burasak: rice is precooked with coconut milk before it is wrapped in banana leaves and steamed until fully cooked.\nBesides the ubiquitous white rice, there are different types of locally grown and imported rice available in the market, and each type has a specific cooking method to bring out optimal results. Glutinous rice (Malay: pulut) is one example: because of its low amylose and high amylopectin content which results in a sticky texture after cooking, glutinous rice is prepared with different measurements and techniques and is not suitably interchangeable with regular rice. It is typically used for making snacks and desserts, but glutinous rice is also prepared as a savoury staple by indigenous peoples like the Orang Asli as well as the Dayak people of Borneo. Lemang is glutinous rice roasted in a hollowed bamboo tube, and is prepared for festive occasions like Ari Gawai, Hari Raya Aidilfitri, and Hari Raya Aidiladha.\nA popular dish based on rice in Malaysia is nasi lemak, rice steamed with coconut milk and pandan leaves to give it a rich fragrance. Of Malay origin, nasi lemak is very popular and frequently referred to as the national dish. It is customarily served with ikan bilis or fried anchovies, peanuts, sliced cucumber, hard-boiled eggs and sambal. Although it is often considered a breakfast dish, it is served in a variety of ways and commonly eaten at any time of day due to its versatility. For a more substantial meal, nasi lemak may be served with fried chicken, curries, or a spicy meat stew called rendang.\nCongee is a type of rice porridge or gruel popular among Malaysia's ethnic communities. It is eaten primarily as a breakfast food or late supper. It is also considered particularly suitable for the sick as a mild, easily digestible food. Congee is called bubur in Malay; 粥 written in Chinese, pronounced as zhou in Mandarin Chinese and juk in Cantonese; and kanji (கஞ்சி) in Tamil. It may be served plain with little embellishment, or cooked with ingredients like fish slices, seafood, chicken, beef, pork, vegetables, and spices. The importance and popularity of congee in the Malaysian diet is such that bubur ayam or chicken congee is a permanent fixture on the menu of Malaysian McDonald's restaurants.\n\n### Noodles\nNoodles are another popular staple, particularly in Malaysian Chinese cuisine, but used by other groups as well. Noodles such as bi hoon (米粉, Hokkien: bí-hún, Malay: bihun; rice vermicelli), kuay teow (粿條, Hokkien: kóe-tiâu) or ho fun (河粉, Cantonese: ho4 fan2; flat rice noodles), mee (麵 or 面, Hokkien: mī, Malay: mi; yellow noodles), mee suah (麵線 or 面线, Hokkien: mī-sòaⁿ; wheat vermicelli), yee meen (伊麵 or 伊面, Cantonese: ji1 min6; golden wheat noodles), dongfen (冬粉, Hokkien: tang-hún, Cantonese: dung1 fan2; cellophane noodles), Lao Shu Fen (老鼠粉, Cantonese: lou5 syu2 fan2; silver needle noodles), and others provide an alternative source of carbohydrate to a serving of rice that accompanies every meal. Stir-fried noodle dishes (Malay: mee goreng) are ubiquitous throughout Malaysia's cities, towns and villages, with numerous localised variants prepared by various ethnic communities according to their culinary traditions and preferences.\n\n### Bread\nMalaysia does not produce wheat, and all supplies are imported from wheat-producing countries. Nevertheless, Western-style white bread and Indian breads made with wheat flour like roti canai are fairly common foods or is sandwiched along with a layer of kaya between slices of untoasted white bread.\nTraditional wheat-based pleated steamed bao or pao (Chinese : 包子) is a Chinese staple which has become tightly woven into Malaysia's gastronomic fabric. Pao are found in restaurants doing brunch dim sum trade, as well as specialist Chinese kopitiam (coffee shops). Sweet fillings may include tausa, lotus seed paste, kaya, pandan, ground peanuts, and custard; savoury fillings may consist of stewed char siu (Chinese : 叉燒), chicken or pork. Malay versions (pau) may be found in night markets (pasar malam) and they are always halal, with fillings of curried potato, chicken or beef. Some variants have a quail egg in the middle in addition to the curry.\nOven-baked buns are also available in specialist bakeries, kopitiam, and restaurants. One local speciality in particular, a bun with a buttery core and topped with a crispy and fragrant coffee pastry crust, has achieved iconic status in Malaysia, and franchises like Rotiboy and Pappa Roti which specialise in these coffee buns have successfully expanded abroad to multiple nations and spawned hundreds of outlets. However, the popular buns that remain a favourite among Malaysians are the buns that are filled with a sweet shredded coconut filling, kaya (coconut jam), pandan kaya (screwpine with coconut jam), sweet corn, chocolate, red bean paste and butter buns.\nRoti golok is a type of sweet and soft bread that  is commonly eaten in Kelantan. The bread consists of generous amounts of butter, sweetened condensed milk, and sometimes cheese, chocolate, or other toppings. The name \"golok\" originated from the Golok River, which is located between the Malaysia–Thailand border.\n\n### Other staples\nAs in Peninsular Malaysia, rice is the undisputed staple food for the majority of the people of Sabah and Sarawak. Rice is central to Kadazandusun culture, and its paramount importance is reflected in the annual Kaamatan festival, as well as traditional beliefs and customs since antiquity which revolve around the veneration of rice spirits. For other ethnic communities throughout Sabah and Sarawak, cassava or tapioca tubers as well as sago starch are also popular staples. The tapioca tuber is as important as rice to the Bajau people of Sabah, while the Dayak peoples of Sarawak make extensive use of both the tuber and leaves of the tapioca plant in their cooking. Sago starch is derived from the pith extracted from the sago palm, and is the staple food for the Melanau and the Penan peoples of Sarawak.\nSago starch is prepared as a gooey and sticky paste by the Bisaya and Kedayan communities called ambuyat, and is called linut by the Melanau. It is eaten by rolling the paste around the prongs of a bamboo fork, and dipping it into soup, sambal, or other varieties of gravies and dipping sauces. Aside from being the source for sago pith, the sago palm is a source of another delicacy for the indigenous peoples of Borneo: the sago grub. Called butod in Sabah and ulat mulong in Sarawak, sago grubs are typically eaten raw but also served deep-fried, roasted or sauteed.\n\n## Protein\n\n\n### Meat\nMalaysian poultry is handled according to halal standards to conform with the country's dominant and official religion, Islam. Imported poultry is available at major hypermarkets, supermarkets and speciality stores, especially in affluent areas where a significant expatriate community can be found.\nFish, both freshwater and saltwater, features prominently in the Malaysian diet. Most local fish is purchased soon after it is caught, while frozen fish is generally imported. Such fish, namely salmon and cod, are frequently eaten in Malaysia but are not found in Malaysian waters.\nMany types of seafood are consumed in Malaysia, including shrimp or prawn, crab, squid, cuttlefish, clams, cockles, snails, sea cucumber and octopus. In general, members of all ethnic communities enjoy seafood, which is considered halal by Malaysian Muslims (according to Shafi’i fiqh), though some species of crabs are not considered halal as they can live on both land and sea. Sea cucumbers are considered halal.\nBeef is common in the Malaysian diet, though the consumption of beef is proscribed by some followers of Hinduism and certain Chinese folk religious sects. Beef can be commonly found cooked in curries, stews, roasted, or eaten with noodles. Malays generally eat beef that is halal. Australian beef prepared under the Government Supervised Muslim Slaughter System (AGSMS) is imported into Malaysia and is halal.\nMalaysian Malays, who form about half of Malaysia's population, are Muslim and therefore do not consume pork since Islam forbids it. This does not prohibit others from producing and consuming pork products, and thus pork can be found in wet markets, supermarkets and hypermarkets, usually displayed with a non-halal disclaimer. Pork is consumed by the Chinese communities, Indians, the Iban, the Kadazan, Murut, Lun Bawang/Lundayeh, the Orang Asli, and non-Muslim expatriates.\nIn Malaysia, the term \"mutton\" refers to goat meat; lamb, or the meat of a young sheep, is always imported from countries like Australia and New Zealand. In the past mutton was primarily associated with Malaysian Indian cuisine, and was not as widely eaten due to health concerns as well as its perceived gamey flavour. Today, dishes like whole spit roast of mutton, mutton biryani and mutton soup are a common sight at banquets and events. Today, the demand for mutton during the fasting month and Hari Raya period exceeds that for Deepavali and Christmas combined.\n\n## Fruit and vegetables\n\n\n### Vegetables\nLocally-grown produce is available year-round as Malaysia is a tropical country and does not have four seasons. During rainy seasons, vegetable yields may decrease (which may result in an increase in market price), but rarely if ever stop altogether. Imported produce has made inroads into the market in recent years, either to supplement local demand for essential ingredients like garlic and potatoes, or to supply produce which does not grow well in Malaysia's climate and soil conditions. A few regions in Malaysia, like Cameron Highlands and the foothills adjacent to Mount Kinabalu, provide appropriate mean temperatures and soil conditions for the cultivation of temperate produce like tea.\nMalaysian-grown greens, tubers and vegetables commonly found nationwide include amaranth (bayam), bean sprouts (taugeh), brinjals (terung), bitter gourd (peria), bok choi (sawi), cabbage (kobis), choy sum, cucumber (timun), Chinese celery (daun sup), coriander (daun ketumbar), ginger (halia), green beans, water spinach (kangkung), ladies' fingers (bendi), leeks, lettuce, lotus root, maize (jagung), napa cabbage (kobis cina), sweet potatoes (ubi keledek), spring onions (daun bawang), katuk (cekur manis or sayur manis), pumpkin (labu), shiitake mushrooms (cendawan), stink beans (petai), tapioca (ubi kayu), taro or yam (ubi keladi), tomatoes, yambean or turnip, turmeric (kunyit), and yardlong beans (kacang panjang), carrot (lobak merah), and scallions (daun bawang).\nIn some areas in Malaysia local produce is grown on a small scale, and many rural communities like the Peninsular Orang Asli and certain tribal peoples of Sarawak forage wild edible ferns or vegetables to supplement their diet. Vegetable fern, better known as pucuk paku pakis, is perhaps the most widely available fern and is found in eateries and restaurants throughout the nation. Stenochlaena palustris is another type of wild fern popularly used for food. Endemic to East Malaysia, it is called midin in Sarawak and is prized for its fiddleheads by locals and visitors. It is known by the native peoples of Sabah as lemiding, lembiding or lombiding, where both the leaves and the fiddleheads of the plant are eaten. The young shoots of plants like bamboo and coconut are popularly harvested as food by communities outside urban areas.\nA popular way to cook leafy vegetables like kangkung and sweet potato leaves is stir-frying with a pungent sauce made from belacan (shrimp paste) and hot chilli peppers. Other vegetables popularly cooked this way include bean pods and fiddlehead ferns like paku pakis and midin. Vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, onions and yardlong beans are used to make a localised variety of pickle called acar. Vegetables and herbs are also popularly served undressed and often raw in some rural indigenous communities as ulam. An ulam spread may include items such as banana blossoms, cucumber, winged beans, pegaga leaves, petai, and yardlong beans, typically eaten with a pungent dipping sauce like sambal belacan.\n\n### Fruit\nMalaysia's tropical climate allows for fruit to be grown all year. A wide variety of common and obscure fruits, either locally grown or imported, are available throughout the country. While the vast majority of fruits grown in Malaysia naturally thrive in the tropics, a few areas in the country like Cameron Highlands or Kundasang in Sabah have different climate zones which enable the cultivation of temperate fruits like strawberries. Fruit is commonly served after a meal as dessert, and fruit juices are sought after as drinks of choice in a climate that is hot and humid all year. Pickled fruits or jeruk are widely available, whether sold from street stalls or specialist shops. Many localities are named after native fruits, most notably Alor Setar (buah setar) and Malacca (buah melaka).\n\nFruits are used to make rojak (Chinese: 水果囉喏), a widely served salad. It consists of pieces of fruits and vegetables bound with a viscous dark sauce made from shrimp paste, sugar, chilli, and lime juice. The Penang version is particularly well regarded. The dish is usually topped with a generous sprinkling of toasted ground peanuts.\nNotable fruits which are cultivated in Malaysia include:\n\nThe banana, or pisang in Malay. Many different cultivars are available on the market, and plantain is used for pisang goreng. Other parts of the banana plant may be used for culinary purposes.\nThe calamansi lime, or limau kasturi in Malay, is used as a souring agent in Malaysian cooking; the juice of the calamansi lime is also savoured on its own with ice and secondary flavourings like green apple juice, pandan leaves and dried preserved plums.\nThe cempedak, a fruit with a large and rough pod-like body. The edible flesh coating each pod is sweet, and has a soft custard-like texture.\nThe durian, a local tropical fruit with a spiky outer shell and a characteristic odour, is notable because it provokes strong emotions either of loving it or hating it. It is also known as the \"king of the fruits\". Several species of durian exist throughout Malaysia; common cultivars come with pale cream or yellow arils, whereas some varieties found in Borneo are naturally bright red, orange or purple in colour.\nThe guava, called jambu or jambu batu in Malay, is a crunchy fruit often eaten plain or garnished with a tart seasoning mix.\nThe honeydew, or tembikai susu in Malay, is an  aromatic green melon that is often cut up and served with cooked sago pearls in chilled coconut milk as a dessert.\nThe jackfruit, or nangka in Malay, is an enormous fruit similar in appearance to cempedak, but quite different in taste and texture. The fleshy covering of each pod is firm and sweet. Unripe jackfruit is occasionally used for cooking savoury meals.\nThe kedondong, a small green fruit with an extremely sour taste, usually pickled.\nThe langsat, fruits that resemble tiny potatoes and are borne in clusters similar to grapes, with a taste likened to a sweet and tart combination of grape and grapefruit. A second, larger variety known as duku generally bears large, generally round fruit with somewhat thick skin that does not release sap when cooked. The seeds are small with thick flesh, a sweet scent, and a sweet or sour alin.\nThe longan, which means \"dragon eye\" in Chinese. A related species called mata kucing (literally \"cat's eye\" in Malay) has a virtually identical taste to commercially cultivated longan. However, the mata kucing fruit (Euphoria malaiense) is smaller, the fleshy aril is thinner, and the yellow rind is bumpy and leathery like a lychee fruit.\nThe mango, or mangga in Malay. The state of Perlis is famous for its Harumanis variety (from the Mangifera indica cultivar), which is registered as a product of geographical indication (GI) with the Malaysian Intellectual Property Organisation (MyIPO). Another notable species of mango found only in Borneo and used extensively in local cookery is Mangifera pajang, known in Sabah as bambangan and Sarawak as buah mawang.\nThe mangosteen, or manggis in Malay. In contrast to the durian, mangosteen is often called the \"queen of the fruits\".\nThe papaya, or betik in Malay, is a common fruit available all year in Malaysia,  widely eaten to conclude a meal.\nThe pineapple, or nanas in Malay, is widely eaten as a fruit and used extensively in local cooking, such as a curried pineapple dish called pajeri nanas.\nThe pitaya, better known locally as dragon fruit, is available in red-fleshed and white-fleshed varieties.\nThe pomelo, or limau bali in Malay, grows in the Sungai Gedung area in the state of Perak and has been granted GI status. It is also called limau tambun, after the town of Tambun which is also famed for its pomelo produce. As pomelos are associated with traditional Chinese festivities, most farms harvest twice a year in conjunction with Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival.\nThe rambutan, as the name suggests, has fleshy pliable spines or 'hairs' on its outer shell, which is usually red or yellow in colour. Once the hairy exterior is peeled away, the tender, fleshy, sweet-and-sour-tasting fruit is revealed.\nThe rose apple, called jambu air or jambu merah in Malay, not to be confused with jambu batu or guava. The term refers to various Syzygium species which are grown for their fruit. The fruit may be eaten on its own, or added to a rojak salad.\nThe sapodilla, better known locally as buah ciku, has a sweet malty flavour and grainy-textured flesh like a ripened pear.\nThe soursop, known as durian belanda in Malay and lampun to the Dusun people of Borneo, is commonly made into juice and smoothies; the leaves of the soursop plant are boiled and drunk as a herbal infusion.\nThe starfruit, or belimbing in Malay. Malaysia is a global leader in starfruit production by volume and ships the fruit widely to Asia and Europe.\nThe sugar apple, or epal kustard in Malay, comes in red-skinned and green-skinned varieties.\nThe tarap, also called marang, is native to Borneo and related to cempedak and jackfruit. While the fruits are about the same size and shape as a durian and also emit a noxious odour, the spines of the tarap are soft and rubbery compared to the durian's hard, thorny spines. The fruit itself is smooth, soft and creamy, and the flavour is reminiscent of sweet custard apple with a hint of tartness.\nThe watermelon, or tembikai in Malay, comes in red-fleshed and yellow-fleshed varieties.\n\n## Ingredients\nChilli peppers are indispensable in Malaysian kitchens, and both fresh and dried forms are used. Chillies come in several sizes, shapes and colours. As a general rule, two type of chilli cultivars are the most commonly available: the bird's eye chilli (cili padi), which although small in size are extremely pungent and very hot; and longer varieties, which tend to be much milder. Green chillies are more peppery in taste, while red chillies, green chillies which have been left to ripen, have a slightly sweeter heat. If a milder flavour is preferred, the seeds and membranes are removed from the chilli pods before they are cut, or the chillies are left whole and removed prior to serving. Some common uses include grinding the chillies into a paste or sambal; chopping fresh chillies as a condiment or garnish; and pickling whole or cut chillies.\nBelacan is essential to Malaysian cooking. It is a type of shrimp paste which is pressed into a block and sun-dried. In its raw form it has a pungent smell. Once cooked, the aroma and flavour mellow and contribute a depth of flavour to the dish. To prepare belacan for use, one typically wraps a small amount in foil, which is then roasted over a flame or placed into a preheated oven. Belacan is most commonly pounded or blended with local chilli peppers, shallots and lime juice to make the most popular and ubiquitous relish in Malaysia, sambal belacan. Belacan is also crumbled into a ground spice paste called rempah, which usually includes garlic, ginger, onions or shallots, and fresh or dried chilli peppers. A rempah paste is similar in form and function to an Indian wet masala paste or Thai curry paste, and is often browned and caramelised (Malay: tumis) to mellow the raw flavours of its component ingredients and produce a harmonised finish.\nThe coconut (Malay: kelapa) is another quintessential feature of Malaysian cuisine, and virtually all parts of the plant are used for culinary purposes. The white fleshy part of the coconut endosperm may be grated, shredded and used as is; dried to make desiccated coconut; or toasted until dark brown and ground to make kerisik. Grated coconut flesh is also squeezed to make coconut milk, which is used extensively in savoury dishes and desserts throughout the country. Coconut oil is used for cooking and cosmetic purposes, and may be either obtained by processing copra (dried coconut flesh) or extracted from fresh coconuts as virgin coconut oil. Coconut water, the clear liquid found inside the cavity of each coconut, is a popular cooler in Malaysia's hot and humid climate. Gula melaka is unrefined palm sugar produced from the sap of the coconut flower. It is the most traditional sweetener in Malaysian cooking and imbues a rich caramel-like flavour with a hint of coconut. Coconut fronds are traditionally used to wrap food, hollowed out coconut husks and shells may be used as a source of charcoal fuel for barbecued meats and traditional pastry making, and even the apical bud or growing tip of the coconut palm is a popular delicacy served in rural communities and specialty restaurants.\nSoy sauce of different varieties is another important ingredient. Light soy sauce contributes its pleasantly salty flavour to a variety of stir-fries, marinades and steamed dishes. In some hawker establishments, freshly sliced or pickled chillies arrive immersed in light soy sauce to be used for dipping. Dark soy sauce is thicker, more intense in flavour and less salty. It is often used when a heartier flavour is desired, particularly with masak kicap (a style of braising with a blend of soy sauce varieties) dishes, and also to darken the color of a dish. Kicap manis, sweetened soy sauce sometimes flavoured with star anise or garlic, is also a popular seasoning for cooking. The sweet and savoury taste of kicap manis also functions as a substitute to approximate the combination of dark soy sauce and thick caramel sauce, which is primarily used to colour and season stewed dishes.\nCommon herbs include lemongrass (Malay: serai), a type of grass with a lemony aroma and flavour. Young, fresh stems are more desirable as older stems tend to acquire a woody texture. The tender white part closest to the base of the stem is thinly sliced and eaten raw in salads, or pounded with other aromatics to make a rempah. It is also used whole in boiled and simmered dishes. The pandan (screwpine) leaf is the Asian equivalent of vanilla in Western cuisine. Its subtle aroma is released when the leaves are bruised by tying one or two long leaves into a knot, and used for cooking curries, rice and desserts. The leaves can also be used to wrap items like rice, chicken or fish for cooking. Pandan leaf is also available in liquid essence or powdered form to flavour and colour cakes. Turmeric (Malay: kunyit) is a rhizome popular for its flavour as well as colouring properties. The leaves and flowers of the turmeric plant are also used in cooking or eaten raw.\nTofu products, specifically fried tofu, are widely used as cooking ingredients and as side accompaniments. While fried tofu can be bland in flavour on its own, its main contribution is texture and especially with tofu puffs, the ability to soak up the flavour of whatever they are cooked in. Fried tofu products are found as a versatile component ingredient for dishes like stir fried noodles, rojak (fruit and vegetable salad), noodle soups, and stews. A popular way of serving fried tofu on its own is a salad with bean sprouts, shredded cucumber and spring onions, covered in a thick sweet and spicy dressing and dusted with roasted ground peanuts. Fried tofu may also be stuffed with a mixture of ground meat or shredded vegetables.\nDried seafood products contribute a savoury depth of flavour to some Malaysian dishes. Small dried anchovies, known as ikan bilis, are very popular. It acquires a crispy texture when deep-fried, and is served as an accompaniment or prepared as a sambal relish in this capacity. Ikan bilis is also boiled to make fish stock; in fact, instant ikan bilis stock granules are a popular seasoning in modern kitchens. Dried shrimp and salted dried fish are also used in various ways.\nOther essential seasoning and garnishes include tamarind (Malay: asam jawa), specifically the paste-like pulp extracted from the fruit pod which contributes a tart flavour to many dishes. Candlenuts (Malay: buah keras) are similar in appearance to macadamia nuts, being round, cream-coloured and having a high oil content. Candlenuts are normally ground to thicken sauces. Lup cheong is a type of dried Chinese sausage made from pork and spices. Mainly used by the Malaysian Chinese community, these sweet sausages are usually sliced very thinly and added for additional flavour and texture. Recent studies have shown that there are 62 commonly consumed Malaysian foods that include biogenic amines.\n\n## Structure of meals\nThere is no standard breakfast (Malay: sarapan) menu due to Malaysia's multi-ethnic social fabric as well as the advent of modern influences. Western-style breakfast like breakfast cereal, cooked eggs and toast have become commonplace in homes and when dining out, but heartier traditional fare based predominantly on noodles and rice dishes are still very popular. One may choose to start the day with the ubiquitous nasi lemak or kuih; venture for Chinese-style congee, dim sum and noodle soups; or settle for Indian-influenced fare such as roti canai, idli (Tamil: இட்லி iṭli /ɪɖlɪ/), thosai (Tamil: தோசை tōcai /t̪oːsaj/), and upma. In the state of Kelantan, the term nasi berlauk refers to a breakfast meal which consists of a small serve of rice and complementary dishes or lauk.\nFor lunch and dinner, food is not customarily served in courses but rather concurrently. A meal may consist of a single dish for solitary diners, or rice with many complementary dishes shared by all. At restaurants where food is cooked to order, there is often no distinction between appetizers/starters and main courses, and food will arrive at the table whenever it is ready. At some traditionally-run eateries where pre-cooked food is served, diners are meant to help themselves by starting with a plate of plain rice and choose from a buffet spread of assorted dishes. Like the Indonesian Nasi Padang, this is not an all-you-can-eat for a fixed price dining experience. The cost of the meal would depend on what the diner selects and how many different items were placed on the plate for consumption. In Malay-run warung (a small family-owned casual eatery or café) or restaurants (kedai makan), this style of dining is known as nasi campur which means \"mixed rice\". A similar concept exist at some eateries serving home-style Malaysian Chinese food, where it may be known as economy rice (Chinese: 杂饭).\nA practice known as \"open house\" (Malay: rumah terbuka) is popular during festive seasons, and even as an elaborate occasion to celebrate birthdays and weddings. Open house events are traditionally held at the home of the host: well-wishers are received and that everyone, regardless of background, is invited to attend. Home-cooked or catered food is provided by the host(s) at their own expense, and while it is acceptable for guests to bring along gifts for the host, they are expected to help themselves to the food as much as they like. Open house events may also be held at restaurants and larger public venues, especially when hosted by government agencies or corporations.\n\n## Food establishments\nA kopitiam or kopi tiam is a traditional coffee shop patronised for meals and beverages, predominantly operated by Chinese proprietors and especially members of the Hainanese community. The word kopi is a Malay/Hokkien term for coffee and tiam is the Hokkien and Hakka term for shop (Chinese : 店). A common sight in Malaysia and neighbouring Singapore, menus often feature offerings like nasi lemak, boiled eggs, roti bakar, noodle dishes, bread and kuih. The owners of some kopitiam establishments may lease premise space to independent stallholders, who sometimes offer more specialised dishes beyond standard Chinese kopitiam fare. Typical beverages include Milo, a malted chocolate drink considered iconic to Malaysians of all ages, as well as coffee (kopi) and tea (teh). Diners would use slang terms specific to kopitiam culture to order and customise drinks to their taste.\nThe omnipresent Mamak stall is a Malaysian institution. Available throughout the country and\nparticularly popular in urban areas, Mamak stalls and restaurants offer a wide range of food and some are open 24 hours a day. The proprietors of these establishments are members of Malaysia's Tamil Muslim community, who have developed a distinct culinary style and wield an enormous influence on Malaysian food culture disproportionate to their numbers. A type of meal served buffet-style at some Mamak eateries is called nasi kandar, which is analogous to the Malay nasi campur where you pay for what you have actually eaten. The diner is to choose from a variety of curried dishes made with chicken, beef, mutton, or seafood. A mixture of curry sauces is then poured on the provided rice: this is called banjir (literally means \"flooding\").\n\n## Cuisines of Malaysia\n\n\n### Malay cuisine\nFor a traditional Malay meal, rice is considered the centerpiece of a meal, with everything else considered as an accompaniment, relish or side dish for the rice. Malay cuisine bears many similarities to Indonesian cuisine, in particular some of the regional traditions from Sumatra. It has also been influenced by Chinese, Indian, Thai and many other cultures throughout history, producing a distinct cuisine of their own. Some regional Malay dishes, such as arisa and kacang pool, are examples of influence from Arab cuisine due to longstanding historical and religious ties. Many Malay dishes revolve around a rempah, which is usually sauteed in oil (tumis) to draw out flavours to form the base of a dish. A dipping relish called sambal is an essential accompaniment for most Malay dishes.\n\nAir asam cabai picit or air asam picit is a traditional Malaysian dish originated in the northern regions of Malaysia, particularly from states like Kedah and Perlis. This dish features a spicy, savoury yet tangy tamarind-based sauce, known locally as \"air asam\", which is typically served alongside boiled or grilled fish and ulam-ulaman. The term \"picit\", meaning \"to squeeze\" in Malay, refers to the method of preparing the sauce, in which ingredients like bird's eye chilies, belachan and tamarind paste are crushed or squeezed together using fingers to release their flavors.\nAir bandung, a cold milk drink flavoured with rose cordial syrup, giving it a pink colour. Despite the name, there is no connection to the city of Bandung in Indonesia. Bandung within this context refers to anything that comes in pairs or is mixed from many ingredients.\nAir janda pulang, a traditional drink from Negeri Sembilan. It is suitable to drink with lunch and on hot days.\n Akok, a traditional sweet dessert in Kelantan, Malaysia. Made mainly from eggs, coconut milk, flour and brown sugar, akok has a distinctive caramel taste. It is often served during afternoon snack together with coffee. Akok is prepared in a special cooking utensil called sarang/dapur tembaga – a mould made of solid brass, which is surrounded with charcoal.\nApam johol, a sweetened rice cake wrapped in rambai leaves to preserve the aroma and for presentation. A specialty of Negri cuisine, it is sometimes eaten with rendang, sambal tumis and bean porridge.\nAsam pedas, a sour and spicy stew of meat, with the core ingredients being tamarind and chilli. Depending on the region, tomatoes, lady's fingers, shredded torch ginger bud and Vietnamese coriander (Malay: daun kesum) may also be added. Usually cooked with fish like mackerel or stingray, although some recipes use chicken and even oxtail.\nAyam goreng, a generic term for deep-fried chicken, typically marinated in a base of turmeric and other seasonings.\nAyam masak merah, literally meaning 'red-cooked chicken' in English. Pieces of chicken are first fried to a golden brown then slowly braised in a spicy tomato sauce. Peas are sometimes added to the dish, and it is garnished with shredded kaffir lime leaves as well as coriander. It is often paired with nasi tomato–rice cooked with tomato sauce or paste, milk, dried spices, and a sauteed rempah base of garlic, onions, ginger.\n\nAyam percik, also known as ayam golek in some states, is grilled marinated chicken basted with a spiced coconut milk gravy.\nBubur lambuk, a savoury rice porridge consumed during the fasting month of Ramadhan, made with a mixture of lemongrass, spices, vegetables, and chicken or beef. It is usually cooked communally at a local mosque, which is then distributed to the congregation as a meal to break the fast every evening. In the state of Terengganu, bubur lambuk is prepared with wild herbs, budu, sweet potatoes, and seafood.\nGulai, the Malay term for a curried stew. The main ingredients for gulai may be poultry, beef, mutton, various kinds of offals, fish and seafood, and also vegetables such as cassava leaves and green/unripe jackfruit. The gravy is usually yellowish-brown in color due to the sauteed and browned rempah which forms its base, and the addition of ground turmeric. The gravy's consistency may vary in thickness depending on the cook.\n\nIkan bakar, barbecued or chargrilled fish, usually smeared with a sambal-based sauce. It may also be accompanied with air asam, a dip made from shrimp paste, onion, chillis and tamarind juice.\nIkan goreng, a generic term for shallow- or deep-fried fish, which is almost always marinated prior to cooking. There are countless recipes and variants for what is arguably the most typical method of cooking fish in Malaysia.\nKebebe, a specialty of Lenggong, Perak, is a fruit salad consisting of 13 ingredients that provide a balance of spicy, sweet and tangy flavours when mixed. It is allegedly able to cure nausea after eating too much.\nKerabu, a type of salad-like dish which can be made with any combination of cooked or uncooked fruits and vegetables, as well as the occasional meat or seafood ingredient. There are many kerabu recipes, which often have little in common in preparation: kerabu taugeh is made with blanched bean sprouts and quintessentially Malay ingredients like kerisik, while preparations like kerabu mangga (shredded green mango salad) resemble a Thai-style yam salad in taste profile, kerabu maggi using Maggi noodles, and kerabu sare is made with seaweed, stewed fish and coconut, sambal and lime juice.\nKeropok lekor, a speciality of the state of Terengganu and other states on the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia. Keropok lekor is a savoury fritter made from a combination of batter and shredded fish. Sliced and fried just before serving, it is eaten with hot sauce.\nKerutuk daging, a type of coconut milk-based curry. Traditionally it is best eaten with white rice, sambal belacan and ulam-ulaman or Malay salad.\n Ketupat, a variant of compressed rice, wrapped in a woven palm frond pouch. As the rice boils, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the ketupat its characteristic form and texture. Usually eaten with rendang (a type of dry beef curry) or served as an accompaniment to satay, ketupat is also traditionally served on festive occasions such as Eid (Hari Raya Aidilfitri) as part of an open house spread.\nKuzi ayam, a thick curry. Traditionally it is eaten with white rice, sambal belacan and ulam.\nLaksam or laksang, a different variant of laksa found in the northern and northeastern states of the Peninsular. Laksam consists of thick flat rice noodle rolls in a full-bodied, rich and slightly sweet white gravy of minced fish, coconut milk and shredded aromatic herbs.\nMasak lemak is a style of cooking which employs liberal amounts of turmeric-seasoned coconut milk. Sources of protein like chicken, seafood smoked meats and shelled molluscs, perhaps paired with fruits and vegetables such as bamboo shoots, pineapples and tapioca leaves are often cooked this way. Certain states are associated with a specific variant of this dish: for example, masak lemak cili api/padi is a speciality of Negeri Sembilan.\n\nMee bandung Muar, a traditional noodle dish from Muar that is cooked with yellow noodles coupled with egg in addition to a thick broth-gravy made of a combination of dried shrimps, onion, spices, shrimp paste and chillies. Prawn, meat, fish cakes and vegetables are also added.\n\nMee calong, a noodle dish eaten with fish soup, fish balls, and tofu puffs.

Because the vast majority of Chinese Malaysians are descendants of immigrants from southern China, Malaysian Chinese cuisine is predominantly based on an eclectic repertoire of dishes with roots from Cantonese cuisine, Hakka cuisine, Fujian cuisine and Teochew cuisine.\nAs these early immigrants settled in different regions throughout what was then British Malaya and Borneo, they carried with them traditions of foods and recipes that were particularly identified with their origins in China, which gradually became infused with the characteristics of their new home locale in Malaysia while remaining distinctively Chinese. For example, Hainanese chicken rice is usually flavoured with tropical pandan leaves and served with chilli sauce for dipping, and tastes unlike the typical chicken dishes found in Hainan Island itself. Some of these foods and recipes became closely associated with a specific city, town or village, eventually developing iconic status and culminating in a proliferation of nationwide popularity in the present day.\nChinese food is especially prominent in areas with concentrated Chinese communities, at roadside stalls, hawker centres and kopitiam, as well as smart cafes and upmarket restaurants throughout the nation. Many Chinese dishes have pork as a component ingredient, but chicken is available as a substitution for Muslim customers from the wider community, and some Chinese restaurants are even halal-certified.\nA sample of representative Malaysian Chinese dishes found nationwide include:\n\nBak Kut Teh (pork ribs soup). The root meaning for the dish, \"Bak Kut\" (Hokkien dialect) is the term for meaty ribs, at its simplest cooked with garlic, dark soy sauce and a specific combination of herbs and spices which have been boiled for many hours. Popularly regarded as a health tonic, this soup is historically eaten by hard working Chinese coolies working on the wharfs at Port Swettenham (now Port Klang) and clearing estates, accompaniment with strong tea (\"Teh\") on the side. There are some differences in seasoning amongst other Chinese communities; the Teochew prefer a clear broth which is heavier on garlic and pepper, while the Cantonese may include additional varieties of medicinal herbs and spices. Variations include the so-called chik kut teh (made with chicken and a version that is gaining popularity with Muslim diners), seafood bak kut teh, and a \"dry\" (reduced gravy) version which originated from the town of Klang.\nBakkwa, literally \"dried meat\", bakkwa is better understood as barbecued meat jerky.

The chicken is then chopped up, and served with a bowl or plate of rice cooked in chicken fat and chicken stock, along with another bowl of clear chicken broth and a set of dips and condiments.

While raw fish preparations are thought to have existed in China during antiquity and can be found in the Chaoshan region of Guangdong province in modern times, yusheng was developed by Loke Ching Fatt, who at the time owned Loke Ching Kee, a Chinese restaurant in the city of Seremban. It consists of strips of raw fish tossed at the dining table with shredded vegetables, crispy tidbits and a combination of sauces and condiments.

Combined with rice, salt and fresh meat or fish, the mixture is then placed into a sealed jar or container for fermentation. Contemporary variants for bosou add bananas and pineapples to the mixture.

Ingredients like poultry, fish, pork, vegetables or rice are mixed with fragrant herbs like lemongrass, tapioca leaves and bungkang leaves (a species of myrtle from the Eugenia genus), then sealed within the bamboo tubes and placed directly over an open fire.

Halal versions of kolo mee replace the pork components with beef (earning the moniker of mee sapi) or chicken, and lard with peanut or vegetable oil.

Traditionally homemade and eaten during Yuanxiao (Chinese : 元宵) as well as the Dongzhi Festival (Chinese : 冬至), tangyuan is now available year around sold as dessert. Tangyuan dumplings with filling are usually served in a lightly sweetened clear syrup, while unfilled ones are served as part of a sweet dessert soup.\nTapai, a popular dessert at Malay homes throughout Peninsular Malaysia during Hari Raya, made from fermented glutinous rice or tapioca. Tapai may be eaten on its own, or served with contemporary toppings like ice cream, chocolate and fruit. Not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage from Sabah, also known as tapai, which is made from the same ingredients and with similar methods but have undergone advanced stages of fermentation to produce alcoholic content.\nTau foo fah or Dau Huay (Chinese : 豆腐花 or 豆花), a velvety pudding of very soft silken tofu, traditionally flavoured with a brown sugar syrup.\nUFO tart (Chinese : 牛屎堆), this consists of a flat, thin base of baked mini butter sponge cake topped with a creamy egg custard, which is in turn crowned with a meringue slurry. Its name in Chinese literally means \"cow pile dung\", which alludes to the piped shape of the cake base's toppings and the meringue's darker shade as a result of caramelisation. Popularized by a Hainanese bakery in Sandakan in the 1950s, the popularity of these treats has spread to Kota Kinabalu and several other towns in Sabah.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nShahrim Abdul Karim, M; Abdul Halim, Nurhasmilaalisa (2014). \"The structure of Penang street food in Malaysia\".

The migrations continued during the Portuguese Inquisition, the Mahratta Invasion of Goa and Bombay etc. After their migrations, they adopted some aspects of local Mangalorean culture, but also retained some elements of their Konkani way of life.\n\n## Non-vegetarian cuisine\nTheir curry uses a lot of coconut and curry leaves while ginger, garlic and chilli are also used. Mangalorean Catholic cuisine has distinct Portuguese influence as can be seen in Laitao, the famous Pork Bafat served as the Pièce de résistance at wedding dinners, and Pork Sorpotel. Fabled cooks like Davidam or Alicebai were called in to help with the repast. Mangalorean Catholics mix pork blood and other parts in most of their pork delicacies as can be seen from Pork Bafat, Cabidela and Pork Kaliz Unkiti (heart and intestines). Sanna–Dukra Maas (Sanna – idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas – Pork) is an inventive made from the leavened bread called sanna. Chicken Indaz is also popular. The traditional Rosachi kadi (Ros Curry), a curry made with ros (coconut milk) with chicken, fish or mutton is quite popular and is served during the Ros (anointing) ceremony that is held 1 or 2 days before a Mangalorean Catholic wedding. Their fish curry especially their Fish Roe Curry, is known for its taste in the whole of coastal India while fried fish in their style is well known. The Sheveo and Pathal Bakri (a variant of Kori Rotti) are dry rice flakes dipped in chicken gravy dishes.\n\n## Vegetarian cuisine\nIt is customary for Catholic Christians to abstain from meat, during the season of Lent, as a part of the lenten sacrifice.  \nThe \"Balthazaar chutney\" is a popular condiment. The dish originated when Balthazaar, a Mangalorean Catholic nobleman, was taken prisoner by Tippu Sultan in 1784 during the Captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam. Unable to stomach the indifferent camp food, he offered to make a chutney for the captured Mangalorean Catholics.  \nThe pollu, a type of sambhar with galmbi (powdered dried fish) or kambulmas (dried tuna) is popular. The traditional fode is a popular pickle. Thail piao, which means literally vegetables dumped with oil and onions and left to boil on the fire wood is quite popular. Karamb (cucumber salad) and foka (lady’s finger combined with cashewnuts). The appa and panpole (a type of crepe) are popular delicacies made of soaked rice, water and salt. The thath bakri is a banana leaf rice dish made with ground red boiled rice mixed with raw scraped coconut and roasted on a tava on a banana leaf. The mitais, mandas, ushae, pitae and mani are well known sweet dishes.\n\nKuswar is a term often used to mention a set of unique Christmas goodies which are part of the cuisine of the Mangalorean Catholic community There are as many as 22 different traditional recipes that form this distinct flavour of Christmas celebration in Mangalore. Neuries are puffs stuffed with plums, nuts, and fried theel (sesame) and sugar. Kidyo or kulkuls are curly concoctions dipped in sugar treacle, pathekas are savoury of green nandarkai bananas, theel laddus and jaw snapping gulios. Macaroons is what Manglore is famous for and the subtle flavored rose cookies are a hot favorite. But it is the rich plum cake which takes the better part of a week to make. Candied fruit, plums, currents, raisins are dexterously cut and soaked in rum. Flour sieved and gently warmed in the sun.  Nuts shelled and chopped and the whole family comes together to make the cake.  Jobs are allotted, one to whip up the eggs, while another creams the butter and sugar, cake tins are lined, and a strong pair of arms requisitioned to do the final mixing and stirring.\nPatrode or pathrade, a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is also popular. The Mangalorean Catholic version of this steamed delicacy is a slight variation on the Tuluva recipe.  More spicy, it is fried in miit mirsang (salt and chilli), a popular condiment used to flavour Mangalorean Catholic dishes.\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## External links\nMangalorean Catholic Cuisine by RoseMary Albuquerque Pai from The Summer Sands Online newspaper\nMangalorean Cuisine by MyNation easy Recipes and Dishes\n[1] www.oneplateplease.com by Jason Castelino, a Mangalorean foodie on the quest of unearthing the history and hidden gems of Mangalorean Cuisine\n[2] by Rovena's Spices & Aromas, Mangalorean & Traditional food\n[3] by Hungry Mangy - A home recipe collection submitted by members of the Hungry mangy group.",

The Meiteis live in the valley of Manipur where freshwater fish from lakes and rivers and ponds had been plentiful until recent times. In Manipur, meals are known as chakluk.\nNon-Meitei cuisine can be found in the hills of the state.\n\n## Basic diet\nThe staple diet of Manipur consists of rice, fish, and large varieties of leafy vegetables (both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables in a kitchen garden and rear fishes in small ponds (pukhri) around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown at home or obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having its own special vegetables and preparations. The taste is very different from other Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic herbs and roots that are peculiar to the region.\n\n### Aromatic herbs and roots used by Meitei Manipuris and non-Meitei Manipuris\nNungshi hidak (Mint)\nMaroi napaakpi (Hooker chives)\nYenam (maroi nakuppi) (Chinese chives)\nAwaa phadigom (Mexican coriander)\nMayang-ton (Lemon basil)\nToning-khok (Chameleon plant)\nKhanghuman/Kanghu-maan (Salvia dianthera, formerly Meriandra dianthera and Meriandra bengalensis)\nMukthrubi (Zanthoxylum armatum (Sichuan peppercorn)\nPhakpai (Vietnamese coriander)\nChantruk (pepper cress)\nYaipan (Curcuma angustifolia)\nKang-hu mapaan (galangal)\nTakhel-manao\nLeibakmaroom (Calvatia gigantea)\nUyen (similar to shiitake mushroom)\nUchi-na (jelly ear)\nChengum (mushroom)\nCharu-yen  (Volvariella volvacea)\nKanglayen (split gill mushroom)\nUshoi (bamboo shoots)\nThere are also ingredients in the cuisine that require an acquired taste, such as hawaijaar (fermented soya bean, somewhat similar to the Japanese nattō), soibum (fermented bamboo shoot), ngaa-ri (fermented fish), and hentak (fermented fish powder and herbs).\n\n### Meats and seafood used by Meitei Manipuris and non-Meitei Manipuris\nHameng (mutton)\nKhajing (shrimp)\nNga (fish)\nNganu (duck)\nOak (pork)\nSan (beef or buffalo)\nTharoi (snail)\nYen (chicken)\n\n## Dishes\nEromba: a chutney of vegetables boiled or steamed with a lot of red chillies or umorok (king chilli) with ngari (fermented fish), smoked or roasted fish and mashed together. It is garnished with herbs like maroi (maroi nakuppi, phakpai, mayang-ton, toning-khok, kaanghumaan, lomba, tilhou, chaantruk, coriander leaves and many more).\nSingju: a piquant salad which is prepared with an assortment of raw vegetables, and can have varying combinations depending on preference or season. The vegetables are julienned, while the accompanying herbs and leaves are coarsely chopped or shredded. Some of the usual main ingredients are cabbage, lotus stem, laphu tharo (banana flower), komprek (a kind of scented herb), kollamni (another herb), yongchaak (tree beans/stink beans/Parkia speciosa). The accompanying herbs and leaves include sweet pea shoots, toningkhok (Houtuniya cordata) leaves and roots, heibi mana, coriander leaves etc. Most singju items are seasonal. Singju can be seasoned with a chili paste flavored with roasted ngari (fermented fish), or with roasted \"thoiding\" seeds (Perilla frutescens) powder and roasted chick pea powder/roasted besan, plus roasted red chili powder. Thoiding seeds are rich in healthy fats and vitamins, and when they are roasted they give a nutty flavor that is distinctive to a singju. Other additional ingredients include boiled beans and peas, and also savory crispies, though these are optional.\nChamthong or kangshoi: a stew of any seasonal vegetables with coarsely chopped onions or spring onion, maroi - both yennam nakuppi and napakpi, ginger, ngari and salt, topped with ngari, dried fish, or fried fish pieces and water. It is soupy in consistency and is eaten with rice.\nMorok metpa: a coarse paste prepared with green or dry red chilies mixed with chopped onions, coriander leaves and other local herbs for garnishing. The chilies are steamed or roasted with ngari or simply crushed and then mashed with salt and this fish condiment; fried fish pieces can also be added to it. This is something which accompanies both the meals as a routine side dish.\nKang-ngou or kaang-hou: various vegetables stir-fried with traditional spices\nNganam: fish and maroi baked on a pan\nPaaknam: a pancake prepared with a mixture of pea flour, maroi napaakpi, laphu tharo, awa phadigom, and ngari wrapped in turmeric and banana leaves and either baked in a pan or steamed first and then roasted\nNga thongba: a fish curry\nNga ataoba thongba: a fried fish curry\nNga atoiba: mashed fish\nOoti: a typical vegetarian dish generally characterised by its slightly overcooked texture of having the ingredients slightly mashed. Baking soda is also frequently used for this dish.\nPakoura thongba or bora thongba: a fritter curry\nChagem pomba: a curry made with fermented soya, mustard leaves, roasted or smoked fish and other herbs; broken rice is also a main ingredient and so the name \"chagem\" in this dish\nKeli chana: a spicy chickpea snack\nAlu kangmet: boiled potatoes mashed with fried red chili and nakuppi with salt and/or dressed with mustard oil\nSana thongba: a curry prepared with paneer\nYen thongba: a chicken curry\nNganu thongba: a duck curry\nOak thongba: a pork curry\nSan thongba: a beef curry\nHameng thongba: a mutton curry\nTharoi thongba: a snail curry\nPan hawaijar thongba: a taro and fermented soybean curry\nSoibum thongba: a bamboo shoot curry\nSagol hawai thongba: a black lentil curry\nA-nganba or champhut: steamed vegetables, such as pumpkin, peas, carrots, French beans, etc\nChak-hao kheer: a black rice pudding\nTilhou kheer: a onion pudding\nChemmeen kheer: a prawn pudding\nSangom kheer: a white rice pudding\nKabok: A puffed rice snack\nHei thongba: a fruit curry\nKangshubi: a ground seed snack\nYerum tal: an omelette\n\n## See also\nBurmese cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

Masalas are used extensively in Indian cuisine to add spice and flavour, most familiarly to Western cuisine in chicken tikka masala and chicken curry, or in masala chai.

    "text": "# Masala chai\n\nMasala chai (; lit. 'mixed-spice tea') is a popular beverage originating in the Indian subcontinent. It is made by adding aromatic herbs and spices to chai, which is made from brewing black tea (usually crush, tear, curl) in milk and water, and sweetening with sugar.\n\n## Etymology\nThe term chai originated from the Chinese word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea) via the Hindi chai (चाय). In English, this spiced tea is commonly referred to as chai tea, or simply chai. Originating in India, the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many coffee and teahouses, with many using the term chai latte or chai tea latte for their version to indicate that it is made with steamed milk, much like that used to make a latte but mixed with a spiced tea concentrate instead of espresso.\n\n## History\nThe word for tea in most Indian languages is \"chai\" derived from the Chinese word cha. Tea however became a popular beverage introduced to India by the British. Tea plants have grown wild in the Assam region since antiquity, but historically, Indians viewed tea as an herbal medicine rather than as a recreational beverage.\nIn the 1830s, the British East India Company became concerned about the Chinese monopoly on tea, which constituted most of its trade and supported the enormous consumption of tea in Great Britain of around 1 pound (0.45 kg) per person per year. British colonists had recently noticed the existence of the Assamese tea plants and began to cultivate tea plantations locally. In 1870, over 90% of the tea consumed in Great Britain was still of Chinese origin, but by 1900, this had dropped to 10%, largely replaced by tea grown in India (50%) and Ceylon (33%).\nHowever, consumption of black tea within India remained low until the promotional campaign by the Indian Tea Association in the early 20th century, which encouraged factories, mines and textile mills to provide tea breaks for their workers. It also supported many independent chaiwalas throughout the growing railway system.\nTea was promoted as served Indian style, with small added amounts of milk and sugar. The Indian Tea Association initially disapproved of independent vendors' tendency to add spices and greatly increase the proportions of milk and sugar, thus reducing their usage (and thus purchase) of tea leaves per liquid volume. However, chai later firmly established itself as a popular beverage.\n\n## Preparation and ingredients\n\n\n### Preparation\nMasala chai is composed of three major components: masala, chai (or tea), and milk. Recipes and methods of preparation for chai can vary by geography and family.\nOne way to prepare masala chai is to simmer spices in a pot of water. Tea is then added to the pot and brewed to preference. After brewing, the tea and spice mixture is strained, and milk or cream is added.\nA common Maharashtrian method for preparing  one cup of chai is to first combine one-half cup of water with one-half cup of milk in a pot over heat. Sugar may be added at this point or after. Ginger is then grated into the mixture, followed by the addition of tea masala, typically consisting of crushed ginger, crushed cardamom, lemongrass, cloves, and cinnamon. The mixture is brought to a boil, and one teaspoon of loose black tea is added.\n\n### Tea\nBlack tea is typically used as a base in most chai recipes. The most common type of black tea is from Assam; however, a blend of different tea variations may be used. Assam, Darjeeling, and Nilgiri are the three most common types of tea used in chai in India.\n\n### Spices\nThe spices used in masala chai most often include cardamom, grated ginger, and cinnamon. Also used are cloves, star anise, black peppercorns, mint, lemongrass, and more.\nMasala chai in western India often excludes cloves and black peppercorns. A small amount of salt is often added to chai in the region of Bhopal. The Kashmiri version of chai is brewed with green tea instead of black tea and has a more subtle blend of spices with a pinch of salt. This version is a bit savoury and is pink in colour, due to the addition of baking soda.\n\n### Milk\nTraditionally in India, milk from water buffaloes is used to make chai. Although whole milk is usually used in masala chai, some people prefer alternatives such as soy milk or skimmed milk.\n\n### Sweetener\nWhite sugar, brown sugar, demerara sugar, honey, and jaggery are all used as sweeteners in chai.\n\n## Consumption\n\n\n### Consumption in the Indian subcontinent\nSmall vendors (called chaiwalla in Hindi/cha-ola in Bengali) are found by the side of every highway, road and alley – often the only establishments that will be open through the night. They generally also sell tobacco and snacks. Many will deliver tea to people's places of business in a chaidaan, a wooden or metal frame carrier for cups. Chai is sometimes served in a kulhar.\nIn Mumbai, roadside tea stalls serve small, inexpensive cups of tea called 'cutting chai'. They're so called for being a full-size, full-price cup of tea \"cut\" in half.\nIn Pakistan, masala chai is usually brewed with milk and sweetened with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon and/or cloves.\n\n### Consumption beyond the Indian subcontinent\nMasala chai is popular in East Africa and the Caribbean. It is also popular in the Gulf Arab region, where it is known as Chai Karak (Arabic: شاي كرك, Urdu: کڑک چائے). The drink was popularized by South Asian expatriate communities in the region.\n\n## See also\nIndian cuisine\nHistory of tea in India\nIndian tea culture\nPakistani tea culture\nChaiwala\nKulhar\nDarjeeling tea\nGinger tea\nNoon chai\nBandrek\nList of Indian drinks\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nThe Global Evolution of Chai Archived 4 June 2018 at the Wayback Machine",

    "text": "# Masala dosa\n\nMasala dosa (Tamil: மசாலா தோசை, Kannada: ಮಸಾಲೆ ದೋಸೆ, masāle dōsey/dōsai) is a dish of South India, consisting of a savoury dosa crepe stuffed with a spiced (masala) potato curry. It is a popular breakfast item in South India, though it can be served at all times of the day and found in many other parts of the country and overseas.\n\n## History\nIt is generally agreed that the dish was popularized in Madras (now Chennai) during the 1930s by K. Krishna Rao, a restaurateur who operated the popular Udupi style hotel called Sri Krishna Vilas Hotel on Mount Road and later the New Woodlands Hotel, both pioneers of Udupi cuisine. Rao is also regarded as the dish's creator.\nOne tale attributes it to the cooks of Someshvara III, King of Mysore (1126–1138), who combined leftover curry with dosas. However, while the Manasollasa compiled during his reign does mention a dosa-like dish called dosaka, potatoes are a New World plant not introduced to India under the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century.\n\n## Preparation\nWhile there is variation in the recipe from town to town, the basic recipe typically starts with a batter of parboiled rice, poha, and various legumes (black gram, pigeon peas, chickpeas), and incorporates various spices for flavour, such as fenugreek and dry red chilli. The rice and legumes are fermented by soaking them overnight in water, then ground into a batter. To make the dosa the batter is spread on a hot tava griddle using a ladle or a bowl.  It is pan-roasted until crispy, filled with potato curry, and served with chutneys, and sambar. One common variant is the paper masala dosa, which is made with a thinner batter, resulting in a crisper, almost paper-thin final product.\n\n## Variations\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Mauritian cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Mauritius reflects the island’s tropical environment and its long history of cultural diversity. Mauritian food traditions incorporate elements of African cuisine, Chinese cuisine, European cuisine—particularly French cuisine—and Indian cuisine, especially Bhojpuri cuisine, reflecting the various groups that settled on the island.\nDishes and culinary customs developed through the interactions of different groups on the island, including those of French settlers, African slaves, Indian indentured labourers, and Chinese migrants in the 19th century. Over time, these communities incorporated and adapted each other's food practices, contributing to the formation of Mauritian cuisine.\nSome dishes are widely consumed across ethnic groups, while others remain associated with particular communities for cultural or historical reasons. Regional and community-based culinary traditions include Indo-Mauritian cuisine, Creole cuisine, Sino-Mauritian cuisine, and Franco-Mauritian cuisine.\n\n## Common ingredients\nThe most common vegetables used in Mauritian cuisine are tomatoes, onions, lalo (okra), brinjal (eggplant), chou chou (chayote), lay (garlic), and pima (chillies). Rice and seafood, including salted fish, smoked blue marlin, shrimp, octopus, prawns, and crayfish (called camaron) are also staple ingredients used in Mauritian cuisine. \nSpices such as chili peppers, cardamom, and cloves are widespread in Mauritian cuisine.\n\n## Common foods\n\n\n### Staple food\nRice is a staple food in Mauritius. It is eaten fried, boiled, or cooked as part of dishes made of vegetables, meat, and seafood.\n\n### Main and side dishes\nChinese noodles (fried or boiled),  diri frir (fried rice), bol renversé, boulettes (fish balls, chayote and other vegetables, and meatballs in broth), Sino-Mauritian spring rolls, chop suey, halim, briani or briye (biryani), dalpuri served with big pea curry and tomato sauce, roti served with tomato sauce and pickles, curry, and 7-cari (thali) are common Mauritian dishes. Another well-known dish is vinnday or vindaye, a variant of vindaloo made with a mixture of vinegar, mustard seeds, and turmeric.\nMauritius is known for its sauces and curries, which are typically served with meat, seafood, and vegetable dishes. Other common preparations are chutney, achaar, and pickles. Mauritian curries typically do not contain coconut milk, commonly use European herbs (such as thyme), and use a wide variety of meat (such as duck) and seafood (such as octopus). Rougay or rougail is a tomato sauce cooked with onions, garlic, chillies, ginger, and a variety of spices, typically eaten with fish, meat, and vegetables. Mauritian versions of curry, chutney, rougail, and pickles differ considerably from the original Indian recipes.\n\n### Snacks\n\n\n### Desserts and pastries\n\n\n## Common drinks\n\n\n### Alcoholic drinks\n\n\n### Non-alcoholic drinks\n\n\n## History\n\n\n### Dutch influences\nDuring the Dutch period (1598-1710 AD), sugarcane from Java was first introduced to the island. At the time, sugarcane was mainly cultivated for the production of arrack, a precursor to rum. Cane sugar was not produced until 60 years later.\nIn 1639, deer from Java were brought to Mauritius by the Dutch governor, Adrian Van Der Stel, as livestock. Following a cyclone, the deer broke free and returned to the wild.\n\n### French and British influences\n\n\n### Sino-Mauritian cuisine\nSino-Mauritian cuisine includes both Chinese cuisine (transmitted from their ancestors and recently learnt through journeys to China) and localization of Chinese cuisine. Sino-Mauritian cuisine typically consist of fried vegetables, oyster sauce, fried rice, meat, and fish.\nThe 19th century saw the arrival of Chinese migrants, who came mostly from the southeastern part of China; these Chinese migrants were mainly Cantonese from Guandong, Hakka from Meixian, and Chinese people from Fujian. Chinese migrants mainly lived in harmony in the Chinatown in the capital of Port Louis and shared their culture with other communities. They are largely credited for making noodles, both steamed and fried, and fried rice popular. Sino-Mauritians also follow or have maintained some Chinese food traditions and customs, such as the tradition of Chinese red eggs, which are shared with family members. It is customary for them to eat fried noodles during birthday celebrations.\nBetween the 20th and 21st centuries, some Sino-Mauritians returned to China to learn new culinary dishes and returned to Mauritius, introducing new dishes in their restaurants in Mauritius. In the 21st century, Sino-Mauritians, who resided overseas (e.g., in China, Taiwan) for a few years before returning to Mauritius, also introduced new Chinese food and drink culture in Mauritius. For example, bubble tea drinking culture was introduced by Fabrice Lee, a Sino-Mauritian, who lived in Taiwan for 8 years before returning to Mauritius. The first bubble tea shop in Mauritius opened in late 2012; since then, there have been bubble tea shops in most shopping malls on the island.\n\nSino-Mauritian festival foods\n\nChinese and other Asian restaurants are present all around the island and offer a variety of chicken, squid, beef and fish dishes, most typically prepared in black bean sauce or oyster sauce. Mauritian families often consider a dinner at an Asian restaurant to be a treat.\n\n### Indo-Mauritian cuisine\nFollowing the abolition of slavery, Indian workers who migrated to Mauritius during the 19th century brought their cuisine with them. These indentured labourers came from different parts of India with varying culinary traditions. Traces of both northern and southern Indian cuisine can be found in Mauritius. As they are the largest ethnic group in Mauritius, they are largely credited for making flour and rice the staple dish of the island.\nIndo-Mauritian cuisine uses common ingredients, such as dals, to accompany the dishes, and an extensive array of spices such as saffron, cinnamon, cardamon, and cloves.\n\n### Mauritian Creole cuisine\nMauritian Creole dishes typically contain seafood, pulses, beans, corn and tapioca.\n\n## Beverage industry in Mauritius\n\n\n### Rum industry\nFrançois Mahé de Labourdonnais was the first person to support the development of rum industry in Mauritius. When Mauritius became a British colony, the plantation economy was mainly sugar cane. It was Dr. Pierre Charles François Harel who, in the 1850s, initially proposed the concept of local distillation of rum in Mauritius. Mauritius today houses four distilleries (Grays, Medine, Chamarel and St Aubin) and is in the process of opening an additional three.\n\n### Tea industry\nThe tea plant was introduced in Mauritius in 1760 by a French priest, Father Galloys. In 1770, Pierre Poivre planted tea plants on a large scale. However, it was only in the 19th century under British rule that commercial tea cultivation was encouraged by Robert Farquhar, the Governor of Mauritius, but this only lasted during his governance. Sir John Pope Hennessy, the 15th Governor of Mauritius, later revived local interest in tea cultivation and created tea plantations at Nouvelle France and at Chamarel.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nCulture of Mauritius\n\n\n== References ==",

There is also a notable presence of Meiteis in the neighbouring countries of Myanmar and Bangladesh. The Meiteis represent about 53% of Manipur's population.\n\n## Endonyms and exonyms\nThe Meitei are known by a number of endonyms, Meitei, Meetei, Meithei (Meitei), and as well as by numerous exonyms, such as Meckley, Manipuri, and Kathaeh or Kathay (Burmese: ကသည်း). The term Manipuri is widely used, but problematic because of its ambiguous scope: next to being a synonym for Meitei/Meetei, it can also refer in a wider sense to the native ethnic groups in the hills of Manipur.\n\n## Geographical distribution\n\n\n### India\nAs per the 2011 census, there 1,761,079 Meitei language-speakers in India.\nThe vast majority of them (1,522,132 people, 86 percent of the total) are in the state of Manipur, which is also their place of origin.\nEstimated 239,836 people of this population are Meitei Pangals. The remainder, 1,353,999 people, are ethnic Meiteis.\nA significant number (168,133 people, 9.5 percent) of Meitei language speakers are in the state of Assam.\nIn the Barak Valley region of Assam, Meitei people are the third largest ethnic group, after Bengalis and Hindi speakers.\n\n### Myanmar\nMyanmar has a significant population of Meitei people in Kachin state, Yangon Region, Sagaing Region, Shan state, Ayeyarwady Region, among others.\n\n### Bangladesh\nThe population of Meiteis are found in four districts of Sylhet Division in Bangladesh, namely Sylhet District (thirteen villages), Moulvibazar District (twenty-eight villages), Sunamganj District (three villages) and Habiganj District (four villages). In early times, there were Meitei population in Dhaka, Mymensingh and Comilla too.\n\n## Origins and history\nThe earliest sections of the Cheitharol Kumbaba, a Meitei chronicle, record the gradual spread of Meiteis across Kangleipak (Meitei for 'Manipur') and their assimilation of other clans into a confederacy.\n\n### In Kangleipak (Manipur)\nIn 1100 CE, Loyumba Shinyen (Old Manipuri: ꯂꯣꯌꯨꯝꯄ ꯁꯤꯟꯌꯦꯟ, romanized: Loyumpa Shinyen), an ancient Meitei language constitution was written and regulated under the supervision of Meitei King Loiyumba (Loyumba) (1074 CE-1112 CE) in the Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur). It is a formal proclamation of the proto-constitution which was drafted in 429 CE by Meitei King Naophangba. The idea of its constitutionalism was functional until it was substituted by the Manipur State Constitution Act 1947.\n\n### In Myanmar (Burma)\nMyanmar is home to a sizeable community of Meiteis, who are called Kathe in Burmese. Unlike other Hindu communities in Myanmar, the Meitei resemble other Burmese ethnic groups in terms of physical appearance, which has accelerated their assimilation and integration into Burmese society. In the early 1950s, Burmese Meiteis numbered approximately 40,000, with a third of them residing in Mandalay. Current estimates are approximately 25,000. Meiteis have resettled throughout the country, including in villages near Myitkyina to the north, Homalin, Kalewa, Pyay, in the center of the country, and Yangon to the south. They continue to practice Hinduism in Myanmar.\nAs a result of wars between the Meitei kingdom and the Konbaung dynasty between the 17th and 18th centuries, many Meiteis were resettled in the Burmese kingdom. Some Meitei settlements in modern-day Myanmar originate from the 1758–1759 war, and from the Burmese occupation of Manipur from 1819 to 1826. Alaungpaya, during the former campaign, resettled Meiteis in Sagaing and Amarapura. The Meitei people's horsemanship skills were employed in the Burmese royal army, where they formed the elite Cassay cavalry (ကသည်းမြင်းတပ်) and artillery regiments (ကသည်းအမြောက်တပ်) which were employed during the Burmese–Siamese wars. The Burmese court also retained a retinue of Manipuri Brahmins called Bamons, also called Kathe Ponna (ကသည်းပုဏ္ဏား) to advise and conduct court rituals.\n\n## Language and writing systems\nThe Meitei people speak the Meitei language (also known as the Manipuri language), a Tibeto-Burman language. Meitei is one of the languages with legal status in India, and was included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India in 1992.\nThere are many Meitei language movements, including classical language movement (predominantly in Manipur), associate official language movement (in Assam), linguistic purism movement (predominantly in Manipur), etc.\nHistorically and then after a long gap, presently, Meitei was written in the indigenous Meitei mayek script. The script was replaced by an alphabet based on the Bengali script in the early 18th century. The Meitei Mayek script has seen a revival in recent decades, and is now seen in street signs, schools, newspapers, and legislative proceeding records.\n\n### Literature\nAmong the heritage of diverse literary works in Meitei literature, the Khamba Thoibi Sheireng ((Meitei: ꯈꯝꯕ ꯊꯣꯏꯕꯤ ꯁꯩꯔꯦꯡ, lit. 'poem on Khamba Thoibi')), is regarded as the national epic of the Manipuris. It is an epic poem based on the ancient romantic adventure tale of Khamba and Thoibi. It is the best known magnum opus of Hijam Anganghal Singh. It is often considered to be the greatest of all the Meitei epic poems. At 39,000 verses, it is the longest Indian epic just after the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.\n\n## Culture\n\n\n### Architectural designs and sculptures\nSome of the significant intricate designs of the traditional Meitei architecture and sculptures are seen in various buildings and institutions, especially the temples of traditional Meitei religion: Hiyangthang Lairembi Temple, Pakhangba Temple, Kangla, Sanamahi Kiyong Temple, Thangjing Temple, Moirang, among many. Others include the Ima Keithel, Kangla Sanathong. include Some of the worthy to mention finely crafted sculptures are the Marjing Polo Statue, Kangla Sha sculptures, Statue of Meidingu Nara Singh.\n\n### Classical and folk dances, festivals and ritualistic theatres\nThe Lai Haraoba (Meitei for 'Merrymaking festival of the gods') is a traditional Meitei ritualistic theatrical festival, consisting of different dances, musical performances and carnivals in the temples and the streets. It's dedicated to the worship of the ancient Meitei gods and goddesses, who are categorised as the Umang Lai (Meitei for 'Sylvan deities') and Lam Lai (Meitei for 'Tutelary deities').\n\nThe Manipuri classical dance, also referred to as the  Manipuri Raas Leela (Meitei: Jagoi Raas, Raas Jagoi), is a jagoi and is one of the major Indian classical dance forms, originating from the historical Manipur Kingdom.\n\n### Theatre and cinema\nThe first Manipuri-language film, Matamgi Manipur, was released on 9 April 1972. Paokhum Ama (1983) is the first full-length colour feature film (according to the Academy's definition of a feature film) of Manipur and was directed by Aribam Syam Sharma. Lammei (2002) is the first Manipuri Video film to have a commercial screening at a theatre.\n\n### Religions and beliefs\nAccording to the 2011 census, 222,422 people (14.6 percent) follow the traditional Sanamahi religion of the Meitei people. The remainder (1,298,821 people, 85.3 percent) follow Hinduism and Christianity as per the census. The number of Christians is expected to be small. For example, the valley districts of Manipur, the major concentration of Meitei people, have about 3,000 Christians.\nMost Meiteis follow both Hinduism as well as Sanamahi religious traditions and rituals. For example, they worship Sanamahi in the south-west corners of their homes.\n\n### Calendar\nThe Meitei people follow a traditional calendar called Maliyafam Palcha Kumsing, which has 12 months and a 7-day week.\n\n### Cuisine\nRice, vegetables and fish are staple food of the Meiteis, although meat is also consumed;  but in traditional Meitei dishes meat is never used in non-vegetarian dishes. In traditional and cultural gatherings fish, snails, oysters, crabs, eels etc. are the only non-vegetarian elements used and a significant number of Meiteis follow it where meat is cooked and eaten outside the house if consumed. Rice is the main carbohydrate source in a Meitei dish; typically, it is served with vegetables, fish, freshwater snails, crabs, oysters, eels etc. Among the most famous species of fishes Manipuri Sareng (Wallago attu) or commonly known as Helicopter catfish, Hilsa (ilish Tenualosa ilisha), freshwater snails (pila (gastropod)) and edible oysters are considered a delicacy. The vegetables are either made as stews (Kangsoi) with less oil/no oil used in sauteing, or stir fried directly in oil with various added spices to make an oily spicy side dish (Kanghou). Roasted/Smoked and sun-dried fish or fried fresh fish is usually added in most of the stews and curry to impart special taste. The vegetables, herbs and fruits consumed in the region are more similar to those in Southeast/East/Central Asian, Siberian, Arctic, Polynesian and Micronesian cuisines such as Myanmar, Thailand, Inuit, etc. E.g. treebean (yongchak), galangal (loklei), culantro (awa phadigom), lime basil (mayangton), fishwort (tokningkhok) and many others, which are not cultivated in northern India. One of the most important ingredients in Meitei cooking is Ngari (fermented fish). Roasted ngari is used in the singju (a kind of salad), morok metpa (chilli chutney), eromba (boiled and mashed veggies with chillies). A variety of fermented bamboo shoots (soibum) as well as fresh bamboo shoots (Ushoi/Shoidon), and fermented soya beans (hawaijaar) also form an important part of Meitei cuisines. All meals are served with some fresh aromatic herbs on the side.\nA typical every day Meitei meal will have rice, vegetable or fish curry, a piquant side dish (either morok metpa or eromba accompanied with herbs), a champhut (a steamed/boiled vegetable with little sugar, e.g., carrot, pumpkin or cucumber slices or steamed/boiled mustard green stems, etc. without sugar), and a Kanghou. Meat cuisines are also popular amongst the Meiteis and some of the common meat curries are yen thongba (chicken curry) and nganu thongba (duck curry) and depending on regions, oak thongba (pork curry) and shan thongba (beef curry).\n\n### Subsistence\nThe Meitei are mainly agriculturists in which rice is a staple crop. However, they also grow mangoes, lemons, pineapples, oranges, guavas, and other fruits. Fishing is also common among the Meitei that can either be a profession or a hobby. Women tend to dominate the local markets as sellers of food items, textiles, and traditional clothing.\n\n## Associations and organisations\n\n\n### Cultural revivalist organisations\nArambai Tenggol is a socio-political organisation involved in the revival and preservation of indigenous Meitei culture, which has developed into an armed milita in the course of the 2023–2025 Manipur violence. Meira Paibi (Women torch bearers) is a Meitei women's social movement referred to as the \"guardians of civil society\".\n\n### Society-based\nNikhil Manipuri Mahasabha\n\n### Language-based\nManipuri Sahitya Parishad\nNaharol Sahitya Premee Samitee\n\n### Religion-based\nInternational Sanamahism Students' Association\nLainingthou Sanamahi Sana Pung\nLainingthou Sanamahi Temple Board\nSouth East Asia Cultural Organisation\n\n## Notable people\n\n\n## See also\nMeitei Brahmins\n2023 Manipur violence\nList of Meitei kings\nNingthouja dynasty\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nBrandt, Carmen (5 December 2017). \"Writing off domination: the Chakma and Meitei script movements\".

    "text": "# Middle Eastern cuisine\n\nMiddle Eastern cuisine includes a number of cuisines from the Middle East. Common ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates, sumac, chickpeas, mint, rice and parsley, and popular dishes include kebabs, dolmas, falafel, baklava, yogurt, doner kebab, shawarma and mulukhiyah.\n\n## Geography\nThe exact countries considered to be part of the Middle East are difficult to determine as the definition has changed over time and from source to source. Currently, the countries that are considered to comprise the Middle East are: Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, including the various ethnic, cultural, religious and ethno-linguistic groups within these nations.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n## History and influences\nThe Middle East incorporates the Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia) where wheat was first cultivated, followed by rye, barley, lentils, beans, pistachios, figs, pomegranates, dates and other regional staples. The domestication of sheep, goats and cattle took place in the region as well. Fermentation was also discovered there, in order to leaven bread and make beer in Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Additionally, the earliest written recipes come from that region.\nAs a crossroad between Europe, North Africa, and Asia, it has been a hub of food and recipe exchange. During the first Persian Empire (ca. 550–330 BCE), the foundation was laid for modern Middle-Eastern food when rice, poultry and fruits were incorporated into the local diet. Figs, dates and nuts were brought by merchants to conquered lands, and spices were brought from the Orient.\nThe region was also influenced by dumplings from Mongol invaders; turmeric and other spices from India; cloves, peppercorns and allspice from the Spice Islands; okra from Africa, and tomatoes from the New World.\nReligion has impacted the cuisine by making lamb the primary meat since both Jews and Muslims do not eat pork, although the cuisines of Christian peoples such as Assyrians, Armenians, Cypriots and Maronites can incorporate pork.\nThe Qur'an forbids alcohol consumption, which is why non-Islamic countries produce and export alcohol. Prime example would be wine made in Lebanon, in vineyards such as Château Ksara, Chateau Kefraya and Chateau Masaya which have gained international recognition. Château Ksara is also known for its arak ksarak. Al-Maza is Lebanon's primary brewery, and once it was the Middle East's only beer producer. Assyrian communities in Iraq, Turkey and Syria have long produced their own Wheat Beer, Wine and Arak.\nBefore the 1979 change of regime, Iran was noted for its wine production.\nUnder the Ottoman Empire, sweet pastries of paper-thin phyllo dough and thick coffee were brought and introduced to the region.\n\n## Elements\n\n\n### Grains\nGrains are the basis of the Middle Eastern diet, where wheat and rice are considered staple foods. Barley is also widely used in the region, and maize in addition has become common in some areas. Bread is a universal food eaten in some form by all classes at nearly every meal.\nIn addition to bread, wheat is also used in burghul and couscous. Burghul is cracked wheat made by partially cooking wheat grains in water, drying them in an oven (or in the sun), and breaking them into pieces. It is typically cooked in water with flavorings, much like rice.\nBurghul is also used in meat pies and as an ingredient in salads (notably in tabbouleh with chopped parsley, tomato, lemon, and oil). Freekeh is another common grain, made from immature green wheat.\nMany types of rice are produced and consumed in the region. Plain rice is served under grilled meats or in meat and vegetable stews. More complex rice dishes have layers of meat, vegetables, sauces, nuts, or dried fruits.\n\n### Flavorings\nButter and clarified butter (also known as smen), also ghee, are traditionally the preferred oil to cook in. Also, olive oil is prevalent in Mediterranean coastal areas, where Christians use it during the Lenten and other fasts which disallow meat and dairy products. and Jews use it instead of animal fats (such as butter) to avoid combining meat and dairy products.\nScented waters like rose water and orange flower water are frequently used in desserts, they are usually added into qatir; a syrup that is used in a significant portion of different Arab and Middle Eastern sweets, it is made by boiling sugar, scented water, and lemon juice together, the exact proportions vary by dish.\nMost regions in the Middle East use spices. A typical stew will include a small amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander. Black pepper is popular and chili peppers are used occasionally, especially as a sauce or as pickles. Parsley and mint are widely used in cooking and in salads.\nThyme and thyme blends (za'atar) are common among Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Israel, in addition to a mixture of dried thyme and sumac (crushed sour berries) which is prevalent at breakfast with oil and bread. Sumac is also sprinkled over grilled meat and garlic is frequently used in many dishes and salads.\n\n### Religious influence\nLamb and mutton are favored meats, since pork is prohibited by both Islamic and Jewish dietary laws, though Christian and other non Muslim or Jewish communities consume pork, and Chicken is also common in many Middle Eastern cuisines.\nGrilled meats (kebabs) are popular, with many regional varieties. The most popular is cubed lamb on skewers (shish kebab), and chicken that may also be grilled in the same fashion. Another extensive variety is kofta kebab, made from ground meat mixed with onions and spices, shaped around the skewer like a sausage and grilled. Kebabs are typically street or restaurant food, served with bread, salad and pickles, and are not usually prepared at home.\nMeat and vegetable stews are served with rice, bulgur, or bread. Kibbeh is a pie (or dumpling) made with meat and cereal.\nThe most popular kibbeh is made with ground meat (typically lamb) and burghul, worked together into a dough and stuffed with minced meat fried with onion, herbs and sometimes pine nuts, or almonds and raisins, prepared as individual small dumplings (shaped like a torpedo) or sliced like a cake and baked on an oven tray with two layers of stuffed dough.\nAnother variation of kibbeh is kibbeh naye, made by pounding raw meat and burghul with seasonings,  served with lemon juice and chili sauce for dipping.\n\n### Vegetables\nVegetables and pulses are staple foods, and are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and rice. Leaf vegetables include many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard. Root vegetables, such as onions, garlic, carrots, turnips, and beets, are also popular in the region.\nSquash, tomato, eggplant, and okra are distinctive elements of the region's cuisine. Eggplant is often sliced, fried and dressed with yogurt and garlic. Baba ghanoush is eggplant roasted over an open fire, mashed and dressed with tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, garlic, and cumin.\nTomato is the most ubiquitous ingredient in Middle-Eastern cookery, used fresh in salads, cooked in stews and broth, and grilled with kebab.\nBeans and pulses are crucial to the regional diet, second only to cereals. Fava beans are eaten both green and dried. Dried fava beans are boiled into ful medames, one of the most popular Egyptian domestic and street foods. As for mashed fava beans, they are dressed with oil, lemon, and chili. Similar dishes are found throughout the region. \n\nFalafel, which is popular in Europe and the United States, was originally made from dried fava beans formed into a rissole with herbs and spices and then fried. It is also made from chickpeas, or a blend of the two. Green fava are cooked like other green beans, boiled and dressed with oil or stewed with meat. Haricots and black-eyed peas are also well-known.\nLentils, split peas and chickpeas are widely used in soups and salads, with rice or meat. Hummus, made from chickpeas and tahini\n\n### Dishes\nStuffed vegetables, a dish associated with Middle Eastern cuisine, is commonly called dolma (Turkish for \"stuffed\") or mahshi. Grape leaves, chard, and cabbage are stuffed with rice, ground meat, pine nuts and spices, and stewed in oil and tomatoes. Many vegetables, such as squash, onion, tomato, eggplant, peppers and carrots, are similarly stuffed and stewed (or baked).\nMeze is popular throughout the Middle East. It consists of several small dishes (cheese, melon, nuts, salads and dips such as tabbouleh, hummus and mutabbal, and pickles) and more substantial items, such as grilled meat, kibbeh, and sausage.\nMiddle Easterners frequently consume milk, fresh or soured. Yogurt is commonly consumed plain, also used in cooking as in salad dressing, or diluted as a drink. Greek feta and halloumi are the region's most popular cheeses.\n\n## Beverages\nTurkish coffee is a beverage well known internationally. Thicker than other coffee, it is made by boiling finely-ground coffee in water and letting the grounds settle. During the 1980s, instant coffee became popular. The simple drink of coffee may serve the sole purpose of caffeine to many; however, it serves a multitude of traditional and cultural purposes in Iraq. Oftentimes, peace between families, marriage proposals, and significant life events are initiated by the serving of coffee. \nArabic coffee is another of type of coffee that is common throughout the middle east, it is boiled in a dallah or cezve, and often spiced with cardamom and/or other spices, and served without sugar.\nArak is a distilled, anise-flavored alcoholic drink, usually diluted with water and ice, and served in social gatherings with meze.\nSome Christians, such as the Assyrians, Armenians, Cypriots, and Maronites make their own beer and wine.\nQamar al-Din, a thick, sweet apricot beverage, is drunk by Muslims during Ramadan. Apricots are boiled with sugar and water until they are thick, and sun-dried on wooden planks. The dried fruit is then mixed with water and sugar.\nJallab is a fruit syrup made from grape molasses, dates and rose water served over crushed ice, sometimes with raisins or pine nuts.\nDoogh (or ayran) is a salted, yogurt-based beverage which is popular in Turkey and Iran.\n\n## Dining etiquette\n\n\n### Arab countries\nIn some Arab countries, especially in the Persian Gulf region, it is common for diners to take their food from a communal plate in the center of the table. They traditionally do not use forks or spoons; instead they scoop up the food with pita or a thumb and two fingers.\nIn Arabic culture, the left hand is considered unclean and even left-handed people eat with the right hand. A common exception, however, is that the left hand may hold a drinking glass when eating greasy food with the right.\nIt is proper etiquette to compliment the host on their food and hospitality, and to try every plate on the table. If a guest does not leave food on his plate, the host generally fills it immediately.\n\n### Turkey\nTea is usually served in curved glasses which are held by the lip to which water may be added. A cup of tea may be refilled if it is less than half full. An honored guest is expected to make a toast, usually soon after the host does or at the end of the meal. A toast is usually being made with a glass of wine, rakı, or just water.\nForks, spoons and knives are used. Sometimes, the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left, presenting the British-style. Smoking may be acceptable between courses of a dinner.\nIn formal situations and with more traditionalist company, the hosts sit at the head of the table, with the honored guest next to them on the side of the table which is farthest from the door.\nThe honored guest is served first, and then it's customary to serve from elder guests to younger, with a bias in favour of men. Diners do not begin eating until the oldest person at the table begins eating.\nIn some informal restaurants, dishes are ordered when desired (not all at once at the beginning of a meal). At informal restaurants a table may be shared, but diners are not required to converse.\nGuests may be required to remove their shoes. It is customary to say Afiyet olsun (\"May what you eat bring well-being\") before or after eating, and to say Elinize sağlik (\"Bless your hand\", a compliment for the manual, i.e. \"hand\" labour involved in cooking) to whoever prepared the meal after a meal.\n\n### Iraq\nThe working people of Iraq choose to start the day off with kahi, which is made of thin pastry dough.\n\n### Iran\nIranian dishes and foods are known for being rice-based and Iran has been popular for its wide rice production. Dishes are typically served as savory or sweet, rather than in courses.\nIn traditional Iranian restaurants, a large, low table lined with Persian rugs and with cushions around the sides is the setting for a meal. Diners sit cross-legged in a circle and food is served in the center (eaten with cutlery on separate plates). Tea is served in kamar baareek (\"narrow-waist\") glasses with sugar and Persian sweets.\nWhen entertaining dinner guests at home, it is seen as discourteous to serve just enough food, so food is prepared in large quantities. An important Persian practice is taarof (ritual politeness) where if a person is offered food or drink, they will initially politely decline. Only after the host has offered repeatedly, it is accepted and that is to avoid appearing greedy.\n\n## Globalization\nIn 2017, Middle-Eastern cuisine was reportedly one of the most popular and fastest-growing ethnic cuisines in the US. Dishes such as hummus and falafel are becoming increasingly common in restaurants across the United States.\nMiddle-Eastern cuisine is often misrepresented as simply interchangeable with Mediterranean food in Western markets.\n\n### Criticism of the label\nChef Fadi Kattan has criticized the label, saying \"Sadly we self-orientalize under labels such as Middle-Eastern, Levantine or Mediterranean cuisine, which don’t mean anything, to me.\", he goes on to say that some cuisines that are both labelled as \"Middle eastern\" or \"Mediterranean\" have very little in common, such as those of  Northern Algeria and Marseille.\nAuthor Reem Kassis, writing for The Atlantic, states that some restaurants in cities like New York and London are beginning to \"differentiate themselves by labeling their cuisine Lebanese or Palestinian or Syrian\", as opposed to the \"Middle Eastern\" label made possible by Globalization, citing cultural appropriation as a possible reason.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\n Middle Eastern cuisine travel guide from Wikivoyage",

Mizos traditionally eat rice as their staple food.\n\n## Overview\nThe cuisine of Mizoram shares characteristics to other regions of Northeast India and North India. Rice is the staple food of Mizoram, while Mizos love to add non-vegetarian ingredients in every dish. Fish, chicken, pork and beef are popular meats among Mizos. Dishes are cooked in any available oil. Meals tend to be blander with less oil and more vegetables. Most Mizos love eating boiled vegetables along with rice but the younger generation tends to like fried and spicy food; food from other cultures are also a popularity among many young Mizo. Rice is known as 'Chaw' and Curry as 'Hme', a popular dish is bai, made from boiling vegetables (the ingredients tend to differ from household to household) with bekang (fermented soybeans similar to Japanese Nattō) or sa-um, a fermented pork, and served with rice. Sawhchiar is another common dish, made of rice and cooked with beef, pork or chicken.\n\n## Dishes\nThe staple food of most of the Mizo people is rice, with meat and vegetables served on the side, ranging from the homely bai, a simple vegetable stew, non veg stew with sesame, garlic, onion and herbs.\n\n### Side dishes\nBai – combination of several herbs cooked with string beans and edible ferns.\nRep – smoked meat (fish, chicken, pork or beef) mixed with flavors of chilies, local herbs and fresh leafy greens\nChhum han – mixed steamed vegetables.\nHmarcha rawt - tangy and spicy chilli chutney\nDal\nBekang - fermented soya beans similar to Japanese Nattō\n\n### Lunch\nLunch in a Mizo home differs from house to house.

    "text": "# Momo (food)\n\nMomos are a type of steamed filled dumpling in Tibetan and Nepali cuisine that is also popular in neighbouring Bhutan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. The majority of Tibetan momos are half-moon in shape like jiaozi, while Nepali momos are normally round like baozi. Momos are usually served with a sauce known as achar influenced by the spices and herbs used within many South Asian cuisines. It can also be used in soup, as in jhol momo and mokthuk.\n\n## Origin\n\"Momo\", as written, is a phonetic transcription of the Tibetan word མོག་མོག (Wylie: mog mog, Tibetan pronunciation: [moʔ˩˨.ˈmoʔ]). It is possible that this Tibetan word is borrowed from the Chinese term momo (馍馍), a name traditionally used in northwestern Chinese dialects for wheat steamed buns and bread. The word mo (馍) itself means wheat flour food products or mantou (馒头), steamed buns. Historically, Chinese names for steamed buns did not distinguish between those with or without fillings until the term baozi (包子) emerged during the Song Dynasty between the tenth and thirteenth century. However, in eastern regions of China such as Jiangsu and Shanghai, mantou continues to carry both meanings in modern day. The history of dumplings in China shows that dumplings were popular during the Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 AD). Dumplings dated between 499 AD and 640 AD were found in the Astana Cemetery in northwestern modern-day China.\nLegend holds that 7th-century Nepali princess Bhrikuti, who introduced Buddhism to Tibet, also introduced momos there. Despite that, it is generally believed that the concept of dumplings was carried from China by the Mongols in the 13th century. As for the Himalayan momo, similar to the history of Korean mandu, the history of momos in Nepal dates back to as early as the fourteenth century. It is not quite known whether it spread from the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal to Tibet or the other way around. Because this dish was initially popular among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that traveling Nepali Newar merchants took the recipe from Tibet, where they traded, and brought it home to Nepal. In Tibet, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak and occasionally potatoes and cheese. Traditional Tibetan momos are quite different from Nepalese ones, as the former was made with a thicker dough and with little to no spices except salt.\nAfter arriving in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the meat was more often chicken, and mixed vegetable momos were introduced to feed the large population of vegetarian Hindus. A large number of Tibetans emigrated to India following the 1959 Tibetan uprising, bringing their recipes for momos with them. Unproven, but substantiated by the dates and references to momos in colloquial references, the civil war in Nepal pushed out the Nepali diaspora to seek a livelihood in India, which further increased the prevalence of Himalayan style momos in the southern half of India especially in the cities of Chennai and Bangalore.\n\n## Production\nThe earliest Tibetan dumplings were made of highland barley flour as the outer covering, and beef and mutton as the stuffing. Nowadays, a simple white-flour-and-water dough is generally preferred to make the outer covering of momos. Sometimes, a little yeast or baking soda is added to give a more doughy texture to the finished product.\nTraditionally, momos are prepared with ground/minced meat, potatoes, and leek filling. Nowadays, the fillings have become more elaborate and momos are prepared with virtually any combination of ground meat, vegetables, tofu, mushrooms, paneer cheese, soft chhurpi (local hard cheese) and vegetable and meat combinations.\n\nMeat: Different types of meat fillings are popular in different regions. In Nepal, Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan common meat fillings are pork, chicken, goat and water buffalo. In the Himalayan region of Nepal and India, lamb and yak meat are more common. Minced meat is combined with any or all of the following: onions/shallots, garlic, ginger and cilantro/coriander. Some people also add finely puréed tomatoes and soy sauce.\nVegetables: Finely chopped cabbage, carrot, soy granules, potato, flat bean (lilva kachori) or chayote (iskush) are used as fillings in Nepal.\nCheese: Usually fresh cheese (paneer) or the traditional soft chhurpi is used. This variety is common in Eastern Nepal.\nKhoa: Momos filled with milk solids mixed with sugar are popular as a dessert in the Kathmandu Valley.\nThe dough is rolled into small circular flat pieces. The filling is enclosed in the circular dough cover either in a round pocket or a half-moon or crescent shape. Fatty meat is preferred because it produces flavourful, juicy momos. A little oil is sometimes added to the lean ground/minced meat to keep the filling moist and juicy. The dumplings are then cooked by steaming over a soup (either a stock based on bones or vegetables) in a momo-making utensil called mucktoo. Momos may also be pan-fried or deep-fried after being steamed.\n\n## Variations\nMomos are traditionally steamed but can also be deep-fried or pan-fried and cooked in soup. They are usually served with chilli garlic sauce and pickled daikon in Tibet. In Nepal, popular dipping sauces include tomato-based chutneys or sesame or peanut or soybean-based sauces called achar. Sauces can be thick or thin in consistency depending on the eatery. \n\nMomos may be used in soups. Jhol momo (Nepali: झोल मोमो) is a Nepali soup consisting of momos in a spicy vegetable broth called jhol achar, which contains tomatoes, sesame seeds, chillies, cumin, and coriander. It is commonly eaten in Kathmandu in the winter. Mokthuk, from Tibet, is a variation of the thukpa soup using small momos.\nOther variations of momos include:\n\nC-momo, steamed or fried then served in chili sauce.\nDhapu momo, from Chinese da bao (大包), or \"big bun\", also known as \"Tibetan momo\", a Nepali dumpling that is typically larger and flatter than other versions of momos. This was possibly introduced to Nepal through two routes. One was through Myanmar along the eastern Himalayas, and the other was by the Chinese who immigrated to Kolkata, India one or two hundred years ago.\nGonga momo (Tibetan: སྒོ་ང་མོག་མོག, Wylie: sgo nga mog mog), a wheat and egg fried dough dumpling filled with meat paste.\nGreen momo, a steamed vegetarian dumpling stuffed with vegetables, cabbage and green beans.\nHoentay, a Bhutanese dumpling made from buckwheat dough wrapper mixed with spinach and cheese.\nKothey momo, from Chinese guotie (锅贴), a pan-fried version of the momo. The dumpling is first filled with meat as well as vegetables and spices. It is first steamed then fried and then served in dipping sauce.\nOpen momo, another Nepali addition to the variant in that it has a distinct shape which has open holes on the top that can be used to add various sauces and spices.\nSadheko momo, a momo salad with onions and tomatoes, herbs, and spices.\nShoko momo (Tibetan: ཞོག་ཁོག་མོག་མོག, Wylie: zhog khog mog mog), a Tibetan variant that is prepared using mashed potato with dough, shaped into balls, with a minced meat filling, served with bread crumbs.\nTingmo (Tibetan: ཀྲིན་མོག, Wylie: krin mog), a type of steamed bread made from flour, yeast and water. Tingmo is a soft and fluffy bread served with savoury dishes such as stews or curries. Unlike other versions of momos, tingmo does not contain any type of filling.\nShamo (Tibetan: ཤ་མོག, Wylie: sha mog), a Tibetan dumpling stuffed with beef or mutton.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nList of dumplings\nBaozi\nJiaozi\nMantou\nWonton\nKhinkali\nTibetan diaspora\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Mozambican cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Mozambique represents a mixture of indigenous foods and cooking practices, coupled with outside influences from Indian Ocean trade and Portuguese colonization.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Indigenous foods and techniques\nPrior to Portuguese colonization and the Columbian exchange, millet and sorghum were the primary grains in Mozambique. They retain some presence, though maize has largely displaced them as a staple food over the last few decades.\n\n### Portuguese influence: new crops\nMozambican cuisine has deeply been influenced by the Portuguese, who introduced new crops, flavorings, and cooking methods. The importation of new crops has arguably had the most significant effect of any Portuguese influence; maize, tomatoes, (sweet) potatoes, peppers, and cassava are all non-native crops that have become core components of the Mozambican diet.\nCooking techniques with Portuguese influence include the refogado, a base of tomatoes, onions, garlic, and piri-piri sauteed in vegetable oil. Sweet coconut puddings and candies are also common, possibly as a Portuguese influence.\n\n### Indian (Ocean) influence: curry and seafood\n\"Curry\" is considered one of Mozambique's national dishes, but is loosely defined as some combination of shrimp, fish, meat, or vegetables cooked in a sauce, that does not necessarily contain curry powder. Goanese influences (from Goa, a fellow Portuguese colony in India) have connected curry and coconut in Mozambican food. Peanut can also be used as a thickener for curries, especially in southern Mozambique.\nOther non-native crops that were imported from India and further east include oranges, lemons, a range of spices, and possibly sugarcane and bananas.\n\n## Common food and drink\nThe staple food for many Mozambicans is xima (shi-mah), a thick porridge made from maize/corn flour. Cassava and rice are also eaten as staple carbohydrates. All of these are served with sauces of vegetables, meat, beans or fish. Other typical ingredients include cashew nuts, onions, bay leaves, garlic, coriander, paprika, pepper, red pepper, sugar cane, corn, millet, sorghum and potatoes.\nOne of the most well-known Mozambican dishes is known as matapa, a stew dish made of cassava leaves, ground peanuts, onions, tomatoes, red chili flakes, sometimes with seafood like shrimp, and commonly served over rice.\n\nAs Mozambique is a coastal nation, the cuisine includes a lot of seafood, and many dishes have Indian influences from pre- and post-colonization Indian Ocean trade contacts. Curry dishes (caril de camarao, shrimp curry), and chamussas (the Mozambican version of samosa) are common Mozambican dishes with Indian influences. Many dishes are also made with coconut milk, including Frango a Zambeziana, a spicy chicken dish with coconut milk. Rice is a common ingredient. A bolo polana is a cake made of cashew and potatoes.\n\n### Major dishes\nmango or lemon achar: salt-fermented fruit with piri-piri\nbebinca: a dense layer cake\nmatapa: a stew of cassava leaves and peanut/coconut milk\nmucapata: rice, beans, and coconut milk\nxiguinha: a thick mixture of cassava, peanut, and coconut milk, to which other ingredients can be added\ntocossado: fish baked in a chili, mango, and tomato sauce\nmatata: a dish of clams, nuts, and greens\npiri-piri sauce: a chili sauce based on the piri-piri pepper, with oil, garlic, and lemon\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nAfrican cuisine\nEast African cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\nFood in Mozambique",

It had a hybridized, pluralistic Persianate culture. As such, Mughlai cuisine introduced Central Asian styles of food to Hindustan, and new methods of cooking. They combined these with local spices and vegetables to create a distinctive cuisine for the Mughal court.\n\nSo, for example, biryani developed in the royal Mughal kitchens in India, combining the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia with the Persian pilau style of aromatic garnished rice and the Persian method of marinating meat in yoghurt.\n\n### Mughal era cookery books\nDecorated Indo-Persian cookery books and culinary manuscripts adorned the personal libraries of the Mughal elite.\nA popular culinary work from the Mughal period was the Nuskha-i-Shahjahani, (\"Shah Jahan's Recipes\") said to be a record of dishes prepared for the court of the Emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1627-1658). This Persian manuscript has ten chapters, on nānhā (breads), āsh-hā (pottages), qalīya (stews) and dopiyāza (meat with onions), bharta  (mashed vegetables), zerbiryān (a kind of layered rice-based dish), pulāʾo, kabāb (kebabs), harīsa (savoury porridge), shishranga and ḵẖāgīna (omelette), and khichṛī (rice with lentils); the final chapter involves murabbā (jams), achār (pickles), pūrī (fried bread), fhīrīnī (sweets), ḥalwā (warm pudding), and basic recipes for the preparation of yoghurt, panīr (Indian curd cheese) and the colouring of butter and dough.\nA well-known cookery book from the time of the emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707) or some years later was the Ḵẖulāṣat-i Mākūlāt u Mashrūbāt (\"Compendium of Things Eaten and Drunk\"). Each of its 40 chapters covers one type of dish, starting with breads (naan, kulcha) and then covering kinds of savoury dishes including qalīya, dopiyāza, bharta, kabāb, khichṛī, zerbiryān, and achār. One chapter covers sālanhā-i hindī (dishes based on Hindustani sauces). \nSweetmeats described in the Ḵẖulāṣat-i Mākūlāt u Mashrūbāt include phirni and shir berenj (types of rice and milk pudding), falooda (a cold vermicelli dessert), panbhatta (sherbet with fried soaked rice),  malida (sweet dough), and several types of sweet dumplings, namely saṃbosa, pūrī, gulgula, and khajur.\nThe Alwān-E-Niʿmat (\"Colours of the Table\") from the reign of Jahangir (r. 1605–1627), was dedicated entirely to sweetmeats. It describes nan ḵẖata'i (a biscuit-like bread, sometimes with almond: nan ḵẖata'i badami); sweetened puri breads and fried sweet samosa snacks; spherical laddu sweets;  and halva. The samosas and puris could be cooked slowly in a sealed pot (dam cooking).\n\n### Western reports of Mughal era cuisine\nThe Dutch East India Company merchant Francisco Pelsaert recorded that a wealthy Indian's feast during Jahangir's reign was composed of many dishes for the guests. Meat dishes included aeshelia (spiced); dupiyaza (with onion); and roasts. Garnished rice dishes included both pollaeb (pilau) and brinj (biryani). Accompaniments included zueyla (spiced cakes of wheat).\nWesterners' reactions to pilau in the 19th century varied. Collingham described pilau as one of the two standard dishes in Central Asian fare (the other being kebabs). The Hungarian linguist Ármin Vámbéry found pilau excellent. The American diplomat Eugene Schuyler, on the other hand, called it \"pleasant but ... too greasy and insipid\".\nEdward Terry, British ambassador to Jahangir's court (1615–1619), wrote a description of a Mughlai dinner. Fifty different dishes, each in a silver bowl, were set in front of the guests. He noted that the rice was dyed in colours such as purple and green, and much better cooked than in Britain; he remarked that, flavoured with \"a little green Ginger and Pepper, and Butter, ... tis very good.\" As for the meat, it was stewed with herbs, spices, onions, ginger, and butter, creating \"a food that is exceedingly pleasing to all Palates\": in other words, Collingham writes, a curry.\n\n### Modern era Mughlai\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Mughlai cuisine has been adapted by restaurants and roadside food stalls for a mass market, resulting in a single dish of marinated chicken or meat, cooked in a thick sauce based on tomato or cream, and accompanied by flatbreads or garnished rice dishes. \nIn Britain, the Mughal Emperor Babur's (r. 1526–1530) chicken tikka (tandoor-grilled yoghurt-marinated pieces of chicken meat) was transformed in the late 20th century by the addition of tomato, cream, and spices into chicken tikka masala.\n\n## Cuisine\n\n\n### Main dishes\nThe tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and are often associated with a distinctive aroma and the use of ground and whole spices. A Mughlai meal is an elaborate buffet of as many as a hundred main course dishes with a variety of accompaniments. The distinctive dishes of Mughlai cuisine include main courses such as biryani (aromatic spiced and garnished rice with pieces of meat), keema matar (minced lamb and pea curry), kofta chorba (soup with meatballs), murgh kali mirch (chicken black pepper curry), and mutton rogan josh (Kashmiri red meat in an aromatic sauce), as well as vegetarian options like shahi kaju aloo (sautéed potatoes in a cashew and curd curry).\nKebabs, first introduced during the Delhi Sultanate, were developed from simple grilled pieces of meat into a delicate dish flavoured with aromatic spices and dried fruits. Korma is a mild curry with a thick sauce made by braising meat or vegetables in yoghurt and spices. Murgh musallam is a dish of marinated spiced chicken. Pasanda is marinated meat in a creamy sauce with yoghurt, nuts, and mild spices.\n\nAccompaniments include Mughlai paratha, a Bengali flatbread stuffed with minced meat or egg.\n\n### Desserts\nMughlai desserts include anjeer halwa (fig halva); gulab jamun (cheese and rice fritters in a scented syrup); falooda (vermicelli in a thickened syrup); seviyan (vermicelli with milk, clarified butter, rose-water and almonds); phirni (a rice-based dessert); barfi (milk solids cooked to a fudge with sugar); and shahi tukra (a rich bread pudding with dried fruits and cardamom). The Mughals prized fruits including several varieties of indigenous Indian mangoes as desserts.\nA characteristic Mughal drink is sherbet. The food writer Lizzie Collingham states that the Mughals found mangoes good for this purpose, and gives a recipe for green mango sherbet.\n\n## See also\nBangladeshi cuisine\nBengali cuisine\nCuisine of Karachi\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nCollingham, Lizzie (2006).

Most Muhajirs have traditionally been based in Karachi, hence the city being known for Muhajir tastes in its cuisine. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. Muhajirs clung to their old established habits and tastes, including a numberless variety of dishes and beverages.\nThis cuisine has been greatly affected by the urban culture of Muhajirs, and the Muhajir culinary dishes are mostly prepared by modern cooking appliances.\n\n## Origins\nMuhajir cuisine is originally a blend of Uttar Pradesh, Bengali, Delhi, Hyderabadi, Bihari and Rajasthani cuisines. It is mostly the same as the cuisine of North Indian populations who adopted it from the Mughals. With the Muhajir peoples integration into Karachi, many local cuisines were fused into the Muhajir cuisine.\n\n## Style of cooking\nThere are many styles of cooking used by Muhajirs. Modern methods such as cooking on gas cookers are the most famous. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. The Tandoori style is mostly used by Muhajirs from Rajasthan, Delhi and Agra where the tandoor is thought to be originated. A tandoor may be used to bake many different types of flatbread. Some of the most common are tandoori roti, tandoori naan, tandoori laccha paratha, missi roti, laffa, and tandoori kulcha.\n\n## Distinguishable features\nThe Mughal and Indo-Iranian heritage played an influential role in the making of their cuisine, having taste vary from mild to spicy and is often associated with aroma. In comparison to other native Pakistani dishes, Muhajir cuisine tends to use stronger spices and flavors. Most of a dastarkhawan dining table include chapatti, rice, dal, vegetable and meat curry. Special dishes include biryani, qorma, kofta, seekh kabab, Nihari and Haleem, Nargisi Koftay, Kata-Kat, Rogani Naan, Naan, Sheer-qurma (sweet), qourma, Chai, paan and Hyderabadi cuisine, and other delicacies associated with Muhajir culture.

    "text": "# Mulligatawny\n\nMulligatawny ( ) is a soup which originated from rasam in Tamil cuisine, though much transformed during its adoption into Anglo-Indian cuisine. The name originates from the Tamil words miḷagu (மிளகு 'black pepper'), and thanneer (தண்ணீர், 'water'); literally, \"pepper-water\". \nMain ingredients commonly include chicken, mutton, and lentils.\n\n## History\nMulligatawny was popular in India by the end of the 18th century, and by the 19th century it began to appear in cookbooks of the day, with each cook (or cookbook) featuring its own recipe. Recipes for mulligatawny varied greatly at that time and over the years (e.g., Maria Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery contained three versions), and later versions of the soup included British modifications that included meat, although the local Madras (modern Chennai) recipe on which it was based did not. Early references to it in English go back to 1784. In 1827, William Kitchiner wrote that it had become fashionable in Britain:\n\nMullaga-Tawny signifies pepper water. The progress of inexperienced peripatetic Palaticians has lately been arrested by this outlandish word being pasted on the windows of our Coffee-Houses; it has, we believe, answered the \"Restaurateurs'\" purpose, and often excited John Bull, to walk in and taste—the more familiar name of Curry Soup—would, perhaps, not have had sufficient of the charms of novelty to seduce him from his much-loved Mock-Turtle.\nIt is a fashionable Soup and a great favourite with our East Indian friends, and we give the best receipt we could procure for it.\n\nIn 1878, Arthur Robert Kenney-Herbert (1840–1916), under the pen name Wyvern, wrote in his popular Culinary Jottings that \"really well-made mulligatunny is ... a thing of the past.\" He wrote that this simple recipe prepared by poorer natives of Madras as made by \"Mootoosamy\" was made by pounding:\n\na dessert-spoonful of tamarind, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tea-spoonful of mustard seed, a salt-spoonful of fenugreek seed, twelve black peppercorns, a tea-spoonful of salt, and six leaves of karay-pauk. When worked to a paste, he adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an hour. While this is going on, he cuts up two small onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in dessert-spoonful of ghee till they begin to turn brown, when he strains the pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. The pepper-water is, of course, eaten with a large quantity of boiled rice, and is a meal in itself. The English, taking their ideas from this simple composition, added other condiments, with chicken, mutton, &c., thickened the liquid with flour and butter, and by degrees succeeded in concocting a soupe grasse of a decidedly acceptable kind.\n\n## Ingredients\nAccording to The Oxford Companion to Food, the simplest version of the soup included chicken or mutton, fried onion, and spices. More complex versions may call for \"a score of ingredients\". Versions originating in southern India commonly called for lentils.\n\n## See also\nList of soups\n\n## Footnotes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta. The dish can also be served with ragi, a cereal.\n\n## Ingredients\nCommon ingredients used to prepare mutton curry include: mutton or goat meat, salt, turmeric powder, mustard oil, ginger garlic paste, dahi (yogurt), assortment of spices, onion, chilli, tomato, and coriander leaves.\n\n## Variations\n\n\n### Odisha\nIn Odisha, mutton curry is always made of khasi goat meat (meat of young castrated male goat). There are many varieties of goat meat curries prepared in Odisha. Simple and flavorful ingredients are used to prepare the curry and usually served with roti, naan or in Western Odisha, puffed rice (mudhi). Some of the popular curries are:\n\nMutton Kashā (Odia: ମାଂସ କଷା, romanized: Māṅså Kåṣā)\nMutton Curry (Odia: ମାଂସ ତରକାରୀ, romanized: Māṅså Tårkāri)\nMutton Roasted in Bamboo or Bamboo Mutton (Odia: ବାଉଁଶ ପୋଡ଼ା ମାଂସ, romanized: Bãuśå Poṛā Māṅså)\nMutton Roasted in Leaf (Odia: ପତ୍ର ପୋଡ଼ା ମାଂସ, romanized: Påtrå Poṛā Māṅså)\nMutton in Clay Pot (Odia: ମାଟି ହାଣ୍ଡି ମାଂସ, romanized: Māṭi Hāṇḍi Māṅså)\nMutton Besar (Odia: ମାଂସ ବେସର, romanized: Māṅså Besår)\nWhile mutton curry is usually eaten with rice, in Western Odisha, Mangsa Kashā is particularly relished with mudhi (puffed rice). Mangsa Kashā is said to be the predecessor of the popular Bengali goat curry dish known as Kosha Mangsho most probably introduced by the Odia cooks who moved to West Bengal during the British rule to work in the kitchens of Bengali families.\n\n### Bihar\nMutton is typically cooked in Bihar in curried form. In addition to fish and chicken, mutton is common in Bihari cuisine. Mutton curry is traditionally served with Malpua on Holi, while it is eaten with rice in a routine everyday meal. In Champaran, mutton is cooked in a sealed earthen pot as a one-pot curry.\n\n### Gujarat\nMutton curry has a special place in Surati cuisine. A rich mutton dish known as Tapelu which finds its origins in the kitchens of the Surati Khatri community, is often cooked in large batches, especially during festivities. Goat offal also finds a place in the cuisine of Surat.\n\n### West Bengal\nKosha mangsho is the Bengali version of mutton curry. It traditionally has less juice and more gravy than mutton curries eaten in other parts of India. This dish is prepared in a kosha style, which involves retaining the mutton's flavor and moisture using slow cooking and sautéeing methods.\nKosha mangsho is traditionally prepared as part of the celebration of Kali Puja, a festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, celebrated on the New Moon day of the Hindu month Kartik.\nRailway mutton curry is a British Raj colonial-era dish that was served on long-distance trains. The dish was served with dinner rolls. Tamarind was originally used to extend its shelf life. Some restaurants serve the dish in present-day times, such as Oh! Calcutta! restaurant in Kolkata, India. Railway mutton curry is prepared using a coconut milk base.\n\n### Maharashtra\nBlack Mutton curry (also referred to as konkani black mutton) is a dish that is prepared from goat or lamb meat, charred coconuts, and a signature spice blend. The regional dish originated in the Konkani district of Maharashtra, India.\nBlack Mutton curry was originally made by preparing a black spice paste consisting of charred coconuts, onions and peppers with spices which was then cooked low and slow in a cast iron wok. The cooked paste was added with the mutton along with fresh herbs and spices in an earthen pot and cooked low and slow till tender. The curry is typically served with breads such as Bhakari, Chapati, Pav or rice.\nThe dish utilizes a unique blend of spices called the Maharashtrian garam masala, which consists of cardamom, nutmeg, khus khus (poppy seeds), saunth (dried ginger), and many other Mughlai spices which lend the black mouton an intoxicating flavor and a robust color.\n\n### Counterfeit variations\nIn 2012, in the Midlands, England, trading standards officers working undercover went to twenty restaurants that were randomly chosen and bought 39 lamb curry and kebab dishes. Four of the dishes contained no lamb, instead using a mixture that contained beef, pork or chicken. In the investigation, it was found that only three lamb curries out of the nineteen tested contained only lamb. Most were found to consist of a mixture of lamb with beef or chicken. Additionally, all of the twenty lamb kebabs that were sampled contained meats in addition to lamb that was mixed with it, such as beef, pork or chicken.\n\n## See also\nList of Indian dishes\nCuisine of Odisha\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\n\"From Railway Mutton curry to Bedmi-aloo: When railway food was an affair to remember\".

    "text": "# Naga cuisine\n\nNaga cuisine consists of foods from or commonly eaten by the Naga people in Northeast India and Kachin, Sagaing Region of Myanmar,  or by the Naga diaspora. Each ethnic group of the Nagas prepares its own unique style of cuisines. It most notably features rice, meats and leaf vegetables. Meat prepared by the Nagas are often smoked, dried or fermented. While Naga cuisine is part of South Asian cuisine due to national boundaries, it is closer to Southeast Asian cuisine, especially Burmese cuisine and Northern Thailand cuisine.\n\n## Overview\nThe various ethnic group of Nagas have their own cuisines, but often exchange recipes. The cuisines have developed as a result of long-term relationship that the communities have shared with their land and Indigenous wisdom passed through the generations. The food culture is based on agro-climatic conditions, availability of edible forest resources, customary beliefs, cultural practices and taboos, social restrictions, and socio-economic conditions.\nA typical Naga meal consists of rice, a meat dish, one or two boiled vegetable dishes including the leaves, and a chutney/pickle (Tathu). Rice is the main carbohydrate source in the Naga diet and this region produces a number of prized rice varieties, but rice is also imported into the region from other states. Dried/smoked meat is an important ingredient in Naga cuisine and has practical significance for sustenance farmers/foragers and hunters. Smoked meat is often kept for an entire year to provide food security for individual families. Nagas prefer boiled edible organic leaves and wild forage which makes up a large part of the diet of many Naga regions.\nNaga food tends to be hot and there are several different varieties of Chili in the Naga areas. The most notable being Naga Morich and Bhut jolokia. The ginger used in the Naga cuisine is spicy, aromatic and is different from the common ginger. Garlic and ginger leaves are also used in cooking meat dishes. Sichuan pepper is also a popular spice used by the Nagas.\n\n## Ingredients\nNaga ingredients are acquired in diverse ways: cultivation, forage, fermentation, and trade.\n\nRice: It is the staple grain of the Nagas. Its cultivation covers 70 percent of the total cultivated area.\nBamboo shoot: Nagas use bamboo shoot in various forms: fresh, dried, and fermented. It is considered especially important for the Lotha Naga tribe while all communities use it for everyday cooking. Most tribes also consider the Lotha community to prepare the best bamboo shoot products. The bamboo species Dendrocalamus hamiltonii grows abundantly in the Lotha area, i.e., Wokha district, and along the historical Dimapur to Kohima road.^ The Lothas have different varieties of fermented bamboo shoots, namely Rhuju, Rhujak, Rhujon, Rhuyen and Rhujonphen.\n\n## Dishes\nAkhuni (axone), a fermented soybean product often served with smoked pork and beef. It is a Sümi Naga speciality.\nAkibiye is a thick gravy made with colocasia and bamboo shoots, mainly by the Sümi Nagas.\nAnishi are fermented taro leaves made into patties and then smoked over the fire or sun-dried. It is an Ao Naga speciality.\nFermented bamboo shoots, locally known as bastenga, are made from tender shoots of the bamboo tree and often served with fish and pork. It is prepared most notably by the Lotha Nagas.\nDog meat is a delicacy among Nagas. It is used in various dishes.\nGalho, also known as zawo, a common Angami and Chakhesang Naga speciality, is made from a mixture of rice, vegetables and various meats.\nMesü is a meat dish cooked with its blood. Usually made of pork or beef, it is popular among the Angamis.\nSmoked meat is produced by keeping the meat above a fire or hanging on the kitchen wall for a day to two weeks or longer.\nYongchak (Parkia speciosa) are long treebeans often eaten roasted over coals, and are often traded in bunches.\n\n## Beverages\nThuthse is a fermented drink made from sticky rice. It is the traditional drink of the Angami and Chakhesang Nagas.\nZutho is another fermented drink made from rice. It has a light and dull taste compared to thuthse, which is thicker, stronger and sweeter.\n\n## See also\nRovi Chasie (2003, expanded 2023), Naga Cuisine: Ethnic Flavours.\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

Preparations of ceviche are endemic in Peru and Ecuador, while a thin cut of beef known as matambre is considered close to being a national dish in Paraguay. Stews of meat, plantains, and root vegetables are the platos nacionales of several countries in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean: Colombian ajiaco, as well as the sancocho of the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Panama, are examples of platos nacionales. Janer (2008) observes that this sharing of the same plato nacional by different countries calls into question the idea that every country has a unique national dish that is special to that country; she states that cuisine does not respect national and geopolitical borders.\nThe identification of Latin American national dishes is stronger among expatriate communities in North America. In Latin American countries, the plato nacional is usually part of the cuisine of rural and peasant communities, and not necessarily part of the everyday cuisine of city dwellers. In expatriate communities, the dish is strongly reclaimed in order to retain the sense of national identity and ties to one's homeland, and is proudly served in homes and restaurants. By this show of national identity, the community can resist social pressures that push for homogenization of many ethnically and culturally diverse communities into a single all-encompassing group identity, such as Latino or Hispanic American.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## Drink\n\n\n### National drinks\nA national drink is a distinct beverage that is strongly associated with a particular country, and can be part of their national identity and self-image. These drinks can be either alcoholic or non-alcoholic. Alcoholic national drinks might be spirits consumed straight (like vodka in Russia), but more often, they are mixed drinks (such as caipirinhas in Brazil and Singapore Slings in Singapore), beer, or wine. Non-alcoholic national drinks include Coca-Cola in the United States, boba tea in Taiwan, and Thai iced tea in Thailand.\nSeveral factors can qualify a beverage as a national drink:\n\nRegional ingredients and popularity: The drink is made from locally sourced ingredients and is commonly consumed, such as mango lassi in India, which uses dahi, a traditional yogurt.\nUnique local ingredients: The beverage contains an exotic ingredient that is unique to the region.\nCultural tradition: The drink plays a significant role in festive traditions and cultural heritage.\nOfficial promotion: The country actively promotes the drink as a national symbol.\nChoosing a single national drink can be challenging for some countries due to their diverse cultures and populations, such as Mexico or India. Conversely, some beverages, like pisco sour, are claimed by more than one country—both Peru and Chile, in this case.\n\n## See also\nIndex of sociology of food articles\nGastronationalism\nTraditional food\n\n\n== References ==",

Other foods have hybrid Tibetan and Indian influence.\nChow mein is a Nepali favorite in modern times based on Chinese-style stir-fried noodles. It is one of the most beloved everyday staple lunches in Nepali households.\n\n## Types\n\n\n### Khas cuisine\nDal-bhat-tarkari is the standard meal eaten twice daily traditionally by the Khas people. However, with land suitable for irrigated rice paddies in short supply, other grains supplement or even dominate. Wheat becomes unleavened flat bread (roti or chapati). Maize (makai), buckwheat (fapar), barley (jau), or millet (kodo) become porridge-like (dhido or ato). Tarkari can be spinach and fresh greens (sag), fermented and dried greens (gundruk or sinki), white radish (mula), potatoes (alu), green beans (simi), tomatoes (golbeda), cauliflower (kauli), cabbage (bandakopi), pumpkin (farsi), etc.\nThe climate of the hilly region remains moderate throughout the year. This kind of climate is perfect for horticulture. Fruits traditionally grown in the hills include mandarin orange (suntala), kaffir lime (kagati), lemon (kaagati), Asian pear (nashpati), and bayberry (kaphal), mangoes (aanp), apples (syauu), peach (aaru), plum (aalcha or aarubakhara), apricot (kurpani) . In some seasons there is an excess amount of these fruits produced. These excess fruits are often preserved or otherwise made use of in the form of alcohol, pickles, dried fruits and fruit juice. These alcohol are also serves in a different rituals of Newari culture.\nDahi (yogurt) and curried meat (masu) or fish (machha) are served as side dishes when available. Chicken (kukhura) and fish are usually acceptable to all including the Khas Brahmin (Bahun) caste. Observant Hindus never eat beef (gai ko masu). They also eschew buffalo and yak meat as being too cow-like. Domestic pork (sungur ko masu) was traditionally only eaten by aadibasi, however wild boar (bangur ko masu) was traditionally hunted and eaten by magars. A strain derived from wild boar is now raised in captivity and used for meat that is increasingly popular with Pahari ethnicities and castes that did not traditionally eat pork. They however eat wild boar (bandel) as it is considered clean due to its forest habitat though they do not eat pork meat.\n\n### Himalayan cuisine\n\n\n### Newa: Cuisine / नेवा: नसा\nNewars are an urbanized ethnic group originally living in the Kathmandu Valley, but now also in bazaar towns elsewhere in the world and Middle Hills. In the fertile Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys, local market farmers find growing produce more profitable than grain, especially now that cheap rice and other staples can be trucked in. Furthermore, Newar households have relatively high incomes and their culture emphasizes food and feasting.\nAlthough daily Newar food practices consist mostly of components from the generic hill cuisine, during ritual, ceremonial and festive eating, Newar dishes can be much more varied than the generic Pahade/Pahari ones. Newari cuisine widely uses buffalo meat. For vegetarians, meat and dried fish can be replaced by fried tofu or cottage cheese. The cuisine has a wide range of fermented preparations, whereas Pahade/Pahari cuisine has beyond a few aachar condiments.\nKwāti (क्वाति soup of different beans), kachilā (कचिला spiced minced meat), chhoylā (छोयला water buffalo meat marinated in spices and grilled over the flames of dried wheat stalks), pukālā (पुकाला fried meat), wo (व: lentil cake), paun kwā (पाउँक्वा sour soup), swan pukā (स्वँपुका stuffed lungs), syen (स्येँ fried liver), mye (म्ये boiled and fried tongue), sapu mhichā (सःपू म्हिचा leaf tripe stuffed with bone marrow) and sanyā khunā (सन्या खुना jellied fish soup) are some of the popular festival foods.\nDessert consists of dhau (धौ yogurt), sisābusā (सिसाबुसा fruits) and mari (मरि sweets). There are achaars made with aamli fruit. Thwon (थ्वँ rice beer) and aylā (अयला local alcohol) are the common alcoholic liquors that Newars make at home.\nFood is of great importance in Newari culture. Newari cuisine is one of the most delicious food with intense flavorings. There are dishes for every edible part of buffalo meat (cooked and uncooked) that includes intestine, stomach and brain. That's another reason why they are famous.\n\n### Lohorung cuisine\nLohorung are indigenous to eastern Nepal. They have a variety of food in their cuisine made from local ingredients. Some of them are Wachipa, Wamik, Masikdaam, Sibring, Sel roti, Bawari, Dhule Achar, Saruwa, Chamre, Dibu, and so on.\n\n### Limbu cuisine\nThe Limbu have unique ethnic foods including  kinema (fermented soybeans), yangben (Reindeer Moss), bamboo shoot preparations, millet- or buckwheat-based bread, and Limbu Tongba (a traditional millet beer). Pork, chicken  is eaten in some Eastern regions like Dharan.\n\n### Madhesi cuisine\nFood in the Madhesh Province south of Sivalik Hills refers to mirror cuisines such as Maithili cuisine in the east, Tharu cuisine in the west, and Bhojpuri cuisine in the center and near west of Madhesh province. Further west, there is Mughlai-influenced Awadhi cuisine—particularly eaten by the substantial Muslim population around Nepalganj bordering Madhesh region.\nMadhesi diets can be more varied than in the Middle Hills because of greater variety of crops grown locally plus cash crops imported from cooler microclimates in nearby hill regions, as well as from other parts of Greater Nepal. Fruit commonly grown in the Madhesh include mango (aap), litchi, papaya (armewa/mewa), banana (kera/kela/kola) and jackfruit (katahar/katahal).\nA typical Madhesi food set includes basmati rice with ghee (gheu), pigeon pea daal, tarkari (cooked variety of vegetable), tarua (battered raw vegetables known as taruwa/baruwa such as potato, brinjal/aubergine, chili, cauliflower etc. deep fried in the oil), papad/papadum, mango/lemon pickles and yogurt. For non-vegetable items, they consume mostly fish or goat curry. Traditionally there never used to be poultry items but nowadays, due to urbanization, poultry items are common, too.\n\n### Tharu cuisine\nNepal has seven low elevation Inner Terai valleys enclosed by the Sivalik and Mahabharat ranges. Historically these valleys were extremely malarial and populated mainly by the Tharu who had genetic resistance. Since the valleys were isolated from one another, Tharu enclaves spoke different dialects and had different customs. They may have had different cuisines, although this has not been very well studied. Nevertheless, most Tharu historically obtained a varied diet through hunting and gathering as well as shifting agriculture and animal husbandry.\n\nThis contrasted with diets of Pahade/Pahari Hindus that were predominantly agricultural and used only a few sources of animal protein because of religious or caste prohibitions. In the 1950s, when Nepal opened its borders to foreigners and foreign aid missions, malaria suppression programs in the Inner Madhesh made it possible for people without genetic resistance to survive there. The Tharu faced an influx of people fleeing land and food deficits in the hills. Conversion of forest and grassland to cropland and prohibitions on hunting shifted the Tharu in the east and west away from land-based hunting and gathering, toward greater use of fish, freshwater crab, prawns and snails from rivers and ponds.\nTharu raise chickens and are reported to employ dogs to hunt rats in rice paddies and then roast them whole on sticks. Mutton may be obtained from nomadic hill people such as Kham Magar who take herds of sheep and goats up to sub-alpine pastures bordering the high Himalaya in summer, and down to Inner Madhesh valleys in winter. Increasing competition for land forces the Tharu people away from shifting cultivation toward sedentary agriculture, so the national custom of eating rice with lentils gains headway. The Tharu have unique ways of preparing these staples, such as rice and lentil dumplings called bagiya or dhikri and immature rice is used to make a kind of gruel, maar.\nTaro root is an important crop in the region. The leaves and roots are eaten. Sidhara is a mixture of taro root, dried fish and turmeric that is formed into cakes and dried for preservation. The cakes are broken up and cooked with radish, chili, garlic and other spices to accompany boiled rice. Snails are cleansed, boiled and spiced to make ghonghi. Another short compendium of Tharu recipes includes roasted crab, wheat flatbread fried in mustard oil, and fried taro leaf cakes.\n\n### Sweets\nNepal produces a variety of fruits (persimmons, apples, mangoes, tangerines, kiwis) and nuts that are featured in locally prepared sweets. Dessert is not a well-established concept in the Nepali cuisine and sweets made with milk, yogurt and cheese are often eaten for breakfast as standalone meals. Sometimes grated carrots are used instead of flour, or semolina, rice, corn or puffed lotus seeds. Barfi is made with some combination of lentils, fruits, flour and thickened milk.\n\nHalwa is a sweetened semolina pudding with green cardamom, cashews, raisins and shredded coconut. Like other Nepali sweets, Nepali puddings are prepared using ghee. Dumplings called lal mohan are deep fried like fritters and soaked in cardamom-flavored sweet syrup.\nAt the festival of Yomari Purnima celebrated in December, to thank the goddess of grains Annapurna after the harvest, the Newar make sweet dumplings (yomari) with rice flour filled with sesame seeds, and brown sugar or molasses. In the predominately Hindu country, sweet peda made with thickened milk (khuwaa) are offered to the Hindu gods.\n\n### Snacks\nSnacks include maize popped or parched called khaja (literally \"eat and run\"); beaten rice (baji or chiura), dry-roasted soybeans (bhatmas, Nepali: भटमास), dried fruit candy (lapsi), and South Asian foods like the samosa and South Asian sweets. International snacks like biscuits (packaged cookies), potato chips and wai wai (Nepali: वाइ वाइ, instant noodles) are all coming into widespread use. Whereas, some youths in Nepal prefer western snacks as they are easy to get and less time-consuming.\n\n### Drinks\nTea (chiya) usually taken with milk and sugar, juice of sugarcane (sarbat), and buttermilk (mahi) are common non-alcoholic drinks. Alcoholic drinks include raksi, spirits made in rustic distilleries, and jaand/jard, homemade beer made from rice. At higher elevations there is millet beer Tongba, nigaar and chhyaang.\n\n### Pickles\n\n\n## Western influence\nWestern culture has influence in Nepali/Nepali cuisine. Western food like bread, cereals, bagels, pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, and pasta and drinks like Coke, Fanta, and Sprite are common in cities and places where there are a reasonable number of tourists. Middle-class families residing in cities consume these foods on a daily basis. One can find them in almost all the restaurants around cities.\n\n## Etiquette\nAlthough most homes and restaurants in cities have dining tables, meals in villages are often eaten seated on a tiny wooden seat (pira) or on chairs or benches. A large mound of bhat, dhindo or a pile of rotis is served on a jharke thal (a large brass plate) or a khande thal (a compartment plate). On the jharke thal, the rice is surrounded by smaller mounds of prepared vegetables, fresh chutney or preserved pickles, and sometimes curd/yogurt, fish or meat. Separate glasses and bowls are instead used for different dishes, while serving on smaller plates or when serving to honoured guest or elders of the family. The most notable of this is the separate thals and bowls that are given to elders and honoured guests that are made of a separate metal alloy (jharke). Although it is vague on the specifics to what jharke can be quantified to be due to the change in the actual metallic composition of jharke for the past few generations and there being no one standard. Thus, jharke thals, bowls etc. can all vary in appearance from locality, era, craftsmanship, and more, however the sentiment still remains.  On a khande thal, there are separate small compartments for chutney and tarkari and other dishes.\nFood is traditionally eaten with the right hand. Touching or eating food with the left hand, which is traditionally used for washing off after stool, is considered unhygienic, and taboo. The hands should be washed before eating, and the hand and mouth should be rinsed after. It is customary to wash one's lips after eating. The use of spoons, and more recently forks, is also increasing, and inquiring if one is available is acceptable. The washing of hands and mouth is not necessary, before or after, when eating with a spoon.\nIn Nepal, especially among the Brahmin and Chhetri castes, the purity of food and drinks is taken very seriously. Contact with saliva is almost universally considered to make food impure, which is considered to be jutho and may be seen as a sign of insult or grave ignorance. Acceptability of jutho food follows the traditional hierarchy of respect, where parents' jutho is acceptable to children but not vice-versa and so on. People of equal standing, like friends and spouses may also share jutho, except among highly religious (where jutho is impure) or traditional people (where jutho is thought to transfer diseases, or husbands may be held superior to wives). In a similar vein, food touched by pets and other animals, or where an insect drops, are discarded and the containers thoroughly washed. Some exceptions may be made for animals traditionally thought pure, such as cows.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nLöwdin, Per (2002) [1986]. \"Food, Ritual and Society: A Study of Social Structure and Food Symbolism among the Newars\".

    "text": "# New Zealand cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of New Zealand has historical influences from British cuisine and Māori culture. As an island nation with a primarily agricultural economy, New Zealand yields produce from land and sea. \nSimilar to the cuisine of Australia, the cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine, with Mediterranean and Pacific Rim influences as the country has become more cosmopolitan. Since the 1970s, new culinary influences such as New American, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and South Asian food have become popular.\n\n## Māori cuisine\nWhen the Māori arrived in New Zealand from tropical Polynesia, they brought a number of food plants, including kūmara, taro, uwhi (ube, purple yam), hue and tī-pore, most of which grew well only in the north of the North Island. Kūmara could be grown as far south as the northern South Island, and became a staple food as it could be stored over the winter. Native New Zealand plants such as fernroot became a more important part of the diet, along with insects such as the huhu grub. Earthworms, called noke, are a part of the traditional Māori diet as well. Problems with horticulture were made up for by an abundance of bird and marine life. The large, flightless moa was soon hunted to extinction for food and tools as well. Rāhui, or resource restrictions, included forbidding the hunting of certain species in particular places or at certain times of year to allow populations to be maintained. Seafood consumed included kōura or freshwater crayfish, pāua or abalone, and tio or bluff oysters. The discovery of Typha orientalis led to the creation of a gritty unleavened bread made laboriously from its dried pollen called pungapunga.\n\nSimilar to other Polynesian people, Māori cooked food in earth ovens, known in New Zealand as hāngī, although the word umu is also used. Stones are heated by fire and food packed in leaves placed on top. These packs are then covered with foliage, cloth, or wet sacks, and then a layer of earth. Other cooking methods included roasting, stone-boiling, or steaming using geothermal heated water, and cooking over an open fire.\nSome foods were preserved using smoke, air-drying, fermentation, or layers of fat—particularly muttonbirds.\nMāori were one of the few people to have no form of alcoholic beverage.\n\n### Food and religion\nIn traditional Māori religion food was noa, or non-sacred. This meant care had to be taken to prevent it from coming into contact with tapu places or objects. If it did, the tapu of the place or object, and often the people associated with it, would be at risk. High chiefs, and people engaged in tapu work such as tattooing, were tapu and were restricted in how they could deal with food, with the most tapu needing to be fed by others. One story tells of a war party which had to be postponed as no non-tapu people were available to load the food supplies into the party's waka.\n\n### European influences\nWhen Europeans (Pākehā) first arrived in New Zealand from the late eighteenth century, they brought their own foods with them. Some of these, especially pork and potatoes, were quickly adopted by Māori. Potatoes were particularly popular as they were grown in a similar way to kūmara but produced a much higher yield with less effort. Other European foods such as wheat, pumpkin, mutton, sugar, and many types of fruit also became a part of the Māori diet and were widely traded with visiting ships. American sailors brought new varieties of kūmara to New Zealand, and these high-yield varieties quickly superseded the original varieties of kūmara. (Today, most kūmara are the commercial varieties: Owairaka Red, Toka Toka Gold and Beauregard.) The introduction of maize (kōpakipaki or kānga) led to the creation of a meal called kōpiro which involves submerging corn cobs under running water to ferment before its kernels are scraped off and formed into cakes to roast or steam. A coffee and spice merchant of European descent, David Strang, invented instant coffee in Invercargill in 1890. The drink quickly spread around New Zealand and then around the world.\nAlcohol, initially rejected as waipiro (stinking water), also became acceptable in Māori life. Most Māori tribes grew surpluses of food for trade with other tribes and with European visitors and settlers. Some tribes grew wealthy from this trade, although the Māori food industry declined in the mid-nineteenth century because of land loss and competition from settler farmers. Many traditional food sources, such as the kererū (wood pigeon) and other birds, as well as some types of fish and plants, became scarce as forests were destroyed and species were over-hunted.\n\n### Māori cuisine today\nPresent-day Māori cuisine is a mixture of Māori tradition, old-fashioned English cookery, and contemporary dishes. Some Māori names for consumables, like pāua (also prized for its shell), have entered common New Zealand English usage.\nMost large Māori gatherings feature a hāngī, which is likely to contain foods brought to New Zealand by Māori and by pākehā. In recent decades, there has been much concern that Māori are disproportionately likely to suffer from obesity, heart disease, and diabetes as a result of eating habits.\nTwo dishes regarded as distinctively Māori are the boil-up—made of pork, potatoes, kūmara, and dumplings—and pork and pūhā (sow thistle), which combine introduced and indigenous foods. Both dishes owe much to nineteenth-century British cooking methods.\nAnother distinctive food is rēwena or \"Māori bread\", which is made with fermented potatoes. The 2020 cookbook Hiakai by chef Monique Fiso, academic Tracy Berno and food writer Lucy Corry describes the history, development and tikanga of modern Māori food.\nA dish served during Matariki feasts or at hākari (feasts) on the marae is parāoa parai (fry bread). They are described as crispy and golden brown on the outside and fluffy on the inside.\n\n## New Zealand European cuisine\nThe majority of New Zealanders are Pākehā of British descent, so British cuisine has been very influential.\n\n### British Isles settler food\nNineteenth-century British settlers in New Zealand tried as much as possible to reproduce the foods of their homeland. In the early stages of colonisation this was difficult as many ingredients were unavailable. They ate native birds and fish, and used local ingredients in substitution for those which were unavailable, for example brewing tea and beer using unconventional plants. Most of these innovations were abandoned as the New Zealand British population increased and conventional ingredients began to be mass-imported or produced in New Zealand. One innovation which was commonly served on New Zealand tables until the mid-1980s was colonial goose, a stuffed leg of lamb which substituted for goose. A major difference between British and New Zealand British food was that meat was much more readily available to all social classes in New Zealand. Whereas in nineteenth-century Britain, labourers ate meat in very small quantities, in New Zealand they could have it for every meal. Since meat was a high-status food in Britain, British settlers in New Zealand ate vast quantities of it. Dishes such as fish and chips and meat pies remain popular in both the United Kingdom and New Zealand.\nLike the British, New Zealand British have traditionally preferred sweet foods, and a wealth of baking dishes celebrate important occasions, reflected through cakes, scones, muffins and other mainly sweet baking dishes. The country's most iconic recipe book, the Edmonds Cookery Book, originally began as publicity material for a baking powder company, and contains a high proportion of baking recipes.\n\n### From Antipodean British fare to Asia-Pacific fusion\nFor most of the twentieth century, New Zealand cuisine remained highly derivative of British food. Unlike Britain, New Zealand escaped major food shortages during World War II. However, demands of the US forces in the Pacific as well as exports to Britain saw meat and butter rationed between 1943 and 1950.  From about the 1960s, the advent of affordable air travel allowed New Zealanders to travel overseas more easily. Many New Zealanders went to Europe on overseas experience where they encountered French and Italian cooking, and also the Indian and Chinese restaurants of Britain as well as the New British cuisine. When they returned home they helped create a demand for better-quality food and more variety. They also tried to discover what New Zealand cuisine was, experimenting with hāngī and gaining a greater appreciation of New Zealand produce.\nThe United Kingdom's joining of the European Economic Community (EEC) (now the European Union) in 1973 sounded the death knell of New Zealand's identity as an agricultural producer for the British Isles, and the formal cultural ties, including cuisine, with the United Kingdom started to become diluted.  During this period, certain non-British or Irish European dishes, such as beef bourguignon, had shed the 'ethnic' connotation and entered mainstream New Zealand cooking. The 1970s also saw major changes in take-away food with the arrival of the first American fast-food chains: Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in 1971, Pizza Hut in 1974, and McDonald's in 1976.\nThe 1980s was marked with economic liberalisation dubbed Rogernomics (named for the then-Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas) that abolished farm subsidies, forcing many farmers to find alternative means of survival. Many chose to produce specialty cheese types like Havarti, Brie and Stilton, or diversified into growing olives or grapes instead of traditional meat and dairy farming. Avocado oil for cooking was commercialised in New Zealand in 1999 by a group of growers based in the Tauranga region.\nRogernomics also abolished most import tariffs and instituted a more relaxed agricultural product import quarantine regime. This allowed hitherto prohibited or prohibitively expensive specialty foods, such as genuine serrano ham from Spain, extra virgin olive oil from Italy, and mango from Thailand, to be available in New Zealand at reasonable costs. These two developments from Rogernomics have given birth to a proliferation of specialist food products available in New Zealand.\nOn top of changes in available ingredients, the 1980s also witnessed a wholescale liberalisation in attitude towards the formerly 'foreign muck' cooking styles and segmentation of lifestyles according to income and socio-economic status. New Zealand had by this time developed a largely distinct cultural outlook away from the British Isles, and this also made foreign cooking styles more acceptable among the general public. The same era also saw the moneyed populations feeling free to openly emulate the luxurious eating and drinking habits of upper and upper middle classes overseas, as the traditional New Zealand preference of egalitarianism, manifested in widespread prejudice against any deviation from lower-middle-class lifestyles, waned in influence. In the words of New Zealand-based anthropologist David Veart, this period of sea change in New Zealand's culinary culture was akin to \"being let out after a long school detention\".\n\n## Other cuisines in New Zealand\nPeople from many different backgrounds have settled in New Zealand, and many have tried to reproduce their native cuisines or national dishes in New Zealand. Similar to early Pākehā settlers, this often proved difficult. Larger ethnic groups, such as the Chinese, were able to import some ingredients, but often dishes had to be modified to use local ingredients. Ethnic restaurants have served as community meeting places and have also given other New Zealanders a chance to try different cuisines. However, for most of its history there were few ethnic restaurants in New Zealand other than inauthentic Chinese, Indian and Italian eateries.\nThe Immigration Act 1986 completely abolished nationality preference for immigration, and immigration from East Asia, Southeast Asia and South Asia has greatly increased since. Many of these immigrants have brought their  cuisines to New Zealand, and often opened ethnic restaurants and takeaway eateries, giving New Zealanders a chance to try more authentic editions of Japanese, Thai, Malay, regional Chinese, Indian, and other Asian cuisines. Over time these ethnic cuisines have been gradually accepted by Pākehā and Māori New Zealanders. Consequently, most New Zealand cities have a wide variety of ethnic restaurants, and foods such as kebabs, couscous, and sushi are served virtually everywhere. Many ethnic origin dishes have been willingly adopted by New Zealanders as their own, including sushi, antipasto, butter chicken, pad thai, pasta, such that they appear in home cooking, as well as in generic New Zealand restaurants.\nIngredients for many ethnic dishes have become much easier to find in major cities, mostly through speciality or ethnic food stores started by many of the post-1987 migrants to New Zealand, but in some cases also through mainstream New Zealand supermarket chains. Similar to Australia, in time the increasing availability of ingredients gave birth to a more authentic style of ethnic cooking, and some ethnic ingredients have been adopted for local cooking: ingredients such as extra virgin olive oil and sun-dried tomatoes, and to a lesser extent fish sauce and rice paper wrappers were already seen as ordinary ingredients by 2000, whereas even by the late 1980s many people would still have regarded them as exotic.\n\n## Contemporary cuisine\nAs a result of various developments, the cuisine of New Zealand in the 21st century is in a state of flux: cosmopolitan Pacific Rim fare's reign is now the norm in much of metropolitan eating-out scenes, and traditional hearty settlers' food, now dubbed 'Kwisine Kiwiana',  but reinterpreted through Pacific Rim cooking knowledge, is a popular cooking style for eating-out scenes even in the most remote rural regions. Most of the home cooking prepared at households in Auckland is now a mix of traditional Kiwiana dishes heavily modified by Mediterranean and Asian techniques and ingredients, and adapted versions of Mediterranean, Chinese, and Indian dishes.  In the more culturally traditional parts of the country, such as rural Canterbury and the West Coast, however, traditional Kiwiana fare is still the norm at many homes. \nCertain vestiges of traditional Kiwiana dishes remain popular throughout the country, such as fish and chips, meat pies, custard squares, pavlova, and others. An active nostalgia movement supports the traditional Kiwiana cuisine, as spearheaded by the popularity of the television series Kiwi Kitchen presented by Richard Till, which is believed to be a public response to a common perception that the traditional Kiwiana dishes are disappearing from the New Zealand tables. Home baking is particularly believed to be the last bastion of New Zealand cuisine still unaffected by international trends. \nConcurrently, food habits are changing in Australia to lighter fares influenced by the Mediterranean, and subsequently Southeast Asian, styles of cooking. The proximity, common history, and strong modern political, economic, cultural, and family ties between the two countries means many New Zealand diners and chefs have always been well informed of the trends in the Australian dining scene.  Many chefs had worked in Australia and endeavour to learn from their trans-Tasman counterparts, and in time the changing Australian culinary scene has trickle-down effects on the New Zealand cuisine as well.\nIn general, there are minimal differences between the food preference of New Zealand and Australia. The food trends in New Zealand tend to trail its trans-Tasman counterparts by a few years to a decade, such as Mediterranean cookery, which did not become mainstream in New Zealand until the dawn of the 1990s, while its influence was already felt in Australia by the 1980s. While Australia has by the early 21st century developed a well-established niche specialist produce distributing channel, a similar system is still in its infancy across the Tasman.  However, in recent times Auckland and Wellington have food fashions moving essentially in sync with that of Sydney and Melbourne.\nOne major recent development in the food scene is the emergence of a genuine café culture and disappearance of the traditional institution of tearooms at large. Before the 1990s, tearooms proliferated throughout the country offering cream tea, cakes, cucumber sandwiches, and pastries such as custard squares, with filtered coffee or tea as drinks. New Zealanders have copied the Mediterranean practise of drinking espresso-based coffees, but also invented instant coffee, which is now widely consumed around the world. In time, cafes became popular and many tearoom owners converted their businesses to cafes. Cream tea has gone out of fashion in the contemporary New Zealand dining scene, and scones are baked at homes rather than served in eateries. \n\nVegetarianism had been regarded as an alternative lifestyle for many years, but became more mainstream during the 1980s. However, despite exhortations by the Ministry of Health and their allies for people to eat less meat, and more cereals, fruits, and vegetables, a highly meat-based diet remains a part of New Zealand culture, albeit with a decrease in red meat consumption, and intake of fish and chicken has been on the rise due to their relative affordability compared to red meat. Annual meat consumption was 75.2 kg (166 lb) per capita in 2019, comprising 41.1 kg (91 lb) of chicken and other poultry, 18.9 kg (42 lb) of pork, ham and bacon, 11.6 kg (26 lb) of beef and veal, and 3.6 kg (7.9 lb) of lamb and mutton.\n\n## New Zealand cuisine in other countries\nGlobally, New Zealand cuisine has little effect, although Australia does feel influences from New Zealand cuisine. The country's well known culinary export, the pavlova, has been the object of a decades-long battle with Australia over where it was invented.\nFusion cuisine and foreign cuisine styles interact with modern New Zealand cuisine, with chefs from New Zealand actively learning overseas trends, and chefs like Peter Gordon, bakers such as Dean Brettschneider, and foodies such as Lauraine Jacobs influencing fusion cuisines derived from New Zealand cuisine. Cuisine magazine, first published in 1986, has earned global fame and is held in high prestige among the worldwide foodie communities.\n\n## Alcoholic beverages\nNew Zealand has a successful wine industry, with about 76 million litres being exported in the year to June 2007. The first vines are thought to have been introduced by missionary Samuel Marsden, and planted in 1817 by Charles Gordon, superintendent of agriculture for the missionaries, according to Dr Richard Smart who was viticultural editor of both editions of The Oxford Companion to Wine. Official British resident James Busby is credited with producing wine at Kerikeri in 1833, and Charles Darwin noted the winery in his diary when he visited Kerikeri in 1835.\nSmall vineyards were also planted by French settlers in Akaroa in the 1840s. However, wine was drunk in relatively small quantities well into the twentieth century, with the average per capita consumption only about 2.6 litres in 1966. The high price of imported wines probably prevented New Zealanders from developing a taste for wine, although it did help sales of local vintages. The quality of these wines slowly improved, with New Zealand wines winning three gold and 13 silver medals at the International Wine Fair in 1963. Aided by the deregulation of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s, domestic wine consumption increased and New Zealand wine won increasing accolades internationally.\nThere are 10 major wine-producing areas in New Zealand, with Marlborough famed for its sauvignon blanc, Gisborne for its chardonnay, and Central Otago and Martinborough known for pinot noir and pinot gris. Hawkes Bay is known for its bold cabernets, and Auckland's Waiheke Island is home to one of the top 20 cabernet blends in the world. Marlborough and Hawkes Bay are New Zealand's two premium wine-growing regions.\nBeer is the most popular alcoholic drink in New Zealand, accounting for 63% of available alcohol for sale. New Zealand is ranked 27th in beer consumption per capita, at around 64.7 litres per person per annum. The vast majority of beer produced in New Zealand is a type of lager, either pale or amber in colour, and between 4%–5% alcohol by volume.\nThere are also over 100 smaller craft breweries and brewpubs producing a vast range of beer styles. The two largest breweries in New Zealand, Lion Nathan and DB Breweries, control almost 90% of sales by volume between them.  New Zealand is also a leading hops-producing nation with some of the most sought-after hops in the world.\n\n## Patterns of eating\nMost New Zealanders eat their main meal—known as 'dinner' or sometimes 'tea'—in the evening. The move from midday to evening dinners began in the early 20th century, although the tradition of a midday dinner on Sunday remained well into the 1960s. In 1962, a nationwide food survey reported 75% of households normally ate their main meal in the evening, but over 50% of households ate their Sunday main meal at midday. The survey was repeated in 1982, by which time 83% of households ate their main meal in the evening, and only 21% of households ate their Sunday main meal at midday.\nIn the summer, barbecues have become popular since the late 20th century, generally as a social event. Guests will usually be invited to bring beer or wine, and on occasion meat, which the host will cook. Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. Traditionally, the men cook the meat. Many gardens are designed with special areas for barbecuing. Similar Māori gatherings will often feature a hāngī, a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top and covered with damp cloth or leaves. Water is added before the hole is quickly covered with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whānau) help out for such a feast.\nMany New Zealand gatherings feature a custom known as 'bring a plate' (potluck) in which each guest will bring a plate of food to share. This allows people to host large groups without incurring serious expense. Similar customs include guests bringing salads or meat to a barbecue. Most New Zealand parties are 'BYO' (bring your own alcohol), but in this case the drinks are not usually shared.\n\nNew Zealand's dining-out culture developed strongly in the 1960s, thanks partially to the liberalisation of liquor licensing laws (in 1961) and popularisation of cafés and other similar casual dining establishments. It is common for people to visit cafés regularly for lunch or morning or afternoon snacks.  On the other hand, eating at a restaurant is still regarded as a special occasion or treat for most of the population.\nFish and chips, the staple take-away meal in New Zealand, has been popular for decades. Since the 1970s, a larger fast food culture has developed, similar to that in the United States. Many American fast-food chains have a presence in New Zealand, and local variants (such as Burger Fuel and Hell Pizza) have arisen. The meat pie is possibly the nearest thing New Zealand has to street food, sold in dairies, bakeries, supermarkets, petrol stations, and school canteens. Pies are usually made with beef mince or steak, lamb, chicken, veggies, or pork; sweet pies are less common. A fast-food chain based on pies, Georgie Pie, was founded in 1977; however, it ran into financial trouble and went out of business in 1998, with McDonald's New Zealand buying its assets. (The chain was revived in a limited form between 2013 and 2020, with pies being sold through McDonald's restaurants.)\nIn malls, food courts have become popular, with several in Auckland alone. Immigration has led to an increase in choice and quality, with many food halls offering Asian cuisines including Thai, Indian, Turkish, Malaysian, Japanese and Chinese, as well as distinctly New Zealand fare such as roast dinners.\n\n## New Zealand foods\n\n\n### Developed in New Zealand\n\n\n### Imported foods, now significant in New Zealand\n\n\n## See also\nList of Australian and New Zealand dishes\nCategory:Restaurants in New Zealand\nAlcohol in New Zealand\nList of Oceanian cuisines\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n### Bibliography\nMathias, Peta (2005).

The British colonial period established a strong base of interest in Anglo-Celtic style recipes and methods. Later influences developed out of multicultural immigration and included Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines. Mediterranean cuisine influences from Greek cuisine, Italian cuisine, and Lebanese cuisine influences are strong, also influences from French cuisine, Indian cuisine, Spanish cuisine, and Turkish cuisine, German cuisine, and African cuisine. Regional Australian cuisines commonly use locally grown vegetables based on seasonal availability, and Australia also has large fruit-growing regions. The Granny Smith variety of apples originated in Sydney, Australia in 1868. In the Southern states of Victoria and South Australia, in particular the Barossa Valley, wines and food reflect the region's traditions and heritage. Australia's climate makes barbecues commonplace. Barbecue stalls selling sausages and fried onion on white bread with tomato or barbecue sauce are common.\n\n Australian cuisine\n New South Wales cuisine\n Northern Territory cuisine\n Queensland cuisine\n South Australian cuisine\n Tasmanian cuisine\n Victorian cuisine\n Western Australian cuisine\n Christmas Island cuisine\n Cocossian cuisine\n Norfolk Island cuisine\n\n## Melanesia\nFijian cuisine\n New Caledonian cuisine\n Papua New Guinean cuisine\n Solomon Islands cuisine\n Vanuatuan cuisine\n\n## Micronesia\nGilbertese cuisine\n Guam (Chamorro) cuisine\n Marshallese cuisine\n Micronesian cuisine\n Nauruan cuisine\n Northern Marianan cuisine\n Palauan cuisine\n\n## Polynesia\nPolynesian cuisine encompasses the culinary practices of Polynesia, an area notably defined as the Polynesian Triangle and, occasionally, the Polynesian outliers that have been settled by Polynesian seafarers. The vast area of Polynesia has had a great influence on the cuisine itself, which differs as a result of climate, geography and neighbouring island groups, such as the practice of harvesting and boiling down coconut sap in the atolls from Micronesian peoples or the harvesting and processing of sago in the outliers from Melanesians.

    "text": "# Odisha\n\nOdisha (Odia: oṛiśā, pronounced [oˈɽisa] ), spelled Orissa until 2011, is a state located in Eastern India. It is the eighth-largest state by area, and the eleventh-largest by population, with over 41 million inhabitants. The state also has the third-largest population of Scheduled Tribes in India. It neighbours the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south. Odisha has a coastline of 485 kilometres (301 mi) along the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. The region is also known as Utkaḷa and is mentioned by this name in India's national anthem, Jana Gana Mana.\nThe ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha. The modern boundaries of Odisha were demarcated by the British Indian government, the Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and Orissa Province, Madras Presidency and Central Provinces. Utkala Divas (lit. 'Odisha Day') is celebrated on 1 April. Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135, after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.\n\n## Etymology\nThe terms Odisha and Orissa (Odia: ଓଡ଼ିଶା, Oṛissa) derive from the ancient Prakrit word  \"Odda Visaya\" (also \"Udra Bibhasha\" or \"Odra Bibhasha\") as in the Tirumalai inscription of Rajendra Chola I, which is dated to 1025. Sarala Das, who translated the Mahabharata into the Odia language in the 15th century, calls the region 'Odra Rashtra' as Odisha. The inscriptions of Kapilendra Deva of the Gajapati Kingdom (1435–67) on the walls of temples in Puri call the region Odisha or Odisha Rajya.\nIn 2011, the English rendering of ଓଡ଼ିଶା was changed from \"Orissa\" to \"Odisha\", and the name of its language from \"Oriya\" to \"Odia\", by the passage of the Orissa (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2010 and the Constitution (113th Amendment) Bill, 2010 in the Parliament. The Hindi rendering उड़ीसा (uṛīsā) was also modified to ओड़िशा (or̥iśā). After a brief debate, the lower house, Lok Sabha, passed the bill and amendment on 9 November 2010. On 24 March 2011, Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, also passed the bill and the amendment. The changes in spelling were made with the intention of having the English and Hindi renditions conform to the Odia transliteration. However, the underlying Odia texts were nevertheless transliterated incorrectly as per the Hunterian system, the official national transliteration standard, in which the transliterations would be Orisha and Oria instead.\n\n## History\nPrehistoric Acheulian tools dating to Lower Paleolithic era have been discovered in various places in the region, implying an early settlement by humans. Kalinga has been mentioned in ancient texts like Mahabharata, Vayu Purana and Mahagovinda Suttanta.\nAccording to political scientist Sudama Misra, the Kalinga janapada originally comprised the area covered by the Puri and Ganjam districts. The Sabar people of Odisha have also been mentioned in the Mahabharata. Baudhayana mentions Kalinga as not yet being influenced by Vedic traditions, implying it followed mostly tribal traditions.\n\nAshoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered Kalinga in the bloody Kalinga War in 261 BCE, which was the eighth year of his reign. According to his own edicts, in that war about 100,000 people were killed, 150,000 were captured and more were affected. The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war is said to have deeply affected Ashoka. He turned into a pacifist and converted to Buddhism.\nBy c. 150 BCE, Emperor Kharavela, who was possibly a contemporary of Demetrius I of Bactria, conquered a major part of the Indian sub-continent. Kharavela was a Jain ruler. He also built the monastery atop the Udayagiri hill. Subsequently, the region was ruled by monarchs, such as Samudragupta and Shashanka. It was also a part of Harsha's empire.\nThe city of Brahmapur in Odisha is also known to have been the capital of the Pauravas during the closing years of 4th century CE. Nothing was heard from the Pauravas from about the 3rd century CE, because they were annexed by the Yaudheya Republic, who in turn submitted to the Mauryans. It was only at the end of 4th century CE, that they established royalty at Brahmapur, after about 700 years.\nLater, the kings of the Somavamsi dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar. They were replaced by the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Notable rulers of the dynasty were Anantavarman Chodaganga, who began reconstruction on the present-day Shri Jagannath Temple in Puri (c. 1135), and Narasimhadeva I, who constructed the Konark temple (c. 1250).\nThe Eastern Ganga Dynasty was followed by the Gajapati Kingdom.  The region resisted integration into the Mughal Empire until 1568, when it was conquered by Sultanate of Bengal. Mukunda Deva, who is considered the last independent king of Kalinga, was defeated and was killed in battle by a rebel Ramachandra Bhanja. Ramachandra Bhanja himself was killed by Bayazid Khan Karrani. In 1591, Man Singh I, then governor of Bihar, led an army to take Odisha from the Karranis of Bengal. They agreed to treaty because their leader Qutlu Khan Lohani had recently died. But they then broke the treaty by attacking the temple town of Puri. Man Singh returned in 1592 and pacified the region.\nIn 1751, the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan ceded the region to the Maratha Empire.\nThe British had occupied the Northern Circars, comprising the southern coast of Odisha, as a result of the Second Carnatic War by 1760, and incorporated them into the Madras Presidency gradually. In 1803, the British ousted the Marathas from the Puri-Cuttack region of Odisha during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The northern and western districts of Odisha were incorporated into the Bengal Presidency.\nThe Orissa famine of 1866 caused an estimated 1 million deaths. Following this, large-scale irrigation projects were undertaken.  In 1903, the Utkal Sammilani organisation was founded to demand the unification of Odia-speaking regions into one state. On 1 April 1912, the Bihar and Orissa Province was formed. On 1 April 1936, Bihar and Orissa were split into separate provinces. The new province of Orissa came into existence on a linguistic basis during the British rule in India, with Sir John Austen Hubback as the first governor. Following India's independence, on 15 August 1947, 27 princely states signed the document to join Orissa. Most of the Orissa Tributary States, a group of princely states, acceded to Orissa in 1948, after the collapse of the Eastern States Union.\n\n## Geography\nOdisha lies between the latitudes 17.780N and 22.730N, and between longitudes 81.37E and 87.53E. The state has an area of 155,707 km2, which is 4.87% of total area of India, and a coastline of 450 km. In the eastern part of the state lies the coastal plain. It extends from the Subarnarekha River in the north to the Rushikulya River in the south. The lake Chilika is part of the coastal plains. The plains are rich in fertile silt deposited by the six major rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal: Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, Baitarani, Brahmani, Mahanadi, and Rushikulya. The National Rice Research Institute (NRRI), a Food and Agriculture Organization-recognised rice gene bank and research institute, is situated on the banks of Mahanadi in Cuttack. The stretch between Puri and Bhadrak in Odisha juts out a little into the sea, making it vulnerable to any cyclonic activity.\n\nThree-quarters of the state is covered in mountain ranges. Deep and broad valleys have been made in them by rivers. These valleys have fertile soil and are densely populated. Odisha also has plateaus and rolling uplands, which have lower elevation than the plateaus. The highest point in the state is Deomali at 1,672 metres in Koraput district. Some other high peaks are: Sinkaram (1,620 m), Golikoda (1,617 m), and Yendrika (1,582 metres).\n\n### Climate\nThe state experiences four meteorological seasons: winter (January to February), pre-monsoon season (March to May), south-west monsoon season (June to September) and north east monsoon season (October–December). However, locally the year is divided into six traditional seasons (or rutus):  Grishma (summer), Barsha (rainy season), Sharata (autumn), Hemanta (dewy),Sheeta(winter season) and Basanta (spring).\n\n### Biodiversity\nAccording to a Forest Survey of India report released in 2012, Odisha has 48,903 km2 of wild forest, covering 31.41% of the state's total area. The forests are classified into areas of dense forest (7,060 km2), medium dense forest (21,366 km2), open forest (forest without closed canopy; 20,477 km2) and scrub forest or scrubland (4,734 km2). The state also has bamboo forests (10,518 km2) and tidal areas of mangrove swamp (221 km2). The state is gradually losing its wilderness areas to timber smuggling, deforestation, destructive mining, and general urban industrialisation, as well as livestock grazing. There have been attempts at conservation and reforestation.\nDue to the climate and good rainfall, Odisha's evergreen and moist forests are uniquely suitable habitats for wild orchids. Around 130 species have been reported from the state. Around 97 of them are found in Mayurbhanj district alone. The Orchid House of the Nandankanan Zoological Park maintains some of these species.\nSimlipal National Park is a protected wildlife area and Bengal tiger reserve spread over 2,750 km2 of the northern part of Mayurbhanj district. The park has around 1,078 species of plants, including 94 of the aforementioned orchids. The sal is the primary tree species. For fauna, the park is home to around 55 species of mammal, including the Bengal tiger, chital, chousingha, common langur, gaur, Indian elephant, Indian giant squirrel, jungle cat, leopard, muntjac, sambar, small Indian civet and wild boar. There are over 300 species of birds in the park, such as the common hill myna, as well as grey, Indian pied and Malabar pied hornbills. There are also some 60 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the famed king cobra, plus banded krait and tricarinate hill turtle. There is also a mugger crocodile breeding programme in nearby Ramtirtha.\nThe Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary is a 190 km2 protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests, driving the herds of elephants to migrate away, as well as increasing human-elephant conflicts—which sometimes results in injury and death (on both sides). Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration after being accidentally electrocuted by power lines or even hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by ivory poachers. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants, but by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara Reserve forest, Chilika, Nayagarh district, and Athagad. Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has leopards, jungle cats and herds of chital.\nThe Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara district covers 650 km2, of which 150 km2 are mangroves. Gahirmatha Beach, in Bhitarkanika, is the world's largest nesting site for olive ridley sea turtles. In 2013, the Indian Coast Guard initiated Operation Oliver to protect the endangered sea turtle population of the region. Other major nesting grounds for the turtle in the state are Rushikulya, in Ganjam district, and the mouth of the Devi river. The Bhitarkanika sanctuary is also noted for its large population of saltwater crocodiles and Asian water monitors, the second-largest lizard species on earth, in addition to axis deer and rhesus macaques. The coastal mangrove environments are home to several types of mudskippers, including the barred, Boddart's blue-spotted and great blue-spotted mudskippers.\nIn winter, Bhitarkanika is also visited by migratory birds. Among the many species, both resident and migratory, are kingfishers (including black-capped, collared and common kingfishers), herons (such as black-crowned night, grey, purple and striated herons), Indian cormorants, openbill storks, Oriental white ibis, pheasant-tailed jacana, sarus cranes, spotted owlets and white-bellied sea-eagles. The possibly endangered horseshoe crab is also found in this region.\nChilika Lake is a brackish water lagoon on the east coast of Odisha with an area of 1,105 km2. It is connected to the Bay of Bengal by a 35-km-long narrow channel and is a part of the Mahanadi delta. In the dry season, the tides bring in salt water. In the rainy season, the rivers falling into the lagoon decrease its salinity. Birds from places as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal (and other parts of Russia), Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas migrate to the lagoon in winter. Among the waterfowl and wading birds spotted there are Eurasian wigeon, pintail, bar-headed goose, greylag goose, greater flamingo, common mallard and Goliath heron. The lagoon also has a small population of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins. The state's coastal region has also had sightings of the rare finless porpoise, as well as the more common bottlenose dolphin, humpback dolphin and spinner dolphins in its waters.\nSatapada is situated close to the northeast cape of Chilika Lake and Bay of Bengal. It is famous for dolphin watching in their natural habitat. There is a tiny island en route for watching dolphins, where tourists often take a short stop. Apart from that, this island is also home for tiny red crabs.\nAccording to a census conducted in 2016, there are around 2000 elephants in the state.\n\n## Government and politics\nAll states in India are governed by a parliamentary system of government based on universal adult franchise.\nThe main parties active in the politics of Odisha are the Biju Janata Dal, the Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. Currently, BJP, who won for the first time, formed the government after winning the majority in 2024 Odisha Legislative Assembly election. Mohan Charan Majhi is the 17th Chief Minister of Odisha.\n\n### Legislative assembly\nThe Odisha state has a unicameral legislature. The Odisha Legislative Assembly consists of 147 elected members, and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker, or by the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor of Odisha. The governor is appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The 147 elected representatives are called Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs. One MLA may be nominated from the Anglo-Indian community by the governor. The term of the office is for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term.\nThe judiciary is composed of the Odisha High Court, located at Cuttack, and a system of lower courts.\n\n### Subdivisions\nOdisha has been divided into 30 districts. These 30 districts have been placed under three different revenue divisions to streamline their governance. The divisions are North, Central and South, with their headquarters at Sambalpur, Cuttack and Berhampur respectively. Each division consists of ten districts and has as its administrative head a Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC). The position of the RDC in the administrative hierarchy is that between that of the district administration and the state secretariat. The RDCs report to the Board of Revenue, which is headed by a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service.\n\nEach district is administered by a Collector and district magistrate, who is appointed from the Indian Administrative Service or a very senior officer from Odisha Administrative Service. The collector and district magistrate is responsible for collecting the revenue and maintaining law and order in the district. Each district is separated into sub-divisions, each governed by a sub-collector and sub-divisional magistrate. The sub-divisions are further divided into tahasils. The tahasils are headed by tahasildar. Odisha has 58 sub-divisions, 317 tahasils and 314 blocks. Blocks consists of Panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.\nThe capital of the state is Bhubaneswar and the largest city is Cuttack, which also functions as the deputy capital of the state . The other major cities are, Rourkela, Berhampur and Sambalpur. Municipal Corporations in Odisha include Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Puri, Sambalpur and Rourkela.\nOther municipalities of Odisha include Angul, Asika, Balangir, Balasore, Barbil, Bargarh, Baripada, Basudevpur, Belpahar, Bhadrak, Bhanjanagar, Bhawanipatna, Biramitrapur, Boudh, Brajarajnagar, Byasanagar, Chhatrapur, Deogarh, Dhamra, Dhenkanal, Gopalpur, Gunupur, Hinjilicut, Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Jeypore, Jharsuguda, Joda, Kendrapara, Kendujhar, Khordha, Konark, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Nayagarh, Nuapada, Paradeep, Paralakhemundi, Phulbani, Rajgangpur, Rayagada, Sonepur, Sundargarh, Talcher, Titilagarh, Karanjia, Chatrapur, Asika, Kantabanji, Nimapada, Baudhgarh, and Umerkote.\n\nAuxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs in rural areas.\n\n## Economy\n\n\n### Macro-economic trend\nOdisha is experiencing a rapid economic growth post-Covid. The impressive growth in gross domestic product of the state has been reported by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Odisha's growth rate is above the national average. The central Government's Urban Development Ministry has recently announced the names of 20 cities selected to be developed as smart cities. The state capital Bhubaneswar is the first city in the list of smart Cities released in January 2016, a pet project of the Indian Government. The announcement also marked with sanction of Rs 508.02 billion over the five years for development.\n\n### Industrial development\nOdisha has abundant natural resources and a large coastline. Odisha has emerged as the most preferred destination for overseas investors with investment proposals. It contains a fifth of India's coal, a quarter of its iron ore, a third of its bauxite reserves and most of the chromite.\nRourkela Steel Plant was the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, built with collaboration of Germany.\nArcelor-Mittal has also announced plans to invest in another mega steel project amounting to $10 billion. Russian major Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Company (MMK) plans to set up a 10 MT steel plant in Odisha, too. Nippon Steel Corporation has recently announced to set up their own plants, one of which will be the world's largest and most advanced steel plant in Odisha, with a production capacity of 30 MT annually.  Bandhabahal is a major area of open cast coal mines in Odisha. The state is attracting an unprecedented amount of investment in aluminium, coal-based power plants, petrochemicals, and information technology as well. In power generation, Reliance Power (Anil Ambani Group) is putting up the world's largest power plant with an investment of US$13 billion at Hirma in Jharsuguda district.\nIn 2009 Odisha was the second top domestic investment destination with Gujarat first and Andhra Pradesh in third place according to an analysis of ASSOCHAM Investment Meter (AIM) study on corporate investments. Odisha's share was 12.6 per cent in total investment in the country. It received an investment proposal worth ₹2.01 trillion (equivalent to ₹4.5 trillion or US$53 billion in 2023) in 2010. Steel and power were among the sectors which attracted maximum investments in the state.\nThe recently concluded Make in Odisha Conclave 2022 saw the state generate investment proposals worth ₹10.5 trillion with an employment potential for 10,37,701 people. Out of the total investment proposals received, the metals, ancillary and downstream sectors fetched ₹5.50 lakhs crore (trillion), power, green energy, and renewable energy sector fetched ₹2.38 trillion, and chemicals-petrochemicals and logistics-infrastructure sector attracted ₹76,000 crores and ₹1.20 trillion, respectively. Odisha has the potential to become a trillion-dollar economy by 2030.\n\n### Transportation\nOdisha has a network of roads, railways, airports and seaports. Bhubaneswar is well connected by air, rail and road with the rest of India. Some highways are getting expanded to four lanes. Odisha Government Plans Mega Metro Rail Project to Connect Puri and Bhubaneswar  The metro rail proposal was given to connect trains between Puri- Bhubaneswar – Cuttack. The Odisha government has planned a new Expressway that will connect Biju Patnaik International Airport at Bhubaneswar with the proposed Shri Jagannath International Airport at Puri.\n\n### Air\nOdisha has a total of three operational airports, 16 airstrips and 16 helipads. The airport at Jharsuguda was upgraded to a full-fledged domestic airport in May 2018. Rourkela Airport became operational in December 2022.The Dhamra Port Company Limited plans to build Dhamra Airport 20 km from Dhamra Port.\n\nBhubaneswar – Biju Patnaik International Airport\nJeypore – Jeypore Airport\nJharsuguda – Veer Surendra Sai Airport\nRourkela – Rourkela Airport\nBerhampur – Rangeilunda Airport\nBhawanipatna - Utkela Airport\n\n### Seaports\nOdisha has a coastline of 485 kilometres (301 mi). It has one major port at Paradip and few minor ports. some of them are:\n\nPort of Dhamara\nPort of Gopalpur\nPort of Paradip\nPort of Subarnarekha\n\n### Railways\nMajor cities of Odisha are well connected to all the major cities of India by direct daily trains and weekly trains. Most of the railway network in Odisha lies under the jurisdiction of the East Coast Railway (ECoR) with headquarters at Bhubaneswar and some parts under South Eastern Railway and South East Central Railway.\n\n## Demographics\n\n\n### Population\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, Odisha accounted for approximately 3% of India's total population. The state had a population of 41,974,218, with 21,212,136 males (50.54%) and 20,762,082 females (49.46%), resulting in a sex ratio of 978 females per 1,000 males. This marked a growth rate of 13.97% during the 2001-2011 period, a decline from 16.25% in the previous decade (1991-2001). The population density stood at 269 people per square kilometre, with Ganjam district having the highest population among all districts in Odisha. In contrast, Debagarh district has the lowest population. The population in the age group of 0–6 years comprised 12% of the total population, with a child sex ratio of 934 females for every 1,000 males in this age group. Additionally, Scheduled Castes (SC) constituted a population of 7.2 million, making up 16.5% of the total population, while Scheduled Tribes (ST) accounted for 9.6 million, representing 22.1% of the population.\n\n### Literacy and Socioeconomic Indicators\nAccording to the 2011 Census, Odisha's overall literacy rate is 72.87%. Male literacy stands at 81.59%, while female literacy is recorded at 64.01%. Odisha's literacy rate is slightly below the national average of 74.04%. Literacy rates vary within the state, with Khordha district having the highest literacy rate at 86.88%, while Nabarangpur has the lowest at 46.43%. In rural areas, the average literacy rate is 70.22%, compared to 85.57% in urban areas. Among the Scheduled Tribe population, the literacy rate is 52.24%.\nIn terms of poverty, Odisha had a poverty rate of 57.15% in 2004–2005, nearly double the national average of 26.10% at the time. However, since 2005, the state has made significant progress, reducing the poverty rate by 24.6 percentage points, with the current estimate at 32.6%.\n\n### Health and Vital Statistics\nData from 1996–2001 indicated that the state’s life expectancy was 61.64 years, slightly above the national average. Odisha also records a birth rate of 23.2 per 1,000 people annually, a death rate of 9.1 per 1,000, an infant mortality rate of 65 per 1,000 live births. In 2011-2013, Odisha recorded a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 222 per 100,000 live births, according to a report by NITI Aayog. As of 2018, Odisha’s Human Development Index (HDI) stands at 0.606. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Odisha declined from 2.1 in 2015-16 to 1.8 in 2020-21, paralleling the national trend, which saw a decrease from 2.2 to 2.0 during the same period.\nWith a cumulative score of 67.8, Odisha tops the ranking in fiscal health index 2025.\n\n### Religion\nBased on the 2011 Census, Odisha has a predominantly Hindu population, with 93.63% adhering to Hinduism.  The state is home to several prominent Hindu pilgrimage sites, including Jagannath Puri, known for the Jagannath Temple, and the Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar, which attract devotees from across India and beyond. Christianity is the second-largest religion at 2.77%, followed by Islam at 2.17%. Smaller communities include Sikhs (0.05%), Jains (0.02%), and Buddhists (0.03%). Additionally, 1.14% of the population practices other religions, with Sarna being one of the prominent indigenous faiths, particularly among tribal communities. A small segment, 0.18%, did not state their religious affiliation.\n\n### Languages\nOdia is the official language of Odisha and is spoken by 82.70% of the population according to the 2011 Census of India. It is also one of the classical languages of India. English is the official language of correspondence between state and the union of India.  Spoken Odia is not homogeneous as one can find different dialects spoken across the state. Some of the major dialects found inside the state are Sambalpuri, Cuttacki, Sundargarhi, Baleswari, Ganjami, Desiya, Kalahandia and Phulbani. The standard language is based on the Cuttacki dialect. In addition to Odia, significant populations of people speaking other major Indian languages like Hindi, Telugu, Urdu and Bengali are also found in the state, mainly in cities.\nThe different tribal (Adivasi) communities who mostly reside in western and southern Odisha have their own languages belonging to Munda and Dravidian family of languages. Some of these major tribal languages are Santali, Kui, Mundari and Ho. Due to increasing contact with outsiders, migration and socioeconomic reasons many of these indigenous languages are slowly getting extinct or are on the verge of getting extinct.\nThe Odisha Sahitya Academy Award was established in 1957 to actively develop Odia language and literature. The Odisha government launched a portal in 2018 to promote Odia language and literature.\n\n## Education\nEntry to various institutes of higher education especially into engineering degrees is through a centralised Odisha Joint Entrance Examination, conducted by the Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT), Rourkela, since 2003, where seats are provided according to order of merit. Few of the engineering institutes enroll students by through Joint Entrance Examination. For medical courses, there is a corresponding National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test.\n\n## Culture\nOdisha is home to several Hindu figures. Sant Bhima Bhoi was a leader of the Mahima sect. Sarala Das, a Hindu Khandayat, was the translator of the epic Mahabharata into Odia. Chaitanya Das was a Buddhistic-Vaishnava and writer of the Nirguna Mahatmya. Jayadeva was the author of the Gita Govinda.\nThe Odisha Temple Authorisation Act of 1948 empowered the government of Odisha to open temples for all Hindus, including Dalits.\nPerhaps the oldest scripture of Odisha is the Madala Panji from the Puri Temple believed from 1042 AD. Famous Hindu Odia scripture includes the 16th-century Bhagabata of Jagannatha Dasa. In the modern times Madhusudan Rao was a major Odia writer, who was a Brahmo Samajist and shaped modern Odia literature at the start of the 20th century.\n\n### Cuisine\nOdisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries. The kitchen of the Shri Jagannath Temple, Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with 1,000 chefs, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called chulas, to feed over 10,000 people each day.\nThe syrupy dessert Pahala rasagola made in Odisha is known throughout the world. Chhenapoda is another major Odisha sweet cuisine, which originated in Nayagarh. Dalma (a mix of dal and selected vegetables) is widely known cuisine, better served with ghee.\n\nThe \"Odisha Rasagola\" was awarded a geographical indication (GI) tag in 2019 after a long battle about the origin of the famous sweet with West Bengal.\nThis decision involved a broader interpretation of the law established under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. Section 2(e) of the Act stipulates that a geographical indication can be provided to a product if its quality, characteristics, or reputation are attributable to its geographical origin and are unique. The uniqueness of Odisha’s Rasagola lies in its color, texture, and taste, distinguishing it from the West Bengal variant. Historical references in Odisha’s texts support the geographical origin of the dish.\n\n### Dance\nOdissi dance and music are classical art forms. Odissi is the oldest surviving dance form in India on the basis of archaeological evidence. Odissi has a long, unbroken tradition of 2,000 years, and finds mention in the Natyashastra of Bharatamuni, possibly written c. 200 BC. However, the dance form nearly became extinct during the British period, only to be revived after India's independence by a few gurus.\nThe variety of dances includes Ghumura dance, Chhau dance, Jhumair, Mahari dance, Dalkhai, Dhemsa and Gotipua.\nOdissi is not only a dance form but also a spiritual expression deeply rooted in Odisha’s temple traditions. Characterized by graceful movements, intricate footwork, and sculpturesque poses, it draws inspiration from the carvings of the Konark Sun Temple and other ancient shrines of the region. The dance is traditionally performed as an act of devotion to Lord Jagannath and often depicts stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Geeta Govinda. The unique tribhangi posture, which divides the body into three bends (head, torso, and hips), and the fluid chauka stance, give Odissi its distinctive identity among classical dances of India.\nOver centuries, Odissi has evolved from being a temple ritual to a respected performing art practiced worldwide. It blends lyrical music with expressive gestures (mudras) that communicate emotions and narratives with precision. Gurus like Kelucharan Mohapatra, Pankaj Charan Das, and others played a pivotal role in reviving and popularizing the form in the 20th century, ensuring its survival and global recognition. Today, Odissi is celebrated on prestigious stages across the world, symbolizing Odisha’s cultural heritage and artistic excellence.\nThe traditional performance of Odissi usually begins with Mangalacharan, an invocation to the deities, followed by Batu Nritya that highlights pure dance techniques. Pallavi showcases the dancer’s mastery through elaborate rhythmic patterns, while Abhinaya brings mythological stories to life through expressive storytelling. The recital often concludes with Moksha, symbolizing spiritual liberation, where the dancer blends technical skill with a deep sense of devotion. This structured presentation makes Odissi both aesthetically rich and spiritually profound.\nCostumes and music also play an important role in Odissi. Dancers typically wear brightly colored saris made of Sambalpuri or Bomkai silk, adorned with silver jewelry crafted in Odisha’s traditional style. The music is based on Odissi classical ragas and talas, blending elements of both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions, and is performed with instruments like the mardala (a traditional percussion instrument), flute, sitar, and violin. Together, the visual elegance and the melodic accompaniment create an atmosphere that connects performers and audiences to the deep cultural and devotional roots of Odisha.\n\n## Sports\nThe state of Odisha has hosted several international sporting events, including the 2018 Men's Hockey World Cup,  2022 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and 2023 Men's Hockey World Cup.\nSports stadiums in Odisha include:\n\nKalinga Stadium\nBarabati Stadium\nJawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium\nEast Coast Railway Stadium\nBiju Patnaik Hockey Stadium\nKIIT Stadium\nVeer Surendra Sai Stadium\nBirsa Munda International Hockey Stadium\nThere are some High Performance Centres in the state as well which have been set up at Kalinga Stadium for the development of respective sports in Odisha. Some of the HPCs are as follows:\n\nAbhinav Bindra Targeting Performance (ABTP)\nDalmia Bharat Gopichand Badminton Academy\nJSW Swimming HPC\nKhelo India State Centre of Excellence (KISCE) for Athletics, Hockey, and Weightlifting\nKJS Ahluwalia and Tenvic Sports HPC for Weightlifting\nOdisha Naval Tata Hockey High Performance Centre (ONTHHPC) \nOdisha Aditya Birla and Gagan Narang Shooting HPC\nReliance Foundation Odisha Athletics HPC\nSAI Regional Badminton Academy\nUdaan Badminton Academy\nAIFF High Performance Centre\n\n## Tourism\nThe Lingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar has a 150-foot (46 m) high deula while the Jagannath Temple, Puri is about 200 feet (61 m) high and dominates the skyline. Only a portion of the Konark Sun Temple at Konark in Puri district, the largest of the temples of the \"Holy Golden Triangle\" exists today, and it is still staggering in size. It stands out as a masterpiece in Odisha architecture. Sarala Temple, regarded as one of the most spiritually elevated expressions of Shaktism is in Jagatsinghpur district. It is also one of the holiest places in Odisha and a major tourist attraction. Maa Tarini Temple situated in Kendujhar district is also a famous pilgrimage destination. Every day thousands of coconuts are given to Maa Tarini by devotees for fulfilling their wishes.\nOdisha's varying topography – from the wooded Eastern Ghats to the fertile river basin – has proven ideal for evolution of compact and unique ecosystems. This creates treasure troves of flora and fauna that are inviting to many migratory species of birds and reptiles. Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapada district is famous for its second largest mangrove ecosystem. The bird sanctuary in Chilika Lake (Asia's largest brackish water lake). The tiger reserve and waterfalls in Simlipal National Park, Mayurbhanj district are integral parts of eco-tourism in Odisha, arranged by Odisha Tourism.\nDaringbadi is a hill station in the Kandhamal district. It is known as \"Kashmir of Odisha\", for its climatic similarity. Chandipur, in Baleswar district is a calm and serene site, is mostly unexplored by tourists. The unique speciality of this beach is the ebb tides that recede up to 4 km and tend to disappear rhythmically.\nIn the western part of Odisha, Hirakud Dam in Sambalpur district is the longest earthen dam in the World. It also forms the biggest artificial lake in Asia. The Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary is situated near Hirakud Dam. Samaleswari Temple is a Hindu temple in Sambalpur city, dedicated to the goddess known as 'Samaleswari', the presiding deity of Sambalpur, is a strong religious force in western part of Odisha and Chhattisgarh state. The Leaning Temple of Huma is located near Sambalpur. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Lord Bimaleshwar. Sri Sri Harishankar Devasthana, is a temple on the slopes of Gandhamardhan hills, Balangir district. It is popular for its scenes of nature and connection to two Hindu lords, Vishnu and Shiva. On the opposite side of the Gandhamardhan hills is the temple of Sri Nrusinghanath, is situated at the foothills of Gandhamardhan Hill near Paikmal, Bargarh district.\nIn the southern part of Odisha, The Taratarini Temple on the Kumari hills at the bank of the Rushikulya River near Berhampur city in Ganjam district. Here worshiped as the Breast Shrine (Sthana pitha) and manifestations of Adi Shakti. The Tara Tarini Shakta pitha is one of the oldest pilgrimage centers of the Mother Goddess and is one of four major ancient Tantra pitha and Shakta pithas in India. Deomali is a mountain peak of the Eastern Ghats. It is located in Koraput district. This peak with an elevation of about 1,672 m, is the highest peak in Odisha.\nThe share of foreign tourists' arrival in the state is below one per cent of total foreign tourist arrivals at all India level.\n\n## See also\nOutline of Odisha\nEast India\nOdia people\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nGovernment\nOfficial website \nOfficial tourism site\nGeneral information\nOdisha web resources provided by GovPubs at the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries\nOdisha at the Encyclopædia Britannica\n Wikimedia Atlas of Odisha\n Geographic data related to Odisha at OpenStreetMap",

    "text": "# Padang cuisine\n\nPadang cuisine or Minangkabau cuisine is the cuisine of the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra, Indonesia. It is among the most popular cuisines in Maritime Southeast Asia. It is known across Indonesia as masakan Padang after Padang, the capital city of Western Sumatra province.

Vegetables are mostly boiled, such as boiled cassava leaf, or simmered in thin curry as side dishes, such as gulai of young jackfruit or cabbage.\n\n## Etymology\nIn popular usage prevalent in Indonesia and neighboring countries, the term \"Padang food\" is often used generally to refer to the culinary traditions of the Minangkabau people of Western Sumatra. However, this term is seldom used in Minangkabau inland cities itself, such as Bukittinggi, a culinary hotspot in West Sumatra, where they refer to it as \"Minang cuisine\" or \"Minang food\" instead. This is partly because many Minangkabau nagari (counties) take pride in their culinary legacies, and because there are differences between Padang rice of Padang and kapau rice of Bukittinggi.\n\n## Padang restaurants\nIn Padang food establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands. They usually provide kabasuah, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent. This water is used to wash one's hands before and after eating. If a customer does not want to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a spoon and fork.\nThe food is usually cooked once per day. When eating nasi Padang (Padang rice) in restaurants, customers choose from various dishes which are left on display in high-stacked plates in the windows. In a dine-in hidang style Padang restaurant, after the customers are seated, they do not have to order. Rather, the waiter sets the table with dozens of small dishes filled with various dishes. Customers take only what they want from this array, and they pay only for what they take. The best known Padang dish is rendang, a spicy meat stew. Soto Padang (crispy beef in spicy soup) is commonly eaten for breakfast, while sate (beef satay in curry sauce served with ketupat) is served in the evening.\nThe serving style is different in nasi kapau food stalls, a Minangkabau Bukittinggi style. After the customer is seated, he or she orders specific dishes, which will be put directly upon the steamed rice or in separate small plates.\nThere are many Padang food establishments throughout Indonesia and surrounding countries, according to Ikatan Warung Padang Indonesia (Iwapin) or Warung Padang Bonds. In greater Jakarta alone there are at least 20,000 Padang restaurant establishments. Several notable Minangkabau restaurant chains are Sederhana, Garuda, Pagi Sore, Simpang Raya, Sari Ratu, Sari Bundo, Payakumbuah and Natrabu.\n\n## List of Padang foods\n\n\n### Dishes\nThe cooking method of gulai, which employing certain ingredients; meat, poultry, vegetables, fish or seafood simmered and slowly cooked in coconut milk, spice mixture and chili pepper, formed the backbone of Minangkabau cooking tradition. The thick golden, yellowish, succulent and spicy gulai sauce has become the hallmark of Padang restaurants' window displays everywhere. In Padang, smart cooking means the capability of preparing gulai. Randang (beef simmered in coconut milk and spices), asam padeh (sour and spicy stew) and kalio (watery and light-colored gravy) are just a few variations of Padang gulai.\n\nAsam padeh, sour and spicy fish stew dish.\nAyam bakar, grilled spicy chicken.\nAyam balado, chicken in chili.\nAyam bumbu, chicken with spices.\nAyam goreng, fried chicken with spicy granules.\nAyam lado ijo, chicken in green chili.\nAyam percik, grilled chicken with a spicy, curry-like sauce.\nAyam pop, Padang-style chicken, boiled/steamed and later fried.

    "text": "# Pakistani Chinese cuisine\n\nPakistani Chinese cuisine (Urdu: چینی پکوان) comprises the styles and variations of Chinese cuisine that are cooked and consumed in Pakistan. Chinese migrants to Pakistan have developed a distinct Pakistani-style Chinese cuisine.\n\n## History\nChinese cuisine in areas which today make up Pakistan has a history going back to restaurants established in the 1930s. One of these, the ABC Chinese Restaurant in Karachi, operated by a Chinese teacher Li Dianxiang, was once patronised by Zhou Enlai, and continued operating until 1988. Chinese restaurants are very popular amongst families as opposed to fast food and continental cuisine which is more favoured by the youth.\nPakistani Chinese food resembles Cantonese cuisine with its liberal use of chicken stock-based sauces seasoned with soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, monosodium glutamate and oyster sauce, but very rarely any fresh herbs. It is also a common practice in restaurants to serve Chinese dishes in sizzling platters. Vegetables used in Chinese cuisine are mostly cabbage, capsicum and onion, since broccoli or bok choy are not native vegetables. The extent of the popularity of Chinese food can be estimated from the fact that Chinese variations of local dishes have become quite popular like Chinese samosa, Chinese broast, and Chinese pulao.\nSome newly opened restaurants like Ginsoy have been prospering in the city of Karachi. The food offered at Chinese restaurants in Karachi is a blend of Chinese cooking with Pakistani style influences. More recently in Islamabad, the Phoenix restaurant has become well-known. Their clientele includes ex-president Pervez Musharraf and ex-prime minister Shaukat Aziz; Musharraf is said to enjoy their prawns, Peking duck, stir-fried beef, and garlic lamb chops. Chicken Manchurian, one of the most popular Pakistani Chinese dishes, is an Indo-Chinese dish that normally consists of chicken with occasional vegetables in a spicy sauce. It is entirely a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, being consumed in India and Pakistan in general, and bears little resemblance to traditional Chinese cuisine.\n\n## Dishes\nAmongst some of the most popular Pakistani-Chinese dishes are:\n\nChicken Manchurian - the most popular dish with pieces of stir fried chicken served in a red ketchup based sauce. It is normally served with egg or chicken fried rice.\nChicken with Lime - stir fried chicken served in a sizzling lemon and/or lime sauce.\nSweet and Sour Chicken or Prawns - meat, capsicum, onions and pineapple chunks with a red sweet and sour sauce.\nChinese rice - Basmati is the most common form of rice used. The most famous rice recipes are egg and chicken fried rice.\nChicken Honey Wings - Chicken wings dipped in a coating of sweet honey paste.\nChinese soup - Chicken corn soup and hot and sour soup are ubiquitous in restaurants, homes, and on TV. These are served with staples such as vinegar (sirka) and chili pepper.\nNoodles - Chicken chowmein and chopsuey are popular. Their method of cooking employs hearty use of soy sauce, ajinomoto, vinegar and chili sauce with vegetables, boneless chicken and/or Keema (minced meat). Oil concentrations are higher than normal Chinese noodles.\n\n## See also\nChinese cuisine\nIndian Chinese cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\nYasin, Aamir (23 November 2015). \"Why do Pakistanis love Chinese food so much?\".

Additionally, as a result of lifestyle changes, health trends, and new dietary research being published, traditional ingredients such as masala (pre-mixed and ready-to-use) and ghee (clarified butter)—with its health benefits and high smoke point—have been increasingly popular.\n\n## Historical influences\nPakistan's national cuisine directly inherits from Indo-Aryan, Turko-Persian, Iranic, and Arab, and it is heavily influenced by Muslim culinary practices. Evidence of controlled preparatory cuisine in the region can be traced back to as early as the Bronze Age with the Indus Valley Civilization. Around 3000 BCE, sesame, eggplant, and humped cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley; spices like turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in the region concurrently. For a thousand years, wheat and rice served as basic comestibles in the Indus Valley region.\nThe arrival of Islam through trade and conquests by various Arab, Turkic, Persian, and Afghan dynasties influenced the local cuisine of the region to a great degree. Due to its Muslim-majority population, Pakistan's cuisine sees a strict observance of Islamic dietary laws. Most prominently, forbiddance on the consumption of pork and alcohol by Islamic regulation has shifted the focus of Pakistani cuisine to other types of meat, such as beef, lamb, chicken, and fish, alongside a variety of fruits, vegetables, and dairy.\n\n## Elements\nPakistani dishes are known for being aromatic. Some dishes contain liberal amounts of oil, contributing to a richer, fuller mouthfeel and flavour. Brown cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, star anise and black pepper are the most commonly used spices in the making of a wide variety of dishes throughout Pakistan. Cumin seeds, chili powder, turmeric, and bay leaves are also very popular. In the Punjab province, spice blends are characterized by their use of coriander powder. Garam masala (a mixture of aromatic spices) is a popular blend of spices used in several Pakistani dishes including Bannu Pulao.\n\n## Regional cuisines\n\n\n### Balochistan\nBalochi cuisine originates from Pakistan's Balochistan region, yet many of its dishes have gained nationwide acclaim. Among the most popular Balochi dishes are Balochi sajji (skewered lamb or chicken stuffed with rice), mutton rosh (mutton chops) and dampukht (meat slow-cooked in its own fats). Influenced by Iranian culinary traditions, Balochi cuisine is known for its aromatic character while being non-spicy.\n\n### Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\nThe culinary traditions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are deeply rooted in Pashtun or Afghan culture and are heavily influenced by Iranic culinary traditions. Pashtun cuisine is characterized by a preference for rice-based dishes, kebabs, and lamb. Prominent dishes include Kabuli palaw, a flavorful rice dish with meat, carrots, and dried fruits; bannu pulao, a beef and stock-based rice dish; chapli kabab, a spiced and crispy minced meat patty; tika, marinated and grilled meat skewers; and mutton karahi, a savory, rich stew. Local variations such as Peshawari cuisine further showcase the diverse culinary practices of the region. Like Balochi cuisine, Pashtun cuisine is traditionally non-spicy. In recent years, rosh has taken traction with locals who enjoy the Balochi dish.\n\n### Punjab\nThe Punjab province is home to various ethnic groups, resulting in variations in cuisine across the region. Despite these differences, many dishes from Punjab have gained popularity across the region and throughout Pakistan.\nNorthern Punjab, situated in the Potohar Plateau, is known for dishes such as kunna gosht (mutton slow-cooked in a clay pot), hareesa (a smooth blend of wheat, lentils, and meat), and kofta curry (spiced meatballs in a savory gravy), often enjoyed with soft, sesame-topped roghni naan.\nIn Central and Eastern Punjab, signature dishes include murgh/mutton/beef pulao, a fragrant rice dish cooked with spices and meat; saag, a mustard leaf-based dish traditionally cooked on low heat in pure ghee paired with makai roti (maize flour flatbread); paye/kharoray, a slow-cooked stew made from the legs and joints of cow, goat, buffalo, or sheep; murgh cholay, a flavorful curry of chicken and chickpeas often served with roghni naan; and lassi, a refreshing yogurt-based drink. Additionally, dishes such as nihari (a slow-cooked meat stew), haleem (a rich porridge of wheat, lentils, and meat), and karahi gosht (a spicy curry cooked in a wok-like vessel) are staples. The food in this region is traditionally moderately spicy.\n\n### Sindh\nSindhi cuisine refers to the traditional culinary practices of the Sindhi people from the Sindh province of Pakistan. Like most Pakistani culinary traditions, it is predominantly meat-based, with chicken and mutton forming the cornerstone of most meals. Signature dishes of the Sindhi people include Sindhi biryani, karhi, daal pakwan, palo fish, and bhugal gosht. Sindhi cuisine is typically not spicy, focusing on aromatic and balanced flavors. In contrast, the cuisine of Karachi, the capital of Sindh, reflects the influence of its Muhajir (Indian immigrant) population, which constitutes a significant portion of the city’s residents along with other communities in the city which further contribute to Karachi’s diverse cuisine. Karachi’s food is known for its bold and spicy flavors.\n\n### Gilgit-Baltistan\nGilgit Baltistan is rich in unique food and dishes, each district of Gilgit Baltistan has their cultural dish that symbolizes the people.\nGilgiti cuisine is the cuisine of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is typically non-spicy, but rich in flavors. Prominent Gilgiti dishes, such as the Chapshoro have gained massive popularity among different parts of Pakistan. Mumtu (dumplings) is another popular dish, often served with yogurt and parsley and black pepper, vinegar, chili sauce.\n\n## Main courses\nIn Pakistan, main courses are usually served with wheat bread (either roti or naan) or rice. Salad is generally taken as a side dish with the main course, rather than as an appetizer beforehand. \nMeat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani food, compared to other South Asian cuisines. According to a 2003 report, an average Pakistani consumed three times more meat than an average Indian. Of all the meats, the most popular are goat, lamb and mutton, beef and chicken, which are particularly sought after as the meats of choice for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan and was a dominant element of the cuisine of the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).\nDishes, with or without meat, combined with local vegetables, such as bitter gourd, cauliflower, eggplant, okra, cabbage, potatoes, rutabaga, saag, and chili peppers are most common and cooked for everyday consumption. A typical example is aloo gosht (literally \"potatoes and meat\"), a homestyle recipe consisting of a spiced meat and potato stew, prepared in many households. Korma is a classic dish of Mughlai origin made of either chicken or mutton, typically eaten with naan or other bread, and is very popular in Pakistan.\n\n## Vegetable and legume dishes\nThere are plenty of vegetarian-friendly vegetable and legume dishes popular in Pakistan. These are often cooked using traditional spices and flavoring agents such as chilis, turmeric, garlic, ginger, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, and fennel seeds. Dishes such as baingan bartha and sarson da saag are typical examples eaten in most homes. Aloo mutter is made with potatoes and peas.\nThere are plenty of vegetables which are grown seasonally in Pakistan, which are cooked into curries which are eaten for lunch or dinner. Some vegetable dishes, such as aloo paratha and channa puri, are also consumed for breakfast.\n\n## Meat dishes\nThe meat dishes in Pakistan include beef, mutton, poultry and seafood dishes. Chicken karahi is a famous poultry dish. The meat is usually cut in 3 cm cubes and cooked in a stew. Minced meat is used for kebabs, qeema, and other dishes. Meat dishes may also be cooked with pulses, legumes and rice. The camel, rabbit, many birds like Aari (Fulica atra), Kunj (Demoiselle crane), Titar (Grey francolin), Jhirkri (sparrow), Duck meat is also consumed.\n\n### Barbecue and kebabs\nMeat and grilled meat have played an important role in Pakistan for centuries. Kebabs are a staple item in Pakistani cuisine today, and one can find countless varieties all over the country. Each region has its own varieties, but some, like seekh kebab, chicken tikka, and shami kebab are eaten throughout the country.\n\n## Pulses\nVarious kinds of pulses or legumes make up an important part of Pakistani cuisine. While lentils (called daal) and chickpeas (called channa/chanay ki daal) are popular ingredients in homestyle cooking, they are traditionally considered to be inexpensive food sources. As such, they are typically not served to guests who are invited for dinner or during special occasions. Meat may be combined with lentils and pulses, whether in simple preparations or in elaborate dishes such as haleem.\nBeans such as black-eyed peas (lobia) and kidney beans (rajma) are sometimes served in a tomato-based masala sauce, especially in Punjab.\nChickpeas, red kidney beans, and other legumes are also popular in Pakistani cooking. They are usually cooked in a spicy gravy and served with rice or traditional flatbread (roti). Chickpeas, known as channa, are also a common breakfast food when served with puri. Channa chaat is another favorite street food and iftaar dish; it is made of chickpeas, chopped onions, tomatoes, and chillies, and seasoned with spices (chaat masala) and tamarind paste.\nA wide variety of lentils is consumed in Pakistan and frequently with rice. Daal chawaal (lentils and rice) is known as a popular comfort food in many Pakistani households.\n\n## Rice dishes\nPakistan is a major exporter and consumer of rice. Basmati is the most popular type of rice consumed in Pakistan.\nDishes made with rice include many varieties of pulao:\n\nBannu pulao – A classic dish from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that combines beef, spices, and rice. The beef is slow-cooked with bones for a rich, flavorful taste, while the rice is prepared separately with ghee and aromatic spices.\nChana pulao – Pulao with chickpeas; a commonly served vegetarian pulao in Punjab.\nMatar pulao – Pulao made with peas.\nMurgh pulao – Chicken and stock added. Creates a brown rice.\nYakhni pulao – Meat and stock added. Creates a brown rice.\nKabuli palaw – an Afghan dish, common in Pashtun-dominated regions in Pakistan such as the Tribal Areas, FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in North-West Pakistan, and Balochistan in South-West Pakistan. It is a variety of pilaf, consisting of steamed rice mixed with raisins, carrots, and lamb.\nBiryani is a commonly served dish in Pakistan, and has many varieties, such as Lahori and Sindhi biryani. Tahiri, which is a vegetarian form of biryani, is also popular. All of the main dishes (except those made with rice) are eaten alongside bread.  Pickles made out of mangoes, carrots, lemon, and other fruits and vegetables are also commonly used to further spice up the food.\n\n## Varieties of bread\nPakistanis eat breads made of wheat flour as a staple part of their diet. Pakistan has a wide variety of breads, often prepared in a tandoor. The tandoori style of cooking is common throughout rural and urban Pakistan, and also has strong roots in neighboring India, Iran and Afghanistan. Some of these are:\n\nChapati – Most common bread made in urban homes, where a tandoor is not available. Chapatis are cooked over a flat or slightly convex dark colored pan known as 'tava'. Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour and are thin and unleavened. Tortillas are probably the most common analogue to chapatis, though chapatis are slightly thicker. A variant, known as 'romali roti' (lit. 'handkerchief bread'), is very thin and very large.\nMakkai ki roti, a yellowish-golden-colour chapati which is made with pure crushed corns. It is mostly served with saag, a traditional winter curry.\nKandahari naan – Long, salty naan originating in western Pakistan and commonly eaten with Peshawari karahi or chapli kebab.\nKulcha – This type of naan is usually eaten with chickpeas and potatoes and mostly popular in urban centers of Punjab.\nNaan – In Urdu, the national language of Pakistan, the word naan means 'bread'. Unlike chapatis, naans are slightly thicker, typically leavened with yeast and mainly made with white flour. Some varieties like roghani and Peshwari naan may also be sprinkled with sesame seeds. Naans are seldom, if ever, made at home since they require tandoor-based cooking and  preparatory work. Numerous varieties of plain and stuffed naans are available throughout Pakistan and each region or city can have its own specialty. Naan is a versatile bread and is eaten with almost anything. For instance, 'saada naan' or 'plain naan' is often served with siri-payay (cow's head and trotters) or nihari (slow-cooked beef stew) for breakfast in many parts of the country.\nParatha – A flat, layered bread made with ghee or cooking oil and generally cooked on a 'tava'. However, a 'tandoor'-based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas are very similar to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the Punjab, where a heavy breakfast of parathas with freshly churned butter and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard day of work ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as aloo ka paratha (potato-stuffed paratha), mooli ka paratha (radish-stuffed paratha), and qeemah ka paratha (ground meat-stuffed paratha) are common.\nPuri – This is a breakfast bread made of white flour and fried. Typically eaten with sweet semolina halwa or gravy (made out of chickpeas and potatoes). Puri is a fairly urban concept, not part of rural cuisine anywhere in Pakistan. However, halwa puri has now become a favored weekend or holiday breakfast in urban Pakistan, where it is sometimes sold in shift carts or in specialty breakfast shops.\nRoghani naan (lit. 'buttered naan') – Naan sprinkled with white sesame seeds and cooked with a small amount of oil.\n \nOfrata: Sindhi paratha made with oil and ghee. A four-cornered ofrato is called a chokundo, and a three-cornered ofrato is called a trikundo.\nBusri: a special Sindhi and Saraiki sweet bread made of two ofratas, crushed jaggery powder or sugar filled in, cooked with desi ghee and makhan (butter).\nBajray ki roti or bajhar mani: pearl millet bread made in rural areas, particularly in Punjab and Sindh in winter.\n \nChawaran ji mani: rice flour bread made in Sindh; it is common in upper (north) Sindh.\nRoti – This bread is very common all over Pakistan. Tandoori rotis are baked in a tandoor, and are consumed with just about anything. In rural Pakistan, many houses have their own tandoors, while the ones without it use a communal one. In urban Pakistan, bread shops or nanbai/tandoor shops are fairly common and supply fresh, tandoor-baked breads to household customers.\nSheermal – Saffron-flavored traditional flatbread. It is a festive bread prepared with milk ('sheer') and butter with added candied fruits. Sheermal is often a vital part of food served in marriages, along with taftan. It is often sweetened.\nTaftan – Leavened flour bread with saffron and a small amount of cardamom powder, baked in a tandoor. The taftan made in Pakistan is slightly sweeter and richer than the one made in neighboring Iran.\n\n## Desserts\nPopular desserts include Peshawari ice cream, sheer khurma, qulfi, falooda, kheer, Firni, zarda, shahi tukray and rabri. Sweetmeats are consumed on various festive occasions in Pakistan. Some of the most popular are gulab jamun, barfi, ras malai, kalakand, jalebi and panjiri. Pakistani desserts also include a long list of halva, such as Multani Halwa, hubshee, Gajar ka halwa, sohan halvah, Ugham Halwo, Sindhi Halwo, Seero.\nKheer made of roasted seviyaan (vermicelli) instead of rice is popular during Eid ul-Fitr. Gajraila is a sweet made from grated carrots, boiled in milk, sugar, cream and green cardamom, topped with nuts and dried fruit.\n\n## Tea varieties\nPakistanis drink a great deal of tea, locally called \"chai\". Both black (with milk) and green teas are popular and there are different varieties common in different parts of Pakistan. \n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral, as well as areas near the Chinese border, salty Tibetan-style butter tea is consumed.\nDoodh pati chai is made by cooking tea leaves with milk and sugar, sometimes served with cardamom for fragrance. Extremely sweet, this is a local variation of a builder's tea.\n\"Kashmiri chai\" or \"noon chai\", a pink, milky tea with pistachios and cardamom, is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter, when it is sold in many kiosks. However, unlike Kashmir the Kashmiri Chai in Pakistan is prepared with sugar and not with salt.\n\"Sabz chai\" or \"kahwah\", a green tea often served after every meal in Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan, served with saffron and nuts.\nSulaimani chai is black tea served with lemon.\n\n## Beverages\nBesides tea, there are other drinks that may be included as part of the Pakistani cuisine. All of them are non-alcoholic as the consumption of alcohol is prohibited by Islam. During the 20th century, beverages such as coffee and soft drinks have become popular in Pakistan. It is common to have soft drinks with Pakistani meals.\n\nBaraf Gola – Frozen Ice in a cup mould with syrup as a topping\nKashmiri chai/Gulabi chai – A milky tea known for its pink color, with an either sweet or salty taste\nLassi – Milk with yogurt, with an either sweet or salty taste\nLemonade (Limu pani)\nQehwa – Green tea with cardamom\nSherbet (syrup mixed in water)\nSugarcane juice (Ganney ka ras)\nThadal – A sweet drink from Sindh\n\n## Foreign influences\nIn addition to the traditional food, fast food is also very popular across the country. Occasionally, people in Pakistan dine out at restaurants with foreign-influenced food, such as Western, Arab and Chinese dishes. \nOutside Pakistan, Pakistani cuisine is prevalent in countries where there are large Pakistani communities present.\nPakistani food makes use of fresh, hand-pounded masalas. Ghee is used, but the main component of the meal or a dish is meat (beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or fish), vegetables or pulses. Since the cuisine is very similar to Punjabi-style of cooking, tikka, simmered dals, tawa sabzi, and chaat feature here.\n\n## See also\nCulture of Pakistan\nList of Pakistani breads\nList of Pakistani condiments\nList of Pakistani soups and stews\nList of Pakistani spices\nNihari Houses\nPakistani pickle\nSouth Asian sweets\nIndian cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Pakistani meat dishes\n\nMeat plays a much more dominant role in Pakistani cuisine as compared to other South Asian cuisines. The most popular are chicken, lamb, beef, goat, and fish. Beef is particularly sought after for kebab dishes or the classic beef shank dish nihari. Seafood is generally not consumed in large amounts, though it is very popular in the coastal areas of Sindh and the Makran coast of Balochistan.\n\n## Halal\nMuslims follow the Islamic law that lists foods and drinks that are Halal and permissible to consume. The criteria specify both what foods are allowed, and how the food must be prepared.  The foods addressed are mostly types of meat/animal tissue.\n\n## Meat dishes\nPakistani dishes can best be categorised by whether they contain gravy or not. Dishes with gravy which have lentils or legumes as the main ingredient are known as dals in Urdu. The remaining gravied dishes are called salaans. Salaans containing meat will either have meat on its own or in combination with a second major ingredient, such as a vegetable, or a grain or a legume. Salaans which contain meat as its main ingredient can be further subdivided by the type of meat involved. Meats normally used in Pakistani cuisine are beef, lamb, goat, chicken and occasionally game. Offal is also used in several Pakistani dishes. \nSalaans with meat as their main ingredient include the well-known Pakistani dishes nihari, kunna, qorma and qeema. The first two are stews which are most frequently made using beef and mutton respectively. Qormas are stews which can be made with a variety of meats, and are flavoured with beaten yoghurt or nut pastes. Qeemas are made with minced meat, usually beef or lamb or more rarely poultry.  \nSalaans frequently combine meat and seasonal vegetables. Favourite combinations are beef/goat/lamb with spinach/turnips/radishes/gourds/potatoes/tomatoes/peppers/aubergines. Meat can also be combined with legumes, to produce dal gosht (meat and lentils), haleem (meat with lentils and grains), and harees or hareesa (meat with lentils and grains). \nMeat combined with grains are the basis for biryani and pilaf, in which rice is combined with beef/lamb/chicken/goat. \nOffal is widely available and is a favourite for both home cooking as well as in restaurants. Liver, kidneys, heart and trotters are the main offal items cooked at home. All of these together with testicles, tripe, brains and lungs are cooked in restaurants. Speciality offal restaurants, known as takatak or kata-kat, combine customer-specified offal items with butter, tomatoes, peppers etc.    \n\nGenerally, the preparation method involves cooking pieces of meat over medium heat with various spices, or simmered with potatoes.\n\n## Barbecue and kebabs\nMeat has played an important part in the region of Pakistan for centuries. Sajji is a Baluchi dish from Western Pakistan, made up of lamb with spices, that has also become popular all over the country. Another Balochi meat dish involves building a large outdoor fire and slowly cooking chickens. The chickens are placed on skewers which are staked into the ground close to the fire, so that the radiant heat slowly cooks the prepared chickens.\nKebabs are a staple item in Pakistani cuisine today, and one can find countless varieties all over the country. Each region has its own varieties but some, like Seekh kebab, Chicken Tikka, and Shami kebab, are especially popular varieties throughout the country. Generally, kebabs from Balochistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are identical to the Afghan style of barbecue, with salt and coriander being the only seasoning used. Karachi and the wider Sindh region arefamous for their spicy kebabs, often marinated in a mixture of spices, lemon juice and dahi (yogurt). Grilled chicken and mutton are also very popular in some cities of Punjab such as Lahore, Gujranwala and Sialkot. Kebab shops are said to be the most profitable food businesses in Pakistan.\n\n### Kebabs\nTypes of kebabs (mainly made of beef or lamb) are:\n\nSeekh kebab (Urdu: سيخ کباب) - A long skewer of beef mixed with herbs and seasonings. Takes its name from the skewer.\nShami kebab (Urdu: شامی کباب) - A Shami kebab is a small patty of minced beef or chicken and ground chickpeas and spices.\nChapli kebab (Urdu: چپلی کباب) - A spiced, tangy round kebab made of ground beef and cooked in animal fat. A speciality of Peshawar in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\nChicken kebab (Urdu: مرغ کباب) (Moorgh-Kuh-bob) - A popular kebab that is found both with bone and without.\nLamb kebab (Urdu: کبابِ برہ گوشت) - The all lamb meat kebab is usually served as cubes.\nBihari kebab (Urdu: بہاری کباب) - Skewer of beef mixed with herbs and seasoning.\nShashlik (Urdu: شیشلیک ) - Grilled baby lamb chops (usually from the leg), typically marinated\nBun kebab (Urdu: بن کباب) - A unique kebab sandwich with beef, lamb, fish or chicken.\nShawarma (Urdu: شاورما) - Comprises slices cut from a stack of meat strips (usually lamb), grilled in a vertical rotisserie.

The rice should be soaked in water for at least 30 minutes before cooking. The unsoaked rice takes 25 minutes to parboil, whereas the soaked grains take only 15 minutes. Rice should be parboiled till al dente. Place the presoaked rice into a pot with some cold tap water at a ratio of about 1 cup rice to 1.5 cups water. Cook the rice, with the pot lid open, at medium heat till the water is mostly evaporated and tiny pockets of air are visibly forming in the rice as the water level evaporates and goes down below the rice. Once the water is almost fully evaporated, turn the heat to its lowest possible setting and close the lid with as tight a seal as possible. The aim now is to let the last bit of water steam in the pot and the rice will become al dente in the steam, this usually takes anywhere from 3 to 7 minutes.\n\n## Rice dishes\nThe following is a list of most popular rice dishes in Pakistan.\n\n## See also\nList of rice dishes\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nPakistani Food",

Many social gatherings, wedding ceremonies and religious festivals often include a social celebration of food, and the flavors of sweets are an essential element of such a celebration.\n\n## History\nAncient Sanskrit literature from India mention feasts and offerings of mithas (sweet). Rigveda mentions a sweet cake made of barley called apūpa, where barley flour was either fried in ghee or boiled in water, and then dipped in honey. Malpua preserves both the name and the essentials of this preparation. One of the more complete surviving texts, with extensive descriptions of sweets and how to prepare them, is the Mānasollāsa (Sanskrit: मानसोल्लास; meaning in Sanskrit, the delight of an idea, or delight of mind and senses). This ancient encyclopedia on food, music and other Indian arts is also known as the Abhilaṣitārtha Cintāmaṇi (the magical stone that fulfils desires). Mānasollāsa was composed about 1130 CE, by the Hindu King Somesvara III. The document describes meals that include a rice pudding called payasam (Sanskrit: पायसं), known as kheer in other South Asian languages. The document mentions seven kinds of rice.\n\nMānasollāsa also describes recipes for golamu, a donut from wheat flour that is scented with cardamom; gharikas, a fried cake from black gram flour and sugar syrup; chhana, a fresh cheese and rice flour fritter soaked in sugar syrup that the document suggests should be prepared from strained curdled milk mixed with buttermilk; and many others. Mānasollāsa mentions numerous milk-derived sweets and describes how to make milk solids and condensed milk. It also contains methods for souring milk to produce sweets.\nThe origin of sweets in the Indian subcontinent has been traced to at least 500 BCE when, records suggest, both raw sugar (gur, vellam, jaggery) and refined sugar (sarkara) were being produced. By 300 BCE, kingdom officials in India were acknowledging five kinds of sugar in official documents. By the Gupta dynasty era (300–500 CE), sugar was being made not only from sugar cane, but from other plant sources such as palm. Sushruta Samhita records about sugar being produced from mahua flowers, barley (yavasa) and honey and Sugar-based foods were also used in temple offerings as bhoga for the deities which, after the prayers, became prasād for devotees, the poor, or visitors to the temple.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n### Adhirasam\nAdhirasam is a sweet similar to a doughnut originating from Tamil cuisine made from rice flour, jaggery, butter and pepper.\n\n### Bal mithai\nBal mithai is a brown chocolate-like fudge, made with roasted khoya, coated with white sugar balls, and is a popular sweet from Kumaon. It is said to be invented in Almora bazaars in early twentieth century and since then has become a symbol of Kumaoni cuisine.\n\n### Barfi\nBarfi is a sweet made from milk solids (khoya) or condensed milk and other ingredients like ground cashews or pistachios. Some barfis use various flours such as besan (gram flour). Barfi may be flavored with pastes or pieces of fruit such as mango, banana, berries, or coconut. They may also include aromatic spices such as cardamom and rose water as flavorings.\n\n### Chhena murki\nChhena murki is a sweet made from chhena, milk, and sugar. It originated in Bhadrak, but is now popular throughout Odisha and other parts of India. To prepare chhena murki, milk and sugar are boiled to a thick consistency. Chhena is soaked in the mixture. Flavorings and spices are typically added.\n\n### Chhena poda\nChhena poda ('burnt cheese' in Odia) is a dessert from Odisha. It is made of well-kneaded chhena, sugar, cashews, and raisins. It is baked for several hours until it browns.\n\n### Chikki\nChikki is a ready-to-eat solid, brittle sweet generally made from casting a mix of dry nuts and hot jaggery syrup. Peanuts and jaggery mix are most common. Other than almonds, cashews, walnuts, sesame and other seeds, varieties of chikki are also prepared from puffed or roasted Bengal gram, puffed rice, beaten rice, puffed seasonal grains, and regional produce such as Khobara (desiccated coconut). Like many Indian sweets, Chikki is typically a high protein delicacy.\n\n### Chomchom\nChomchom is a traditional Bengali sweet, prepared from flattened paneer (a form of curdled milk solids, cheese) sweetened in syrup.\n\n### Gajar Pak or Gajrela\nGajar Pak, also called Gajrela, is a seasonal pudding-like sweet made from carrots.

Imarti is a variant of Jalebi, with a different flour mixture and has tighter coils. Typically Jalebi is brown or yellow, while Imarti is reddish in colour. The sweet is often enjoyed with milk, tea, yogurt or Lassi. In classical Sanskrit literature, jalebis have been referred to as kundalika or jalavallika.\n\n### Kesari bhath\nKesari bhath is a sweet dish made of semolina, sugar, ghee.

Semolina is roasted and boiled with very little water when it loses its water content sugar and ghee are added. Often cardamom and Cloves are added for the aromatic smell.\n\n### Khaja\nKhaja is a sweet of India. Refined wheat flour, sugar, and oils are the chief ingredients of khaja.\nIt is believed that, even 2000 years ago, Khaja was prepared in the southern side of the Gangetic Plains of Bihar. These areas, which are home to the sweet, once comprised the central part of the Maurya and Gupta empires. Presently, Khajas are prepared and sold in the city of Patna, Gaya and several other places across the state of Bihar. Khajas of the Silao and Rajgir are known for their puffiness.\nKhajas have traveled to other parts of the Indian subcontinent, including Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The Khaja of Kakinada, a coastal town of Andhra Pradesh, is famous in South India and Orissa. This Khaja is dry on the outside and full of sugar syrup on the inside. The Khaja of Puri is also very famous. Khajas are made by first mixing a batter of wheat flour, mawa and oil. The batter is then deep fried until crisp. Next, a sugar syrup is made which is known as \"pak\".

It is also known as payasam. Phirni is a popular variation of kheer.\nPayasam has been a cultural dish throughout the history of the Indian subcontinent and is usually served during ceremonies, feasts and celebrations. In many parts of India, ancient traditions maintain that a wedding is not fully blessed if payasam is not served at the feast during traditional ceremonies like marriage, childbirth, annaprasan (first solid feed to child), and other occasions. Other than sweet yogurt, some families serve kheer during the last meal, as auspicious food, before a family member or guest departs on a long journey away from the home.\n\n### Kozhukatta\nKozhukatta is a traditional sweet dumpling from Kerala and Sri Lankan Catholics. It is made up of thickened rice flour and variations of the filling may include using coconut, jaggery or sugar. It is closely associated with modak and mochi.\n\n### Kulfi\nKulfi is traditional South Asian ice-cream. It is made using flavored milk that is first condensed and caramelized by slow cooking along with a small quantity of rice or seasonal grain flour; once condensed, dry nut pastes and aromatic spices are added and the mix frozen in small earthen or metal cans. This creates a dense form of frozen dessert; it is typically served between −10 and −15 °C when it is easier to spoon and eat. Kulfi comes in a variety of flavors such as mango, saffron, pistachios, badam (almond), coconut and plain. It is also a street side summertime snack and festive sweet, which food hawkers carry around in a big earthen pot and play a particular horn music to attract customers. These vendors are known as kulfiwalla (those who sell kulfi).\n\n### Laddu\nLaddu (sometimes transliterated as laddoo or laadu) is made of varieties of flour, grains, pulses, semolina, regional or seasonal fruits, dry fruits, and other ingredients cooked with sugar. These are then shaped into bite-size or larger spheres. Laddu is mentioned in ancient Sanskrit documents as temple offerings, and is referred to as ladduka. It is popular all over India, is easy to prepare, and comes in dozens of varieties. Laddu is often served during festivals, religious ceremonies, or household events such as weddings.\nOne example of laddu is Motichoor ka Ladoo. It is a sweet food popular in states like Bihar. It is made from roasted gram flour flakes which are sweetened, mixed with almonds, rolled into a batter and then cast into mini balls and fried in ghee. Every mini ball, called boondi, melts like a fresh sweet. The mini balls are combined with aromatic spices and then formed into bite-size spheres, which are called motichoor ka ladoo. With each bite, the mini balls distribute a burst of flavor throughout the mouth. Other examples include Tirupati laddu, so popular that over a million laddu are distributed every week from a single temple of Lord Venkateswara.\n\n### Malpua\nMalpua is a deep fried wheat or rice flour pancake soaked in sugar syrup.

Some are white in color while others are cream, brown, gold or orange. They are called Rasbari in Nepal. This dish is made by boiling small dumplings made of a mixture of chhenna and semolina in sugar syrup. Once cooked, these are stored in the syrup, making them spongy. Increasing the semolina content reduces the sponginess of the dessert and hardens them, creating a variety of textures. Some Rasgulla are stuffed inside with treats, such as dry fruits, raisins, candied peel, and other delicacies to create a variety of flavors. Some versions, called danedhar, are removed from the syrup and sugar-coated into different fruit shapes and other creative designs. These are festive foods found year-round in many parts of India.\n\n### Ras malai\nRas malai consists of flattened balls of chhena (cheese curds) soaked in malai (clotted cream) flavored with cardamom. Its name comes from the Hindu/Urdu ras, \"juice,\" and malai, \"cream.\"\n\n### Sandesh\nSandesh is a Bengali sweet made from chhena (cheese curds) kneaded with sugar. A variation called nolen gurher sandesh is made from date molasses instead of sugar.\n\n### Sel roti\nSel roti is a Nepali home-made circular-shaped bread or rice donut that is prepared during Tihar, a widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal and India (Sikkim and Darjeeling regions). It is made of rice flour and incorporates customized flavors. A semi liquid rice flour dough is usually prepared by adding together milk, water, sugar, butter, cardamom, cloves as well as other flavors based on personal choice.\n\n### Shrikhand\nShrikhand is a traditional Gujarati and Marathi dessert made from strained yogurt, sugar, saffron, and cardamom.

    "text": "# Palembang cuisine\n\nPalembangese cuisine is the cuisine of the Palembangese people of the city of Palembang in the South Sumatra province of Indonesia. It is the second most well-known cuisine from Sumatra after Padang.\n\n## Ingredients\nPalembang cuisine primarily uses freshwater fish and prawns as key ingredients due to the paramount role of the Musi River for the area. Popular freshwater fish includes patin (Pangasius), baung (Hemibagrus), lais (Kryptopterus cryptopterus), lele (catfish), gabus (snakehead), mas (carp) and gurame (gourami). Historically, Palembang waters were teeming with belido (giant featherback), and it has become the city's official animal mascot. It is valued for its succulent flavour and soft texture. However, due to overfishing, today the belido fish are scarce and probably already extinct in Musi river area.\nBecause of its location that is not far from the sea, seafood such as shrimp, tenggiri (wahoo), kakap merah (red snapper) and Spanish mackerel are also popular in Palembang.\nBesides freshwater fish dishes, there are many variations of dishes, snacks, drinks, and sweets in Palembang cuisine.\n\n## Spices and flavouring\nSpices are also generally included although not as liberally as its same-island counterpart.

While like most of noodle dishes of Indonesia, mie celor can trace its origin back to Chinese influences.\nIt was popularly believed that Palembang preference of sweet flavour was due to Javanese influences that favouring palm sugar. Indeed, Palembang absorb many Javanese elements, including language and cuisine. For example, both Javanese and Palembang Malay dialects refer fish as iwak, and cooking method employing banana leaf package as brengkes or brengkesan.\nMartabak Palembang and nasi minyak which uses ghee, on the other hand, demonstrate Indian cuisine influence in the city.\n\n## Dishes\nPalembang dishes are well known for its extensive use of freshwater fish, its practice of making surimi-like fishcakes as the base of various recipes, also the use of palm sugar, coconut milk, vinegar or tamarind as flavouring agent.

Examples include lenjer (long), keriting (curly), kapal selam (literally \"submarine\", filled with egg), ada`an (round and fried) and pistel (filled with cooked young papaya). Not every fish can be made into authentic Palembang pempek. A real authentic Palembang pempek is made of giant featherback (Chitala lopis) as its main ingredients. However, since the species is threatened, an authentic pempek can also be made with several other fish such as striped snakehead (Channa striata), narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson), or snappers (Lutjanus sp.).\nTekwan, are small pempek balls served with fresh prawn soup, cellophane noodles, and ear mushrooms, often portrayed as the Palembang version of bakso.\nModel, are a variety of pempek with tofu fillings served with fresh prawn soup and cellophane noodles (model iwak). The pempek ingredients can be substituted with fried bread (model gendum).\nLaksan, are thick sliced pempek lenjer poured with spicy coconut milk and served with prawn powders.\nCelimpungan, are like laksan but with large sized tekwan balls instead of sliced pempek. A coconut milk gravy, enriching the dish's taste, is another highlight to notice. The thick sauce is simmered with turmeric, pepper, and bay leaves.\n Mie Celor, are yellow noodles like Japanese soba poured with coconut milk, prawns, and boiled egg.\nBurgo, are folded pancakes made of rice flour which are sliced and served with whitish coconut milk soup, snakehead fish or powdered prawns.\nLakso, is similar to burgo, but lakso made of thick rice noodles and its soup has yellowish color acquired from turmeric.\nRagit, the looks of this kind of bread is similar to Malay culinary signature, Lace Bread or well known as Roti Jala.

    "text": "# Paneer\n\nPaneer (pronounced [/pəˈniːr/]), is a fresh acid-set cheese, common in cuisine of South Asia, made from cow milk or buffalo milk. It is a non-aged, non-melting soft cheese made by curdling milk with an acid, such as lemon juice or citric acid. Paneer was predominantly used in most north Indian dishes and is now commonly used throughout India due to its versatility as an ingredient in diverse dishes.\n\n## Etymology\nThe word paneer entered English from the Hindi-Urdu term panīr, which comes from Persian panir (پنیر) 'cheese', which comes from Old Iranian. Armenian panir (պանիր), Azerbaijani pəndir, Bengali ponir (পনির), Turkish peynir and Turkmen peýnir, also Kurdish penîr all derived from Persian panir, also refer to cheese of any type.\n\n## History\nThe origin of paneer is debated. Ancient Indian, Afghan, Iranian and Portuguese origins have been proposed for paneer.\nLegends about Krishna make several references to milk, butter, ghee and dahi (yogurt), but do not mention sour milk cheese. According to Arthur Berriedale Keith, a kind of cheese is \"perhaps referred to\" in Rigveda 6.48.18. However, Otto Schrader (1890) believes that the Rigveda only mentions \"a skin of sour milk, not cheese in the proper sense\". Vedic literature refers to a substance that is interpreted by some authors, such as K. T. Achaya, Om Prakash and Sanjeev Kapoor, as a possible form of paneer, but without definitive evidence.\nCatherine Donnelly, author of The Oxford Companion to Cheese (2016), mentions that Vedic literature refers to cheese production made with the aid of barks of palash tree (Butea monosperma), fruits like jujube (Ziziphus mauritiana) and creeper like putika with coagulating enzymes, \"as well as Dadhanvat, a cheese-like substance made with and without pores\". According to Catherine Donnelly, these plant substances may have contained rennet-like enzymes and notes that the \"Vedas may include some of the earliest known references to rennet-coagulated cheeses\". Lokopakara text dated to the 10th century gives two recipes for coagulated cheeses made from buffalo milk for making sweets using plants and roots. According to the text, buffalo milk was coagulated using roots of amaranth plant or leaves of marsh barbel (Hygrophila auriculata); the soft cheese produced in this manner was called Haluvuga. In the second recipe, buffalo milk was coagulated with Indian mallow (Abutilon indicum) or country mallow (Sida cordifolia) and was made into balls for sweets. Manasollasa, a Sanskrit-language text by the 12th-century king Someshvara III, describes Kshiraprakara, a similar sweet food prepared from milk solids after separating boiled milk using buttermilk.\nAnother theory is that like the word itself, paneer originated in Persianate lands and spread to the Indian subcontinent under Muslim rule. Paneer, according to this theory, was developed and moulded to suit local tastes under these rulers, and the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire are when paneer as currently known developed. Another theory states that paneer is Afghan in origin and spread to India from the lands that make up Afghanistan. National Dairy Research Institute states that paneer was introduced into India by Afghan and Iranian invaders. Based on texts such as Charaka Samhita, BN Mathur wrote that the earliest evidence of a heat-acid coagulated milk product in India can be traced to 75–300 CE, in the Kushan-Satavahana era. Sunil Kumar et al.(2011) interpret this product as the present-day paneer. According to them, paneer is indigenous to the north-western part of South Asia and was introduced in India by Afghan and Iranian travellers.\nAnother theory is that the Portuguese may have introduced the technique of \"breaking\" milk with acid to Bengal in the 17th century. Thus, according to this theory, Indian acid-set cheeses such as paneer and chhena were first prepared in Bengal, under Portuguese influence. A type of smoked cheese called Bandel cheese was introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal, which is distinct from paneer.\n\n## Nutrition and preparation\nPaneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt), to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2–3 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition.\nIn north Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese.\nIn Bengali, Odia and other East Indian cuisines, the chhena are beaten or kneaded by hand into a dough-like consistency, heavily salted and hardened to produce paneer (called ponir), which is typically eaten in slices at teatime with biscuits or various types of bread, deep-fried in a light batter or used in cooking.\nIn the area surrounding the city of Surat in Gujarat, surti paneer is made by draining the curds and ripening them in whey for 12 to 36 hours.\n\n## Use in dishes\nPaneer is the most common type of cheese used in traditional cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. Paneer dishes can be sweet, like shahi paneer, or spicy/hot, like chilli paneer.\n\n### Paneer dishes\nPaneer recipes include:\n\nPaneer pulao (paneer with rice)\nMatar paneer (paneer with peas)\nShahi paneer (paneer cooked in a Mughlai curry)\nPaneer tikka (a vegetarian version of chicken tikka, paneer placed on skewers and roasted)\nPaneer tikka masala\nChilli paneer (an Indo-Chinese preparation with spicy chilies, onions and green peppers, usually served dry and garnished with spring onions)\nKadai paneer (paneer with bell peppers and spices)\nPaneer pakora (paneer fritters)\nPalak paneer (paneer with spinach)\nKhoya paneer (a gravy dish eaten with bread)\nPaneer momo\nPaneer makhani (Paneer with butter, tomatoes and cashews)\nPaneer pasanda (shallow-fried stuffed paneer sandwiches in a smooth, creamy onion-tomato based gravy)\nPaneer lababdar\nPaneer Dopiaza\n\n## Similar cheeses\nAnari, a fresh mild whey cheese produced in Cyprus, is very similar in taste and texture to fresh Indian paneer. Circassian cheese is produced using a similar method and is close in consistency to paneer, but is usually salted. Farmer cheese (pressed curds) and firm versions of quark are similar except that they are made from cultured milk and may be salted. Although many South Asians translate \"paneer\" into \"cottage cheese\", cottage cheese is made using rennet extracted from the stomach of ruminants, and cow's skim milk. Queso blanco or queso fresco are often recommended as substitutes in the Americas and Spain as they are more commercially available in many American markets. Queso blanco can be a closer match, as it is acid-set while queso fresco frequently uses rennet at a lower temperature. Both are generally salted, unlike paneer. It also shares some similarities to queso panela, as well as unsalted halloumi (although it is made using rennet).\n\n## See also\nKalari cheese – Indian traditional ripened cheese\nChhurpi - Himalayan cheese\nShosha (cheese) – Tibetan cheese\nKesong puti – Filipino soft carabao's milk cheese\nCottage cheese – Type of cheese\nKhoa – Indian dairy food\nChhena – Type of cheese curds originating in India\nSurti paneer – Indian soft cheese prepared from buffalo milk\nChura loenpa – Tibetan cheese\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Parsi cuisine\n\nParsi cuisine refers to the traditional cuisine of the Parsi people who had migrated into the Indian subcontinent from Persia, and currently spread across the modern-day South Asian republics of India and Pakistan.\n\n## Primary meals\nThe basic feature of a Parsi lunch is rice, eaten with lentils or a curry. Curry is made with coconut and ras without, with curry usually being thicker than ras. Dinner would be a meat dish, often accompanied by potatoes or other vegetable curry. Kachumbar (a sharp onion-cucumber salad) accompanies most meals.\nPopular Parsi dishes include:\n\nChicken Farcha (Fried chicken appetizer)\nDhansak (Lamb, mutton, goat, chicken or vegetables in a mixed lentil or toor daal gravy served with brown rice)\nPatra ni Machhi  (Fish - Pomfret or Surmai stuffed heavily with green coconut chutney and wrapped in a banana leaf - steam cooked.)\nSali Murghi (Spicy chicken with fine fried matchstick potatoes)\nSaas ni Machhi (Yellow rice with pomfret fish fillets in white sauce)\nKolmi no Patio (Shrimp in spicy tomato curry)\nJardaloo Sali Boti (Boneless mutton in an onion and tomato sauce with apricots and fried matchstick potatoes)\nKhichri (rice with toor daal or moong daal)\nTamota ni Ras Chaval (mutton cutlets with white rice and tomato sauce)\nAlso popular among Parsis, but less so elsewhere, are the typical Parsi eeda (egg) dishes, which include akuri (scrambled eggs with spices) and the pora (\"Parsi\" omelette). Also, vegetables like okra, tomato, potato and others are often cooked with eggs on top.\nTraditional breakfasts during the 1930s in Mumbai or in many South Gujarat villages consisted of khurchan (offal meats cooked with potatoes in a spicy gravy), and some variant of the ubiquitous  deep-fried, fried or half-fried eggs. In agrarian communities, this would be washed down by copious quantities of coconut toddy, often straight off the tree.\nAlthough in the not-so-distant past, vegetables were considered a 'poor peoples food', there is a presently a trend towards light eating, no red-meat and even vegetarianism.\n\n## Desserts\nCommon desserts include sev (vermicelli), ravo (sweet semolina pudding) and malido (a nutty fudge). Also popular are faluda and kulfi, both of which are adoptions from the cuisines of the Irani and Persian-speaking communities. Wedding feasts traditionally include Lagan nu Custard.\n\n## Snacks\nPopular parsi snacks include bhakhra (deep fried sweet dough), batasa (tea biscuits), dar ni pori (sweetened lentils stuffed in a light pastry), doodh na puff (milk froth) and khaman na ladva (dumplings stuffed with sweetened coconut).\n\n## See also\nIrani Cafe\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nKapadia, Rita J.

    "text": "# Pat Chapman (food writer)\n\nPatrick Lawrence Chapman  (20 December 1940 – 22 July 2022) was an English food writer, broadcaster and author, best known for founding The Curry Club. He wrote many books about curries.\n\n## Early life\nChapman was born in London on 20 December 1940. His father was in the Merchant Navy and his mother was a midwifery training sister at Queen Charlotte's Hospital London, and then ran a maternity nursing home in Ealing. He was educated at Bedales School, where he spent time on what the school called \"Outdoor Work\" at the school's farm, working in the piggery and dairy.\nHe took a course at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. He began his career working backstage in London theatres, moving on to stage management at the Belgrade Theatre Coventry. He trained as a jet pilot in the Royal Air Force. He then worked for six years on sales and marketing at Lesney Products, going to night school at Enfield Tech for Business Studies and a Diploma from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. He was then accepted as a mature student at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge reading economics. At the same time he started the stage lighting and sound company, Entec, providing lighting for Cambridge May Balls in 1968, and liquid light shows for BBC Television in 1970 and 1971. During the 1970s, the company provided lighting and sound systems for numerous rock music bands. In 1979, Chapman's investor, the Marquee Club's Harold Pendleton, took over Entec. Chapman moved to Haslemere, Surrey, and spent the next four years as a consultant to entertainment groups on lighting and sound systems.\nChapman inherited a family interest in India, and curry in particular. He visited the subcontinent more than 40 times, and set up the Curry Club.\n\n## Career\nChapman frequently demonstrated curry, held regular curry cookery courses and took small groups of curry enthusiasts to India to visit a region and sample its cuisine. From 2008, Chapman was an active member of the Army Benevolent Fund committee, specifically to help with fund-raising for their annual Big Curry event.\nFor the 2010 National Curry Week celebrations he was commissioned by Cobra Beer to create recipes which add spice to top British Regional favourite dishes.\nFrom 2012 he was a trustee of the Cobra Foundation, an independent charity supported my Molson Coors and Cobra Beer to distribute funds to young people in South Asia by providing health, education, community support.\nChapman appeared on British television many times, including on the shows Who'll Do The Pudding?, This Morning, Food and Drink, Great Food Live and Good Food Live.  He had a regular spot on the Good Morning with Anne and Nick show.\n\n## Awards\nOn 17 November 2019, Chapman was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Asian Curry Awards from the Asian Catering Federation, of which he is the longstanding Chairman of Judges. However, since he was too ill to attend in person, fellow judge George Shaw accepted the award on his behalf saying, \"Everyone who works in the curry sector owes Pat a huge debt and never has a Lifetime Achievement Award so been richly deserved.\"\nOn 22 November 2020 it was planned that Sanjay Anand of Madhu's Caterers and Restaurants would present this Lifetime Achievement Award to Pat Chapman in conjunction with Yawar Khan owner Akash Tandoori Restaurant, Wallington, Surrey and founder The Asian Catering Federation and Awards.\nThe ceremony to present the award was cancelled as restrictions on gatherings were in force due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The award was delivered to Chapman's home.\n\n## Works\nChapman's first cookery book, The Indian Restaurant Cookbook, was published in 1984 and is still in print. Chapman wrote some 36 books, with international sales exceeding 2 million copies. Most are on curry, but some of his other books cover cuisines such as Thai, Chinese, Middle Eastern and International spicy cuisines. His Balti Cookbook was the first on the subject and became a Sunday Times Number 1 bestseller.\n\n### Books\n1984 Curry Club Indian Restaurant Cookbook, Piatkus, London\n1985 Little Curry Book, Piatkus, London\n1986 El Librito del Amante del Curry, Spanish version, pub El Cuerno, Madrid\n1988 Curry Club Favourite Restaurant Curries, Piatkus, London\n2004 Modern Indian Cooking, republished by John Blake\n1989 Sainsbury's Curries, Octopus, London\n1989 Curry Club Chinese Restaurant Cookbook, Piatkus, London\n1989 Curry Club Middle Eastern Cookbook, Piatkus, London\n1990 Curry Club Vegetarian Cookbook, Piatkus, London\n1991 Curry Club 250 Favourite Curries, Piatkus, London\n1993 Curry, Human & Rousseau, South Africa\n1993 Kerrie, in Afrikaans, Human & Rousseau, South Africa\n1993 Curry Club Vindaloo and other Hot Curries, Piatkus, London\n1993 Curry Club 250 Hot and Spicy Dishes, Piatkus, London\n1993 Curry Club Tandoori and Tikka Dishes, Piatkus, London\n1993 Curry Club Balti Curry Cookbook, Piatkus, London\n2006 Modern Balti Curries, republished by John Blake, London\n1994 Sainsbury’s Balti Cookbook, Martin Books, Cambridge\n1994 Curry Club Book of Indian Cuisine, US edition, Prima New York\n1995 Curry Club 100 Favourite Tandoori Recipes, Piatkus, London\n1995 Pat Chapman's Quick and Easy Curries, BBC Books\n1995 Curry Club Quick After Work Curries, Piatkus, London\n1995 Meatless Indian Cooking from the Curry Club, Prima Publications\n1996 Quick After Work Curries, US edition, Fisher, Tucson, Arizona)\n1996 Curry Club Bangladeshi Restaurant Curries, Piatkus, London\n1996 Curries - Masterchef Series, Orion, London\n1996 Pat Chapman's Thai Restaurant Cookbook, Hodder & Stoughton, London\n1997 Pat Chapman's Taste of the Raj, Hodder & Stoughton, London\n1997 Sainsbury's Quick and Easy Stir-fries, Martin Books, Cambridge\n1997 Homestyle Middle Eastern Cooking, Crossing Press, Berkeley, California\n1997 Masterchefs (Compendium volume), Orion, London\n1997 North Indian Curries Classic Cooks, Orion\n1997 Pat Chapman's Curry Bible, Hodder & Stoughton\n1998 Homestyle Indian Cooking, US edition, Crossing Press, Berkeley, California\n1998 Pat Chapman's Balti Bible, Hodder & Stoughton\n1998 Pat Chapman's Noodle Book, Hodder & Stoughton, London\n1998 Classic Cooks (compendium volume), Orion, London\n2000 Pat Chapman's Vegetable Curry Bible, Hodder & Stoughton, London\n2000 Petit Plats Curry, French edition, Hachette Marabout, Paris\n2005 New Curry Bible, republished by John Blake\n2007 India: Food & Cooking, New Holland, London\n\n### Good Curry Guides\nChapman built up a database on Indian restaurants with a team of some 60 reporters who visited restaurants all over Britain.

Paya means 'leg'/'feet' in the Hindi and Urdu languages. The main ingredients of the dish are the trotters (hooves) of a cow, goat, buffalo, or sheep, cooked with various spices.\n\n## Origins\nPaya originated from the amalgamation of South Asian and Central Asian cuisine. The dish was adapted by the cooks of Delhi, Hyderabad of Telangana State, and Lucknow. Bhopal in India then adopted this dish. Bhopal now specializes in this dish, and the cooks of Bhopal are famous for their way of making it.\nSubsequently, paya became popular all over present-day India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Outside of the Indian subcontinent, paya is available in restaurants that serve South Asian cuisine. In Delhi, it is sometimes also referred to as khurode from the word khur meaning foot or hoof. The Hindi word khur is itself derived from Sanskrit khura.\n\n## Recipes\nRecipes for this dish vary regionally. The soup base is created by sautéed onions and garlic, where several curry-based spices are then added to the meat and bones. The cooked dish is served with a garnish of fresh diced ginger and fresh long coriander leaves, along with fresh sliced lemon.\n\n## Cooking methods\nIt is cooked on mild heat for hours (usually overnight) on the stove. However, nowadays it is mostly cooked in a pressure cooker.\nHistorically, when people used wood or coal as a cooking fuel, preparation of this dish would start at night, slowly cooking it in the coals until morning. This dish has a soup-like consistency and is usually eaten as a breakfast food in the winter months with naan.\n\n## Variations\nThere are many variations of this dish. A popular one is siri paya (سری پایا), where siri means the head of an animal. It is considered a delicacy.\n\n## See also\n\nHaleem\nList of stews\nNihari\nPunjabi cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Peranakan cuisine\n\nPeranakan cuisine or Nyonya cuisine comes from the Peranakans, descendants of early Chinese migrants who settled in Penang, Malacca, Singapore and Indonesia, inter-marrying with local Malays. In Baba Malay, a female Peranakan is known as a nonya (also spelled nyonya), and a male Peranakan is known as a baba. The cuisine combines Chinese, Malay, Javanese, South Indian, and other influences.\n\n## Overview\nNyonya cooking is the result of blending Chinese ingredients with various distinct spices and cooking techniques used by the Malay/Indonesian community. This gives rise to Peranakan interpretations of Malay/Indonesian food that is similarly tangy, aromatic, spicy and herbal. In other instances, the Peranakans have adopted Malay cuisine as part of their taste palate, such as assam fish and beef rendang. Key ingredients include coconut milk, galangal (a subtle, mustard-scented rhizome similar to ginger), candlenuts as both a flavoring and thickening agent, laksa leaf, pandan leaves (Pandanus amaryllifolius), belachan, tamarind juice, lemongrass, torch ginger bud, jicama, fragrant kaffir lime leaf, and cincalok – a powerfully flavored, sour and salty shrimp-based condiment that is typically mixed with lime juice, chillies and shallots and eaten with rice and other side dishes.\nThere are regional variations in Nyonya cooking. Dishes from the island of Penang in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia possess Thai influences, such as more liberal use of tamarind and other sour ingredients. Dishes from Singapore and Malacca show a greater Indonesian influence, such as the use of coconut milk. A classic example is laksa (a spicy noodle soup), which comes in two variants: the sour asam laksa from Penang and the coconut milk-based laksa lemak from Singapore and the southern regions of Peninsular Malaysia.\nThe flavor of laksa and other Nonya recipes is determined by the rempah, which in Malay means spices. The various combinations are pounded into a paste with a mortar and pestle, with a very specific texture and density. It is said that a Nyonya can determine the culinary skill of a new daughter-in-law simply by listening to her preparing rempah with a mortar. Nonya recipes are handed down from one generation to the next, and because of the time-consuming preparation of these dishes, it is a cuisine that is often at its best when served at home. Laksa is a notable exception to this rule.\nExamples of Nonya specialities include otak-otak, a popular blend of fish, coconut milk, chilli paste, galangal, and herbs wrapped in a banana leaf; ayam buah keluak, a distinctive dish combining chicken pieces with nuts from the Pangium edule or kepayang tree to produce a rich sauce; and itek tim, a classic soup containing duck, tomatoes, green peppers, salted vegetables, and preserved sour plums simmered gently together.\nNonya desserts include colourful cakes (kue) and sweet, sticky delicacies.\n\n## List of Nyonya dishes\nAchar, various pickled meats and vegetables like achar keat-lah (honey lime/calamansi), achar hu (fried fish), achar kiam hu (salt fish), achar timun (cucumber), achar awat (mixed vegetables).\nApam balik or terang bulan, a bread like puff with sugar, corn, and coarse nut in the middle.\nAsam laksa, a soup noodle dish consisting of a bowl of translucent al dente white rice noodles served in a spicy soup made of fish (usually mackerel), tamarind (both asam jawa and asam gelugor), and daun kesum. Toppings differ considerably, and may include onion, mint, chopped torch ginger flower, and slices of pineapple and cucumber. A dollop of pungent, viscous sweet fermented shrimp paste (petis udang or hae ko) is usually served on the side. This dish is considered one of Penang's three signature dishes.\nAyam buah keluak, a chicken or pork rib stew cooked with the nuts from the kepayang tree (Pangium edule), a mangrove tree that is native to Indonesia, but grown widely in both Indonesia and Malaysia. For this recipe, the contents of the buah keluak is dug out and sauteed with aromatics and seasonings, before it is stuffed back into the nuts and braised with the chicken or pork rib pieces.\nAyam/babi pongteh, a stew of chicken or pork cooked with tauchu or salted fermented soy beans, and gula melaka. It is usually saltish-sweet and can be substituted as a soup dish in Peranakan cuisine. Pork is more commonly used as this is a Peranakan version of the Chinese braised pork belly.\nBabi assam, a pork stew cooked with tamarind juice. This dish is also popular within the Kristang community.\nBak chang, Nyonya-style zongzi made in a similar manner as a typical southern Chinese zongzi. However, the filling is typically minced pork with candied winter melon, ground roasted peanuts, and a spice mix. The blue butterfly pea flower is used to colour the rice with a shade of blue. Originally, Bak chang would be wrapped in dried bamboo leaves, however, the peranakans in Bangka and Belitung islands in Indonesia have been known to use pandan leaves instead, making their bak chang, known locally as nyuk cung, easily recognised. While some other peranakan group in Kalimantan may also use banana leaves.\nBubur cha cha, a Betawi-origin dish made of pearled sago, sweet potatoes, yams, bananas, coconut milk, pandan leaves, sugar and salt. Grated coconut, coconut cream and water can be used as additional ingredients. The ingredients are cooked in coconut milk, and the dish can be served hot or cold.\nCap cai or chap chye, stir-fried vegetables with Chinese Indonesian origin. The Nonya version of this Chinese Indonesian classic incorporates tauchu and dried shrimp.\nChendol, an iced sweet dessert that contains droplets of green rice flour jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar syrup, arguably came from Banjar region in the island of Java.\nCincalok, a distinctly Malay condiment made of fermented tiny shrimp (udang geragau), salt and rice. It is also a favoured cooking ingredient used by the Kristang Eurasian community of Malacca. There are varieties of cincalok can be found along both sides of Malacca strait down to the southern part of Sumatra.\nCincaru, a small fish, deep fried and stuffed with sambal belacan or any other spice.\nEnchi kebin, deep-fried chicken pieces marinated in a paste of coconut milk and rempah (spices).\nItek tim or kiam chhai ak thng, a soup of duck, preserved mustard greens and cabbage flavoured with nutmeg, Chinese mushrooms, tomatoes and peppercorns.\nJiu hu char, a dish made up mainly of shredded vegetables like turnip or jicama, carrot, and cabbage and fried together with thinly shredded dried cuttlefish.\nKari kapitan, a Penang Nonya take on the ubiquitous chicken curry. Kaffir lime leaves and coconut milk are among the key ingredients for this mild curry.\nKerabu bi hun, a salad dish consisting of rice vermicelli mixed with sambal belachan, calamansi lime juice, and finely chopped herbs and spices. Other famous salad dishes are kerabu bok ni (cloud ear fungus/tikus telinga), kerabu ke (chicken), kerabu ke-kha (chicken feet), kerabu timun (cucumber), kerabu kobis (cabbage), kerabu kacang botol (four angled bean), kerabu bak pue (pork skin).\nKiam chhai bue, a mixture of leftovers from Kiam Chhai Ak Thng, Jiu Hu Char, Tu Tɵ́ Thng and various other dishes. \"Bue\" literally means \"end\".\nLaksa lemak, a type of laksa served in a rich coconut gravy, served with prawns, cockles, lime and a dollop of sambal belacan.\nLam mee, long yellow noodles cooked in a rich gravy made from a stock of prawns and chicken. It is always served at birthdays to wish the birthday boy or girl a long life, and thus it is also known as birthday noodles.\nLontong cap go meh, a Peranakan Chinese Indonesian take on the traditional Indonesian dish.\nMasak titik, a style of vegetable soup that makes liberal use of white peppercorns. One version uses watermelon rind as the main ingredient. Another makes use of green or semi ripe papaya.\nMee siam, dish of fried thin rice vermicelli with spicy gravy.\nNasi kunyit, a glutinous rice dish seasoned with turmeric powder, coconut milk and asam gelugor.

Its preparation is the main custom associated with the namesake Pongal festival. Several varieties such as the Venn pongal and Sakkarai pongal are part of the  Tamil cuisine.\n\n## Etymology and significance\nThe dish is associated with the Pongal festival, a major harvest festival of the Tamils. The name literally translates to \"boil over\" or \"overflow\" in Tamil language. As per tradition, the fresh harvest of rice is cooked in boiling milk and offered to various Hindu deities. While the pongal is cooking, onlookers shout \"Pongalo pongal!\" ('Let the pongal rise up!').\n\n## Variations\nTypically pongal varieties are made with cow milk and its derivatives. Venn pongal (\"Venn\" means white) is made up of rice and lentil porridge similar to the another South Asian staple khichdi. Spices like black pepper, ginger, turmeric, asafoetida, cashews, cumin, curry leaves, are used along with ghee (clarified butter), mung beans, and salt. In South India, it is commonly eaten for breakfast with coconut chutney and coffee.\nSakkarai pongal (\"Sakkarai\" meaning sweet or sugar) is made with jaggery, mixed with cardamom, cashews, raisins, nutmeg, and ghee. It is often served as a prasadam after being offered to the deities.

    "text": "# Puffed rice\n\nPuffed rice and popped rice (or pop rice) are types of puffed grain made from rice commonly eaten in the traditional cuisines of Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia. It has also been produced commercially in the West since 1904 and is popular in breakfast cereals and other snack foods. \nTraditional methods to puff or pop rice include frying in oil or salt. Commercial puffed rice is usually made by heating rice kernels under high pressure in the presence of steam, though the method of manufacture varies widely. They are either eaten as loose grains or made into puffed rice cakes.\nCommercial popped rice was developed by American inventor Alexander P. Anderson while he was ascertaining the water content of starch granules.\n\n## Description\nWhile the terms \"puffed rice\" and \"popped rice\" are used interchangeably, they are properly different processes. Puffed rice refers to pre-gelatinized rice grains (either by being parboiled, boiled, or soaked) that are puffed by the rapid expansion of steam upon cooking. Puffed rice retains the shape of the rice grain, but is much larger. Popped rice, on the other hand, refers to rice grains where the hull or the bran is intact. When cooked, the kernel explodes through the hard outer covering due to heating. Popped rice has an irregular shape similar to popcorn. There are various methods, both modern and traditional, for making puffed and popped rice.\n\n## Traditional versions by region\n\n\n### East Asia\nPuffed rice or other grains are occasionally found as street food in China (called \"mixiang\" 米香), Taiwan (called \"bí-phang\" 米芳), Korea (called \"ppeong twigi\" 뻥튀기), and Japan (called \"pon gashi\" ポン菓子), where hawkers implement the puffing process using an integrated pushcart/puffer featuring a rotating steel pressure chamber heated over an open flame. The great booming sound produced by the release of pressure serves as advertising.\n\n### Southeast Asia\n\n\n### South Asia\n\n\n### Rest of the world\n\n\n## Modern commercial production\n\n\n### Puffed rice cereal\nPuffed rice is formed by the reaction of both starch and moisture when heated within the shell of the grain. Unlike corn, rice kernels are naturally lacking in moisture and must first be conditioned with steam. Puffed rice can be created by heating the steam-conditioned kernels either with oil or in an oven. Rice puffed in this way is crisp, and known as \"crisped rice\". Oven-crisped rice is used to produce the Rice Krispies breakfast cereal as well as the crisped rice used in Lion Bars, Nestlé Crunch, Krackel, and similar chocolate bars. Though not as dramatic a change when compared to popcorn, the process and result are the same.\nAnother method of puffing rice is \"gun puffing\", where the grain is conditioned to the correct level of moisture and pressurized to around 200 psi (1,400 kPa). When the pressure is suddenly released, the pressure stored inside the kernel causes it to puff out. This method produces a puffed rice which is spongy in texture.\nRice can also be puffed by making a rice dough, and extruding small pellets which are then rapidly heated. The moisture in the dough flash boils and puffs the rice up. A cereal such as Cap'n Crunch is extruded, cooked, cut, pressurized, puffed and dried in a continuous process.\nThe method of modern industrial puffed rice production is attributed to American inventor Alexander P. Anderson, who stumbled across puffing while trying to ascertain the water content of a single granule of starch. Anderson introduced the first puffing machine at the World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1904. His eight \"guns\" that puffed grains for Fair goers were dubbed \"The Eighth Wonder of the World\" by an advertising billboard poster. Once the puffing principle, technique, and technology had been discovered by Anderson, the competition to puff ready-to-eat American breakfast cereal took over the economy of Battle Creek, Michigan, with Kellogg's and Quaker Oats being two memorable and still active names to endure through the early puffing frenzy.\nIn the United States and Europe, puffed rice is served with milk as a breakfast cereal, a popular brand of this is Rice Krispies. Some chocolate bars, such as the Nestlé Crunch, include puffed rice, and puffed rice cakes are sold as low-calorie snacks.\n\n### Puffed rice cakes\nIn the United States, a flat disk of puffed rice was sold as \"rice cakes\" by the company Chico-San in the 1970s. These rice cakes were marketed as low-calorie \"saucers\" meant to be eaten with toppings like cottage cheese, jelly, and fruit. Chico-San was eventually acquired by Heinz in 1984, at which time the Quaker Oats Company also developed their own rice cake marketed as a \"low-carb alternative to bread\". Rice cakes became a fad diet in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. In 1993, Quaker Oats Company also acquired Chico-San, their biggest competitor, from Heinz. Rice cakes are also produced by other companies including Lundberg Family Farms, Hain Celestial Group, and Whole Foods Market.\nThese puffed rice cakes are typically sold plain or blandly-seasoned, with the most popular flavor being lightly salted. They are also sold in flavored versions, including caramel, chocolate, cinnamon toast. They are popularly disk-shaped, but can also be sold as squares.\nIn the Netherlands, disk-shaped puffed rice cakes are commonly sold in cylindrical packaging in supermarkets. Puffed rice cakes are also sold in a variety of different flavors within Sweden.\n\n## See also\n\nPuffed grain\nFlattened rice\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Punjabi cuisine\n\nPunjabi cuisine is a culinary style originating in the Punjab, a region in South Asia, which is now divided into an Indian part to the east and a Pakistani part to the west. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking.\n\n## History\nThe local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization. Dishes similar to tandoori chicken may have existed during the Harappan civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to the archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been unearthed. Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars which were used for roasting meats and baking breads. Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.\nBasmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it.\n\n## Style of cooking\nThere are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many people still employ the traditional methods and equipment for cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens. Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level. This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi. According to Planalp (1971), \"the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi\" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor. In rural Punjab, it is common to have communal tandoors, which are also called Kath tandoors in Punjabi.\n\n## Staple foods\nPunjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products. These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people. The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy products in India. Therefore, dairy products form an important component of Punjabi diet.\nDairy products are a staple in Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer. Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using the previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. Curd is used as dressing for many raita dishes, to prepare kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (chaas), and as a side dish in a meal. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of lassi. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and ghee (clarified butter).\n\n## Food additives and condiments\nFood additives and condiments are usually added to enhance the flavor of the food. Food coloring is added to sweet dishes and desserts. Starch is used as a bulking agent.\n\n## Common dishes\n\n\n### Breakfast\nBreakfast recipes with respect to different regions within Punjab vary.

Carp, rohu and catfish are the most commonly prepared fish. Other fish types include thela machi and tilapia. Recently, shrimp has been introduced. Fish tikka is an Amritsari speciality.\n\n### Vegetarian\nKhichdi, a grain-and-lentil dish: In the Punjab, khichdi is made of millet flour, mung beans and moth lentils (Vigna aconitifolia). However, khichdi made of rice and red lentils or mung beans is also consumed.\nRajma is the Hindi word for red kidney beans. Beans are cooked in medium spicy onion-tomato gravy and most often served with steamed rice and sometimes with Indian flatbread called chapati (phulka in Punjab region).\nPaneer (freshly made cottage cheese) Recipes like shahi paneer, khoya paneer, paneer kofta (paneer chunks battered and fried, then simmered in a spicy gravy), Amritsari paneer, matar paneer (paneer with green peas), paneer paratha (wheat flatbread stuffed with paneer), palak paneer\nPanjiri: This is a traditional North Indian dessert and is popular in Punjab region as well. which has a generous amount of almonds, walnuts, pistachios, dry dates, cashew nuts along with whole wheat flour, sugar, edible gum, poppy seeds and fennel seeds to make the traditional dish of 'panjri' or also known as 'dabra'.\nChurri: It is made in different flavours salty and sweety but most famous type is mixing crushed wheat chapati, sugar and real cow ghee.\nLegumes: a variety of legumes are used, including chickpeas, pigeon peas, red lentils, mung bean, red kidney beans (originally an import from the Americas) and black gram.

Deep-fried lumps of spiced chickpea-flour batter (pakoras) are also added.\nPunjabi lassi paneer: In the Punjab, it is traditional to prepare lassi and then extract the paneer which would then be consumed by adding water, salt and chili. Lassi paneer can also be added to potatoes and spices to make a curry which resembles scrambled eggs. Lassi paneer cannot be cut into cubes as paneer from milk can be.\n\n### Snacks\nToasted grains: In Punjab, toasting corn and wheat grains on the Punjabi bhathi is a traditional snack preparation.\nSamosas\nGolgappa\n\n### Raita and chutney\nAlong with all types of main dishes raita or chutney is also served.\n\n## Sweets and desserts\nPunjabi cuisine includes various types of desserts and Mithyai which include:\n\nAmritsari\nKheer, dessert made of rice, milk and dry fruits\nKhoya\nKulfi, an ice-cream-like dessert\nMalpua\nRabri\nSemolina-based desserts: Halva\nSheer korma\nKaju katli\nAtte ka halwa (Kadah)\nPude – usually made during the rainy season\nPinni – Made with desi ghee, wheat flour, almond and jaggery\nGulab jamun\nJalebi\nBurfi.\nGajrela \nSuwaiah-a sweet milk based desert with a special type of pasta\n\n## Bread\nPunjabis eat a variety of breads.

The breads may be made of different types of flour and can be made in various ways:\n\nBaked in the tandoor like naan, tandoori roti, kulcha, or lachha paratha\nDry baked (Indian griddle), jowar di roti, baajre di roti and makki di roti (these are also smeared with white butter)\nShallow fried like paratha\nDeep fried like puri, Kachori and bhatoora (a fermented dough)\nSalt-rising bread: Salt-rising bread is a unique bread found only in the Salt Range region of Punjab, Pakistan. Since rock salt is readily available in the salt range, many people in the past made use of salt instead of yeast to leaven the bread.\nPapar\nTaftan: an Iranian bread popular in Pakistan and Lahore. It can be eaten with korma and nihari.\n\n## Herbs and spices\nIndian subcontinent-based spices are used in Punjabi cuisine, which are ground in a mortar and pestle or a food processor.\n\n## Beverages\nPunjab has a diverse range of beverages. Some are dairy-based such as lassi and buttermilk. Water buffalo milk-based products are especially common around Punjab. Examples are mango lassi, mango milkshake, and chaas. Others are juices derived from vegetables and fruits, such as watermelon shakes, carrot juice and tamarind juice (imli ka paani). Shikanjvi and neembu paani drinks are especially preferred during the summer. Jal-jeera is also common as well.\nSattu is a traditional North Indian drink that is also traditionally consumed in the Punjab. Sattu is made by roasting barley grains and then grinding them into powder, mixed with salt and turmeric and water.\nThe local regional drinks in Punjab also include Doodh soda (milk soda), Desi Daaru (a local form of alcohol in India) and Bantay (a local soda drink) in Pakistan.\n\n## Fermented foods\nFermented foods are common in Punjabi cuisine. Also fermented foods are added in the preparation of some dishes as well. Mango pickle is especially famous in many villages of Punjab.\n\n## Cooking methods\nTraditional and modern methods are employed for cooking Punjabi cuisine. The traditional stoves and ovens used to cook Punjabi food include:\n\n### Chullah\nThe traditional name of the stove in the Punjabi language is chulla. Traditional houses also have ovens (wadda chulla or band chulla) that are made from bricks, stones, and in many cases clay. Older communities in Punjab also used earth ovens (khadda chulla), but this tradition is dying out now.\n\n### Bhathi\nA masonry oven is known as a bhathi. Outdoor cooking and grilling have many different types of bhathi. A bhathi is used to roast wheat or corn for which Kalsi (1992) describes as a \"special oven with an open pan in which sand is heated to roast corn.\"\n\n### Hara\nA hara is a six-foot-tall oven with its own roof. The hara is traditionally used to slow-heat milk or slow-cook pulses such as chickpeas.\n\n### Tandoor\nAccording to Ancient Pakistan - An Archaeological History by Mukhtar Ahmed, Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. The tandoor is traditionally made of clay and is a bell-shaped oven, set into the earth and fired with wood or charcoal reaching high temperatures. According to Roy Hayter the original versions of the tandoor \"in the Punjab, a province in the north-west of India, were sunk neck deep in the ground\". He further states that modern versions can also rest above the ground.\n\n### Modern methods\nPressure cookers\nIron griddle\n\n## Etiquette of Punjabi dining\nEtiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette. The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab. Communal dining is a norm in Punjabi families.\nBringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the spring season. Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality. Mango is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, and mango parties are common during the fruit's harvest season. Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives.\n\n### Major features of etiquette\nAn invitation to a meal or tea is typically distributed few days beforehand. Denying the invitation for no major reason is considered a breach of etiquette.\nTable setting is done before the arrival of the guests.\nFamily members or any occupants within one home make sure to eat together during the dinner. If any other person is present in the vicinity, then they are offered meals as a way of giving respect. It is considered rude to start eating food without asking others to participate in a meal. It is customary to offer food to anyone in your vicinity before eating. The invited guest or elder person is given special respect and attention. Usually the invited guest is requested to start the meal. It is considered rude if the host starts eating without taking into account the attendance of all guests.\nPunjabi families use a hybrid style of South Asian and European utensil etiquette most of the time. The bread and rice are eaten with the hands. Desserts are eaten with spoons. Soup spoons are used for consuming soup and forks are used for eating noodles. Chewing food with one's mouth open and burping in front of others is considered rude. In the villages of Punjab, an additional common plate is usually placed on the table for any bones left from the consumption of bone meat. Placing leftovers on the floor or on the table floor is considered bad etiquette.\n\n## Punjabi dhaba\nThe roadsides often serve as suburban eatery centers. They can also be a communal place to sit and chat. Some serve on the same concept of the greasy spoon.\n\n## Punjabi restaurants\nPunjabi cuisine has spread internationally. Punjab in London has been family-run since 1946 and is the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant. The New Punjab Club, located in Hong Kong, became the world's first Punjabi restaurant to earn one Michelin star in 2019.\n\n## See also\nIndian cuisine\nLahori cuisine\nPakistani cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Cuisine of Punjab, India at Wikimedia Commons",

Puri is often served on holidays and other events. It is also served as in Hindu prayer as prasadam, offerings to deities.\n\n## Name\nThe word puri, or poori, entered English from Hindi (पूरी). It originates from the Sanskrit word पूर (pura), meaning either 'cake' or 'blown up'. The Sanskrit word purika described a fried gram flour food more similar to modern papri than puri.\n\n## Preparation\nPuris are flatbreads prepared with wheat flour along with either oil or ghee, enough water to form a stiff dough, and a small amount of salt. The proportions are approximately 48% water, 2%–8% oil, and 0.5%–1.5% salt. The flour is commonly atta (whole wheat). Maida (white flour) is used in some regions, though its use is often viewed as inferior. After kneading and resting, the dough is shaped into balls, about 2 to 3 cm across, typically cut from a cylinder. These are rolled out in circles, about 10 to 17 cm across and 1 to 3 mm thick. This may also be done using a chapati press or using a dough sheeting machine that may produce thousands of puris per hour. The oil content facilitates the rolling of the dough, preventing stickiness.\n\nThe circles of dough are deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil in a karahi, a type of pot whose rounded shape uses less oil and avoids spillage. Common frying oils include rice bran oil and soybean oil. The dough is fried for about 30–40 seconds at about 200–220 °C (390–430 °F) or for 60–180 seconds at 180–190 °C (360–370 °F). The cooking time depends on volume, thickness, and the amount of moisture and oil. While deep frying, puris puff up because moisture in the dough changes into steam, expanding to ten times the initial volume. As steam forms, a puri floats to the top of the oil, causing it to cook on one side at a time. This requires it to be flipped, and it is often pushed down to be coated in oil. The steam pushes the crust away from the crumb and results in partial starch gelatinisation between the layers, which is high due to the high temperature. Puri has a much denser crumb than yeast breads.\nPuri is cooked until browned, and the oil is drained. It is served hot. The texture is soft due to the oil. Madhur Jaffrey writes, \"it takes years of practice to make really fine, soft pooris. It is said in Benares that if twenty five pooris were stacked on a plate and a coin dropped on the lot, the sound of the coin hitting the plate should be heard with clarity.\" If stored at room temperature, puri lasts a few days but becomes less soft.\nPuri is categorised as a single-layer, unleavened flatbread. It resembles chapati in its ingredients and shape, but puri is fried and puffy, whereas chapati and phulka are toasted over a flame. A bread similar to puri, popular in Bengali cuisine, is luchi, which is made using white flour and deep fried. Another similar bread is bhatura, which is made with yeast and yoghurt in the dough, while puri is made from unleavened dough. Kachori, commonly described as a stuffed puri, typically uses a filling of pulses and does not inflate as much as puri.\n\n## Serving\nPuri may be a breakfast, a light meal, or a snack. Like other Indian breads, puri is usually eaten with other foods, though it may be eaten on its own. It may be eaten with sweet or savoury foods.\nThe most common accompaniments are curries of chickpeas or potatoes. Puri served with potato curry comprises the North Indian breakfast puri-bhaji. A Punjabi breakfast may pair puri with both potato and chickpea curries. Another potato curry served with puri is the Gujarati and Parsi dish papeta nu saakh. The chickpea curry chana masala, a common street food, is served with puri. Other savory accompaniments include pickle or fried vegetables.\nSweets that are commonly served with puri include the East Indian pua and the Western Indian shrikhand, doodhpak, and aamras. The sweet jalebi is often eaten alongside puri for breakfast, served with halwa in North India. The Tamil sweet pal payasam consists of puri dipped in kheer.\n\n## Nutrition and chemistry\nA typical Bangladeshi puri, which is made of 50 grams of atta and 5 grams of oil, contains 219 calories. Due to being deep fried, puri contains more fat than other South Asian flatbreads, which makes it high in calories. The fat content is between 21% and 24%, or sometimes up to 30%, including about 7.6% of trans fats, while the moisture content is about 20%–23%. Puri has a protein content of about 12% and a starch content of about 40%, including a high level of insoluble dietary fibre. One puri contains about 300 milligrams of sodium.\nCompared to chapati, puri is low in minerals, though this may be increased using fortifications such as amaranth. Though the flour used in puri contains vitamins, the cooking process results in a loss of 50% of folate and 40% of other vitamins, including riboflavin and niacin. Loss of water as steam results in significant loss of vitamin B12 and fast degradation of vitamin D3.\n\nPuris may vary in size, method, and oil uptake. Oil uptake is high in puris, and it is higher in puris with lower water content. As puri floats to the top of the frying oil, it absorbs less oil than foods that are fully immersed while frying (as with a deep fryer). Puri is often cooked at a temperature above the smoke point of the oil, resulting in the formation of contaminants such as 4-Hydroxynonenal and acrolein. It is also common for the oil to be reused, causing buildup of such contaminants and further lowering the smoke point. More moisture is lost in white-flour puris than wheat-flour puris, the latter containing more fibre. Finer grains and more damaged starch are also correlated with higher water content.\nThe colour, flavour, and scent of puri are a result of the Maillard reaction during cooking. Compared to chapati, puri undergoes a faster Maillard reaction, and it contains a higher level of acrylamides, a potentially hazardous compound found in cooked food. According to Mehrajfatema Z. Mulla et al., the Maillard reaction does not fully account for the level of acrylamides, which may partly result from lipid oxidation. The flour milling method influences this process as higher levels of acrylamide are correlated with higher levels of reducing sugar, more damaged starch, and finer grains.\nQualities desired by consumers of puri include moist texture, pliability, tearability, height, and yellow colour. According to Veeranna Hitlamani and Aashitosh Ashok Inamdar, flour milled using a chakki produces the optimal qualities. Multiple types of flour may be combined to result in lower-fat puri; a study by S. R. Shurpalekar and V. K. Shukla found that using composite flours, particularly gram flour, results in acceptable puris. The addition of a hydrocolloid may increase moisture retention in puri dough; for one, a study by M. L. Sudha and G. Venkateshwara Rao found that hydroxypropyl methylcellulose results improves this as well as textural qualities. A study by K. R. Parimala and M. L. Sudha found that adding guar gum increases water retention and decreased oil uptake. According to studies led by Sukumar Debnath, the type of oil used for frying and the number of times it is reused do not change sensory qualities.\n\n## History\nAccording to chef Manjit Gill, puri has existed since the Vedic period. Historian K. T. Achaya notes the existence of cave paintings depicting the preparation of round dough, identified as puri or chapati. During the late Buddhist era, a food called gulalalāvaniya was recorded, which Achaya describes as a small, round puri that may have had both sweet and salty varieties. A recipe for puri is in the fifteenth-century cookbook Ni’matnama.\nHindus in the Mughal Empire consumed puri and bhatura with vegetable dishes such as saag, but these breads were not adopted by the Muslim population. The sixteenth-century epic Padmavat lists puri as one of the foods served by the titular queen at an elaborate dinner. The cookbook Khulasat-i Makulat u Mashrubat, written during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, includes a recipe for puri.\nIn 19th-century British India, North Indian snack foods such as puri were eaten as tiffin snacks as part of an early form of Indian fast food. Puri and other flour-based foods became part of the cuisine of the Malabar Coast in the first half of the 20th century, when the region faced a famine and introduced wheat imports from the United States.\n\n## Consumption\nPuri is from the northern part of South Asia. It is consumed in countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, as well as in Maritime Southeast Asia. It is the second-most consumed flatbread in South Asia, behind chapati, and is a staple food in much of the region. Like chapati and paratha, it is often homemade. It is sometimes packed to eat while travelling.\nAccording to the 2005 Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 28.5% of the country's households consume puri. It is a popular snack from street food vendors in the country. In the South Indian region of Coastal Andhra, puri is served with potato curry or chutney as breakfast, but is less common than South Indian idli or dosa. In the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, puri may be served alongside rice as part of a dham feast. Puri is known in Burmese cuisine as a food served at tea shops. It is also commonly eaten by the Indian-Ugandan community of Kampala.\nPuri is a common feature of Hindu festivals. In North Indian Hindu traditions, it is classified as pukka, a type of food that is made with ghee, which is associated with purity, and is served when hosting guests or during festivals. In North India and West India, puri is served with sweets during Diwali. In Odisha, a large puri is made during Bali Yatra, which is called thunka puri. Additionally, members of the Bene Israel community of Jews in India eat puri on Purim. Puri is also eaten at weddings across India. It is eaten with halwa at Sikh funerals.\nPuris are commonly given as prasada offered to Hindu deities in North India. Sweet puris are also used as prasada. In the folk religion of the Jad people of the Himalayas, puri is offered to certain deities who do not receive animal sacrifices, including Rengali.\n\n## Types and variants\nThere are many variants of puri.\n\n### Stuffed puris\nIn stuffed puri variants, the dough is rolled out, folded over a filling of vegetables and spices, then rolled out again. Puri stuffed with potatoes, or aloo puri, is a typical breakfast in India. Masala puri is stuffed with spices and vegetables such as potatoes. In South Indian cuisine, puris may use a mashed potato filling also used for dosa. Puris in Bihari cuisine are stuffed with sattu, a chickpea product. Another variant, largely popular in North India, is called bedmi (or bedai) puri. It is prepared using a stuffing of urad dal or moong dal paste. The dish known as paratha in the Paranthe Wali Gali area of Delhi is more similar to a stuffed puri or bedmi than a typical paratha.\nSome versions of puri are sweet. Gujhia is a sweet puri stuffed with milk, wheat, coconut, and nuts, and folded into a crescent. Puran puri has a sweet stuffing with lentils, cardamom, and saffron. Puri dough is also used for a Gujarati cookie called ghari, made with khoa and nuts.\n\n### Dough variations\nThe type of flour used in puri may vary. In regions where wheat is not common, wheat flour is mixed with local maize flour, jowar, or gram flour. Puri may also be made of millet flour. As some Hindu observances involve abstaining from typical grains, adherents of these fasts may make puri using amaranth grain.\nKadak puri is made with a mixture of whole wheat flour and gram flour, as well as turmeric and chili powder. In the cuisine of Chhattisgarh, a type of puri called chausela is made of rice flour. In Kerala cuisine, rice flour and coconut are used to make a type of puri called nai-patthiri, eaten for breakfast. In Madhya Pradeshi cuisine, thedula is a puri made of wheat, gram, and spices. In the cuisine of the Malabar Muslims, a puri called nei pathiri, served on special occasions, has a dough of ground rice, coconut, and anise. In the cuisine of Delhi, nagori is a sweet puri made of wheat and semolina.\nIn some recipes, purées of spinach, tomatoes, carrots, or legumes are added to the dough. A type of puri from Chhattisgarh uses a dough with wheat flour, rice flour, and leaf vegetables. In some rural parts of North India, sweet puris are made of a dough with wheat flour and the flowers of the mahura trees.\n\n### Puri-based chaats\nMany types of chaat that are served as street food consist of puri mixed with other ingredients. Unlike the typical version, the puris used for panipuri are a few centimetres across and very round, and they have a hard texture due to using less water. They are sometimes made crisper by the use of semolina in the dough. Panipuris have a filling that may include chutney, potatoes, and chickpeas; different ingredients are used for regional variants such as golgappa and phuchka. Sev puri is another chaat dish, similarly consisting of a small puri shell with a filling. Flat puris—papris—also have a hard texture; these are used in other chaats such as bhel puri and papri chaat. In papri chaat, flat puris are topped with other ingredients. In bhel puri, they are combined with onions, puffed rice, and fried lentils. Bhel puri is one of the most popular snacks served by street vendors in Mumbai.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n### Works cited\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Rajasthani cuisine\n\nRajasthani cuisine is the traditional cuisine of the Rajasthan state in north-west India. It was influenced by various factors like the warlike lifestyles of its inhabitants, the availability of ingredients in an arid region, and by Hindu temple traditions of sampradayas like Pushtimarg and Ramanandi.

The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Brahmins, Jains, Bishnois and others preferred a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies.\nAccording to a 2014 survey released by the registrar general of India, Rajasthan has 74.9% vegetarians, which makes it the most vegetarian state in India.\n\n## Rajwaadi culinary tradition\nRajasthan is known for its Royal Rajwaadi cuisine (also known as Raajsi cuisine) which emanated from the culinary traditions of Royal courts and temples.\nThe Rajwaadi cuisine is characterized by high usage of dry fruits & milk products like Yogurt for preparing rich gravies, ghee & butter for cooking & frying, mawa & chhena for sweets, usage of Kesar, kewda water & rose water and whole spices like jayaphal, javitri, cardamom etc. for flavoring and aroma.\nOften Rajwaadi food items are decorated with thin foils of gold & silver and also served in golden or silver \ncrockery.\n\n## Rajput cuisine\nRajasthani cuisine is also influenced by the Rajputs, who traditionally consume sacrificial meat only. Their diet consisted of game meat which is procured only via Jhatka method. Some of the non vegetarian lamb dishes like Ratto Maans (meat in red gravy), Dhaulo Maans (meat in white gravy) and Jungli maans (game meat cooked with basic ingredients). Another popular non vegetarian dish from Rajasthan is Maans ra Soola, which is a kind of spitted or skewered meat. Another dish is Sohita or Soyeta, delectably made from chicken, millets, ginger and chilli.\nApart from lamb, chicken and freshwater fish are also cooked; for example Bhuna Kukada and Macchli Jaisamandi. Another royal non vegetarian recipe is Khadd Khargosh or Khadd Susalyo is a curried rabbit dish, based on a traditional Indian hunter dish common in the days of the Rajput kings, where the rabbits would be wrapped in leaves and baked in a freshly dug pit which acted as an oven. Mokal is another non vegetarian dish which is prepared from rabbit meat cooked with lemon, almond and nutmeg.\n\n## Rajasthani barbecue techniques\nRajasthani cooking employs use of Barbecue, grilling and baking techniques for preparing an array of foods.  Various cooking equipments are used in Rajasthani culinary tradition for this purpose. Every household has its own grill locally known by the name Sigdi (Sanskrit: शकटी, Śakṭī) or Angithi (Sanskrit: अग्निस्थिका, Agnisthikā). Clay ovens called bhatthi or tandoor are also very common. In fact, these clay ovens i.e. Bhatthi (Sanskrit: भ्राष्ट्र Bhrāshtra) or tandoor originated in Rajasthan. Indus Valley site : Kalibangan in Rajasthan has the earliest archaeological evidence of using clay ovens resembling present day tandoors. These Sigdis/Angithis/Bhatthis or tandoors would then be used for baking breads like Baati, Angakadi, Baphla, Angarki roti, Kinwani roti (fermented flour roti). Often Soolas of maans (meat), macchli (fish) & chhena (cottage cheese) were barbecued using skewers in these clay oven. Khadd ka Pind is yet another barbecue technique employed by Rajasthan royal princes while their hunting expeditions.\n\n## Breads\nSince Rajasthan is mostly an arid state, wheat and millets form the staple diet instead of rice (which are common in rest of India).\nVarious breads are prepared from wheat like tawa roti, Angarki/Tandoori roti, Kinwani roti (naturally fermented flour roti) etc. Khoba Roti is a special roti from Rajasthan which is prepared by pinching the dough to make a beautiful pattern of indentations on roti. It is very common to prepare large sized rotis called Rotlas/Bhakri using flour of millets like Bajra (Pearl millet), Makai (Maize), Jowar etc.\nGram flour is usually mixed with wheat flour to prepare missi atta which is then used to prepare Missi Roti. Sometimes, multigrain flatbread called Bejad Roti is prepared by mixing wheat flour with jowar flour and besan. Tikkad is another typical Rajasthani bread which is prepared by blend of flours and vegetables. Kanda Tamatar Tikkad and Bajra Mooli Tikkad are some common variations of Tikkad.\nDeep fried breads include: puris & kachauris (stuffed with dal pithi, vegetables, mawa etc.). Kanda Kachauri, prepared using stuffing of onion based mixture is a speciality of Rajasthani cuisine. Mawa Kachauri is sweet version of Kachauri stuffed with mawa.

In this tradition, the temple deity is offered royally embellished food and sweets rich in dry fruits and milk products. These embellished sweets were then distributed amongst common people and devotees visiting the temple.

In South Indian households rasam commonly refers to a soupy dish prepared with a sweet-sour stock made from either kokum or tamarind, along with tomato and lentil, added spices and garnish.\nThe name rasam is derived from Sanskrit रस; transliterated: rása, meaning sap, juice, or essence. The Sanskrit word also yielded the English word rasa, in the aesthetic sense.\n\n## Ingredients\nRasam is prepared mainly with a tart base such as kokum, malabar tamarind (kudam puli), tamarind, vate huli (vate huli powder), ambula or amchur (dried green mango) stock depending on the region. A dal or lentil stock (for rasam, the typical dal used is split yellow pigeon peas or mung beans) is optional but is used in several rasam recipes. Jaggery, cumin, black pepper, turmeric, tomato, lemon, mustard seeds, chilli powder, curry leaves, garlic, shallots and coriander leaves may be used as flavoring ingredients and garnish in South India.\n\n## Types\nDifferent kinds of rasam are listed below with their main ingredients.\n\n## See also\nList of soups\n\n\n== References ==",

In Manipur and northeastern India, rice cultivation rites form an important part in the life of the farmer. The largest harvest festivals in the country are inextricably linked to the time when rice is harvested; invariably held during mid-January. These festivals are Bihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu,  Makara Sankranti in Karnataka and in the northern and the western states of India.\n\n## History\nRice is a sacred grain in India. The Atharvaveda defines rice as the \"sons of heaven who never die\". According to the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, the god of rice is called Annadevata, the ancestor of the sacrifice, and also admonishes people to not decry the role of rice. Shatapatha Brahmana says rice emerged from the body of Indra, and further elaborates: \"[f]rom his marrow his drink, the soma juice flowed, and became rice: in this way his energies, or vital power, went from  him\". Archaeological findings indicate that rice was first cultivated in the region around Kashi.\n\n## Religious uses\nRice grains are used in the form of blessings known as akshata. Dry rice is smeared with red vermilion and  applied on the forehead of persons as it is said to bestow favourable characteristics. It is one of the navadanya, the nine sacred grains used in sacred ceremonies. During Hindu religious ceremonies, another use of rice is as a 'havis' offering of cooked rice to the sacrificial fire in the yajña kuṇḍa, propitiating gods. Rice smeared with turmeric powder is sprinkled over worshippers and the newly married couple as a blessing. Only rice can form the base called asanam (seat) for placing the sacred kalasha (pot) upon it during religious celebrations. In certain regions of India, the bride and bridegroom stand on a heap of rice during the marriage ceremony.\nIn funeral rites of diverse forms, dry rice or sodden rice is placed at or near the mouth of the corpse by all relatives of the dead person, which is a rite generally done before taking the body to the crematorium. Cooked rice in white colour is also used to denote a pure soul.\n\n## Festivals\n\nFestivals are linked to pre-sowing, sowing, pre-transplanting, transplanting, invoking the rain gods, protecting and pre-harvesting. Pongal was the biggest and still the most celebrated festival in India. On the day of Makara Sankranthi, cows and bullocks are washed and beautifully decorated, clothed, horns painted, decked with flowers and fed with Pongal recognising their total involvement in the agricultural process of giving milk and tilling the land.\nIn Coorg district in Karnataka, a festival called the Huttari festival with 'pudda ari' (transl. new rice) is celebrated during the rice harvest season, during January, with great fervour. There is no Brahmin interference at the time as the celebration which held for a number of days after tasting fresh rice includes consumption of brandy and pork, widely as part of the celebrations.\n\n\n== References ==",

Predictions of how rice yields will be affected by climate change vary across geographies and socioeconomic contexts. In human culture, rice plays a role in various religions and traditions, such as in weddings.\n\n## Description\nThe rice plant can grow to over 1 m (3 ft) tall; if in deep water, it can reach a length of 5 m (16 ft). From seed to harvest, it takes about six months. A single plant may have several leafy stems or tillers. The upright stem is jointed with nodes along its length; a long slender leaf arises from each node. The self-fertile flowers are produced in a panicle, a branched inflorescence which arises from the last internode on the stem. There can be up to 350 spikelets in a panicle, each containing male and female flower parts (anthers and ovule). A fertilised ovule develops into the edible grain or caryopsis.\nRice is a cereal belonging to the family Poaceae. As a tropical crop, it can be grown during the two distinct seasons (dry and wet) of the year provided that sufficient water is made available. It is normally an annual, but in the tropics it can survive as a perennial, producing a ratoon crop.\n\n## Agronomy\n\n\n### Growing\nLike all crops, rice depends for its growth on both biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The principal biotic factors are crop variety, pests, and plant diseases. Abiotic factors include the soil type, whether lowland or upland, amount of rain or irrigation water, temperature, day length, and intensity of sunlight.\nRice grains can be planted directly into the field where they will grow, or seedlings can be grown in a seedbed and transplanted into the field. Direct seeding needs some 60 to 80 kg of grain per hectare, while transplanting needs less, around 40 kg per hectare, but requires far more labour. Most rice in Asia is transplanted by hand. Mechanical transplanting takes less time but requires a carefully prepared field and seedlings raised on mats or in trays to fit the machine. Rice does not thrive if continuously submerged. Rice can be grown in different environments, depending upon water availability. The usual arrangement is for lowland fields to be surrounded by bunds and flooded to a depth of a few centimetres until around a week before harvest time; this requires a large amount of water. The \"alternate wetting and drying\" technique uses less water. One form of this is to flood the field to a depth of 5 cm (2 in), then to let the water level drop to 15 cm (6 in) below surface level, as measured by looking into a perforated field water tube sunk into the soil, and then repeating the cycle. Deepwater rice varieties tolerate flooding to a depth of over 50 centimetres for at least a month. Upland rice is grown without flooding, in hilly or mountainous regions; it is rainfed like wheat or maize.\n\n### Harvesting\nAcross Asia, unmilled rice or \"paddy\" (Malay padi), was traditionally the product of smallholder agriculture, with manual harvesting. Larger farms make use of machines such as combine harvesters to reduce the input of labour. The grain is ready to harvest when the moisture content is 20–25%. Harvesting involves reaping, stacking the cut stalks, threshing to separate the grain, and cleaning by winnowing or screening. The rice grain is dried as soon as possible to bring the moisture content down to a level that is safe from mould fungi. Traditional drying relies on the heat of the sun, with the grain spread out on mats or on pavements.\n\n## Evolution\n\n\n### Phylogeny\nThe edible rice species are members of the BOP clade within the grass family, the Poaceae. The rice subfamily, Oryzoideae, is sister to the bamboos, Bambusoideae, and the cereal subfamily Pooideae. The rice genus Oryza is one of eleven in the Oryzeae; it is sister to the Phyllorachideae. The edible rice species O. sativa and O. glaberrima are among some 300 species or subspecies in the genus.\n\n### History\nOryza sativa rice was first domesticated in China 9,000 years ago, by people of Neolithic cultures in the Upper and Lower Yangtze, associated with Hmong–Mien speakers and pre-Austronesians, respectively. The functional allele for nonshattering, the critical indicator of domestication in grains, as well as five other single-nucleotide polymorphisms, is identical in both indica and japonica. This implies a single domestication event for O. sativa. Both indica and japonica forms of Asian rice sprang from a single domestication event in China from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon. Despite this evidence, it appears that indica rice arose when japonica arrived in India about 4,500 years ago and hybridised with another rice, whether an undomesticated proto-indica or wild O. nivara.\nRice was introduced early into Sino-Tibetan cultures in northern China by around 6000 to 5600 years ago, and to the Korean peninsula and Japan by around 5500 to 3200 years ago. It was also carried into Taiwan by the Dapenkeng culture by 5500 to 4000 years ago, before spreading southwards via the Austronesian migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and Guam, but did not survive the voyage to the rest of the Pacific. It reached Austroasiatic and Kra-Dai speakers in Mainland Southeast Asia and southern China by 5000 years ago.\nRice spread around the rest of the world through cultivation, migration and trade, eventually to the Americas as part of the Columbian exchange after 1492. The now less common Oryza glaberrima (African rice) was independently domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago, and introduced to the Americas by the Spanish. In British North America by the time of the start of the American War of Independence, rice had become the fourth most valuable export commodity behind only tobacco, wheat, and fish.\n\n## Commerce\n\n\n### Production\nIn 2023, world production of rice was 800 million tonnes, led by China and India with a combined 52% of the total. This placed rice third in the list of crops by production, after sugarcane and maize. Other major producers were Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. 90% of world production is from Asia.\n\n### Yield records\nThe average world yield for rice was 4.7 metric tons per hectare (2.1 short tons per acre), in 2022. Yuan Longping of China's National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center set a world record for rice yield in 1999 at 17.1 metric tons per hectare (7.6 short tons per acre) on a demonstration plot. This employed specially developed hybrid rice and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), an innovation in rice farming.\n\n### Food security\nRice is a major food staple in Asia, Latin America, and some parts of Africa, feeding over half the world's population. However, a substantial part of the crop can be lost post-harvest through inefficient transportation, storage, and milling. A quarter of the crop in Nigeria is lost after harvest. Storage losses include damage by mould fungi if the rice is not dried sufficiently. In China, losses in modern metal silos were just 0.2%, compared to 7–13% when rice was stored by rural households.\n\n### Processing\nThe dry grain is milled to remove the outer layers, namely the husk and bran. These can be removed in a single step, in two steps, or as in commercial milling in a multi-step process of cleaning, dehusking, separation, polishing, grading, and weighing. Brown rice only has the inedible husk removed. Further milling removes bran and the germ to create successively whiter products. Parboiled rice is subjected to a steaming process before it is milled. This makes the grain harder, and moves some of the grain's vitamins and minerals into the white part of the rice so these are retained after milling.\n\n### Trade\nWorld trade figures are much smaller than those for production, as less than 8% of rice produced is traded internationally. China, an exporter of rice in the early 2000s, had become the world's largest importer of rice by 2013. Developing countries are the main players in the world rice trade; by 2012, India was the largest exporter of rice, with Thailand and Vietnam the other largest exporters.\n\n### Worldwide consumption\nAs of 2016, the countries that consumed the most rice were China (29% of total), India, and Indonesia. By 2020, Bangladesh had taken third place from Indonesia. On an annual average from 2020 to 2023, China consumed 154 million tonnes of rice, India consumed 109 million tonnes, and Bangladesh and Indonesia consumed about 36 million tonnes each. Across the world, rice consumption per capita fell in the 21st century as people in Asia and elsewhere ate less grain and more meat. An exception is Sub-Saharan Africa, where both per capita consumption of rice and population are increasing.\n\n## Food\n\n\n### Eating qualities\nRice is a commonly-eaten food around the world. The varieties of rice are typically classified as short-, medium-, and long-grained. Oryza sativa indica varieties are usually long-grained; Oryza sativa japonica varieties are usually short- or medium-grained. Short-grain rice, with the exception of Spanish Bomba, is usually sticky when cooked, and is suitable for puddings. Thai Jasmine rice is aromatic, and unusually for a long-grain rice has some stickiness, with a soft texture. Indian Basmati rice is very long-grained and aromatic. Italian Arborio rice, used for risotto, is of medium length, oval, and quite sticky. Japanese sushi rice is a sticky short-grain variety.\n\n### Nutrition\nCooked white rice is 69% water, 29% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference serving of 100 grams (3.5 oz), cooked white rice provides 130 calories of food energy, and contains moderate levels of manganese (18% DV), with no other micronutrients in significant content (all less than 10% of the Daily Value).\nIn 2018, the World Health Organization strongly recommended fortifying rice with iron, and conditionally recommended fortifying it with vitamin A and with folic acid.\nRice does not contain gluten, so is suitable for people on a gluten-free diet. Rice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a complete protein as it does not contain all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts for good health.\n\n### Golden rice\nGolden rice is a variety produced through genetic engineering to synthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the endosperm of the rice grain. It is intended to be grown and eaten in parts of the world where Vitamin A deficiency is prevalent. Golden rice has been opposed by anti-GMO activists, such as in the Philippines. In 2016 more than 100 Nobel laureates encouraged the use of genetically modified organisms, such as golden rice, for the benefits these could bring.\n\n## Rice and climate change\n\n\n### Greenhouse gases from rice production\nIn 2022, greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation were estimated at 5.7 billion tonnes CO2eq, representing 1.2% of total emissions. Within the agriculture sector, rice produces almost half the greenhouse gas emissions from croplands, some 30% of agricultural methane emissions, and 11% of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions. Methane is released from rice fields subject to long-term flooding, as this inhibits the soil from absorbing atmospheric oxygen, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic matter in the soil. Emissions can be limited by planting new varieties, not flooding continuously, and removing straw.\nIt is possible to cut methane emissions in rice cultivation by improved water management, combining dry seeding and one drawdown, or executing a sequence of wetting and drying. This results in emission reductions of up to 90% compared to full flooding and even increased yields.\n\n### Effects of climate change on rice production\nPredictions of climate change's effects on rice cultivation vary. Global rice yield has been projected to decrease by around 3.2% with each 1°C increase in global average temperature while another study predicts global rice cultivation will increase initially, plateauing at about 3°C warming (2091–2100 relative to 1850–1900).\nThe impacts of climate change on rice cultivation vary across geographic location and socioeconomic context. For example, rising temperatures and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century decreased rice yield by between 10% and 20% across 200 farms in seven Asian countries. This may have been caused by increased night-time respiration. IRRI has predicted that Asian rice yields will fall by some 20% per 1°C rise in global mean temperature. Further, rice is unable to yield grain if the flowers experience a temperature of 35°C or more for over one hour, so the crop would be lost under these conditions.\nIn the Po Valley in Italy, the arborio and carnaroli risotto rice varieties have suffered poor harvests through drought in the 21st century. The Ente Nazionale Risi  is developing drought-resistant varieties; its nuovo prometeo variety has deep roots that enable it to tolerate drought, but is not suitable for risotto.\n\n## Pests, weeds, and diseases\n\n\n### Pests and weeds\nRice yield can be reduced by weed growth, and a wide variety of pests including insects, nematodes, rodents such as rats, snails, and birds. Major rice insect pests include armyworms, rice bugs, black bugs, cutworms, field crickets, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, mealybugs, and planthoppers. High rates of nitrogen fertiliser application may worsen aphid outbreaks. \nWeather conditions can contribute to pest outbreaks: rice gall midge outbreaks are worsened by high rainfall in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought.\n\n### Diseases\nRice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is the most serious disease of growing rice. \nIt and bacterial leaf streak (caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) are perennially the two worst rice diseases worldwide; they are both among the ten most important diseases of all crop plants. Other major rice diseases include sheath blight (caused by Rhizoctonia solani), false smut (Ustilaginoidea virens), and bacterial panicle blight (Burkholderia glumae). Viral diseases include rice bunchy stunt, rice dwarf, rice tungro, and rice yellow mottle.\nRice plants resist disease by mounting a defence with reactive oxygen species molecules at the site where pathogens are entering. The defence is launched when a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) is detected, triggering a natural immune response (both PAMP-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity). Such immunity requires the gene Os-NADP-ME2. Rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae uses its avirulence effector AVR-Pii to inhibit the rice plant's NADP-malic enzyme. The effect is to suppress the plant's ability to create reactive oxygen species, which means that its innate immunity fails.\n\n### Pest management\nCrop protection scientists are developing sustainable techniques for managing rice pests. Sustainable pest management is based on four principles: biodiversity, host plant resistance, landscape ecology, and hierarchies in a landscape—from biological to social. Farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary, and pesticides may actually induce resurgence of populations of rice pests such as the brown planthopper, both by destroying beneficial insects and by enhancing the pest's reproduction. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an 87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers.\n\nFarmers in China, Indonesia and the Philippines have traditionally managed weeds and pests by the polycultural practice of raising ducks and sometimes fish in their rice paddies. These produce valuable additional crops, eat small pest animals, manure the rice, and in the case of ducks also control weeds.\nRice plants produce their own chemical defences to protect themselves from pest attacks. Some synthetic chemicals, such as the herbicide 2,4-D, cause the plant to increase the production of certain defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plant's resistance to some types of pests. Conversely, other chemicals, such as the insecticide imidacloprid, appear to induce changes in the gene expression of the rice that make the plant more susceptible to certain pests.\nPlant breeders have created rice cultivars incorporating resistance to various insect pests. Conventional plant breeding of resistant varieties has been limited by challenges such as rearing insect pests for testing, and the great diversity and continuous evolution of pests. Resistance genes are being sought from wild species of rice, and genetic engineering techniques are being applied.\n\n## Ecotypes and cultivars\nThe International Rice Research Institute maintains the International Rice Genebank, which holds over 100,000 rice varieties.\nMuch of southeast Asia grows sticky or glutinous rice varieties. High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa, called the New Rice for Africa (NERICA), have been developed to improve food security and alleviate poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nRice cultivars also fall into groups according to environmental conditions, season of planting, and season of harvest, called ecotypes. Some major groups are the Japan-type (grown in Japan), \"bulu\" and \"tjereh\" types (Indonesia); \"aman\" (main winter crop), \"aus\" (\"aush\", summer), and \"boro\" (spring) (Bengal and Assam). Cultivars exist that are adapted to deep flooding, and these are generally called \"floating rice\". \nThe complete genome of rice was sequenced in 2005, making it the first crop plant to reach this status. \nSince then, the genomes of hundreds of types of rice, both wild and cultivated, and including both Asian and African rice species, have been sequenced.\n\n## Biotechnology\n\n\n### High-yielding varieties\nThe high-yielding varieties are a group of crops created during the Green Revolution to increase global food production radically. The first Green Revolution rice variety, IR8, was produced in 1966 at the International Rice Research Institute through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee Geo Woo Gen\". Green Revolution varieties were bred to have short strong stems so that the rice would not lodge or fall over. This enabled them to stay upright and productive even with heavy applications of fertiliser.\n\n### Expression of human proteins\nVentria Bioscience has genetically modified rice to express lactoferrin and lysozyme which are proteins usually found in breast milk, and human serum albumin. These proteins have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Rice containing these added proteins can be used as a component in oral rehydration solutions to treat diarrheal diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements may also help reverse anemia.\n\n### Flood-tolerance\nIn areas subject to flooding, farmers have long planted flood tolerant varieties known as deepwater rice. In South and South East Asia, flooding affects some 20 million hectares (49 million acres) each year. \nFlooding has historically led to massive losses in yields, such as in the Philippines, where in 2006, rice crops worth $65 million were lost to flooding.\nStandard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding for more than about a week, since it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and gas exchange. The Swarna Sub1 cultivar can tolerate week-long submergence, consuming carbohydrates efficiently and continuing to grow. So-called \"scuba rice\" with the Sub1A transgene is robustly tolerant of submergence for as long as two weeks, offering much improved flood survival for farmers' crops. IRRI has created Sub1A varieties and distributed them to Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines.\n\n### Drought-tolerance\nDrought represents a significant environmental stress for rice production, with 19–23 million hectares (47–57 million acres) of rainfed rice production in South and South East Asia often at risk. Under drought conditions, without sufficient water to afford them the ability to obtain the required levels of nutrients from the soil, conventional commercial rice varieties can be severely affected—as happened for example in India early in the 21st century.\nThe International Rice Research Institute conducts research into developing drought-tolerant rice varieties, including the varieties Sahbhagi Dhan, Sahod Ulan, and Sookha dhan, currently being employed by farmers in India, the Philippines, and Nepal respectively. In addition, in 2013 the Japanese National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences led a team which successfully inserted the DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene, from the Philippine upland rice variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants. This facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the IR64 + DRO1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified IR64 variety.\n\n### Salt-tolerance\nSoil salinity poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season. For example, roughly 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of the coastal areas of Bangladesh are affected by saline soils. These high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants' physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these areas.\nProgress has been made in developing rice varieties capable of tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the commercial rice variety IR56 and the wild rice species Oryza coarctata is one example. O. coarctata can grow in soils with double the limit of salinity of normal varieties, but does not produce edible rice. Developed by the International Rice Research Institute, the hybrid variety utilises specialised leaf glands that remove salt into the atmosphere. It was produced from one successful embryo out of 34,000 crosses between the two species; this was then backcrossed to IR56 with the aim of preserving the genes responsible for salt tolerance that were inherited from O. coarctata.\n\n### Cold tolerance\nRice is sensitive to temperatures below 12°C. Sowing takes place once the daily average temperature is reliably above this limit. Average temperatures below that reduce growth; if sustained for over four days, germination and seedling growth are harmed and seedlings may die. In larger plants subjected to cold, rice blast is encouraged, seriously reducing yield. As of 2022, researchers continue to study the mechanisms of chilling tolerance in rice and its genetic basis. Cold-tolerant varieties including of risotto rice and basmati rice have been trialled successfully on peaty soil in England in 2025. If, as is probable, global warming raises the temperature by 2°C or more, rice could be grown across the country.\n\n### Reducing methane emissions\nProducing rice in paddies is harmful for the environment due to the release of methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, consuming nutrients released by rice roots. Putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot, decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Further, the modification increases the amount of rice grains.\n\n### C4 rice\nC4 rice is a proposed rice that uses C4 photosynthesis. It is currently in development by the C4 Rice Consortium.\n\n### Model organism\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the mechanisms of meiosis and DNA repair in higher plants. For example, study using rice has shown that the gene OsRAD51C is necessary for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis.\n\n## In human culture\nRice plays an important role in certain religions and popular beliefs. In Hindu wedding ceremonies, rice, denoting fertility, prosperity, and purity, is thrown into the sacred fire, a custom modified in Western weddings, where people throw rice over the wedded couple. In Malay weddings, rice features in multiple special wedding foods such as sweet glutinous rice. In Japan and the Philippines, rice wine is used for weddings and other celebrations. Dewi Sri is a goddess of the Indo-Malaysian archipelago, who in myth is transformed into rice or other crops. The start of the rice planting season is marked in Asian countries including Nepal and Cambodia with a Royal Ploughing Ceremony.\n\n## See also\nArtificial rice\nDirect seeded rice\nList of rice dishes\nRice Belt\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nLiu, Wende; Liu, Jinling; Triplett, Lindsay; Leach, Jan E.; Wang, Guo-Liang (August 4, 2014). \"Novel insights into rice innate immunity against bacterial and fungal pathogens\".

Rice wines are drunk as a dining beverage in East Asian, Southeast Asian and South Asian cuisine during formal dinners and banquets, and are also used as cooking wines to add flavors or to neutralize unwanted tastes in certain food items (e.g. seafood such as fish and shellfish).\n\n## History\nThe production of rice wine has thousands of years of history. In ancient China, rice wine was the primary alcoholic drink. Rice wine is one of the oldest fermented beverages, with the oldest evidence of rice wine being a rice and honey drink found in central China about 9,000 years ago. In the Shang Dynasty (1750-1100 BCE), funerary objects routinely featured wine vessels. The production of rice wine in Japan is believed to have started around third century BCE, after the introduction of wet rice cultivation. \nAs a result of Alexander the Great's expedition to India, the Roman Empire had begun importing rice wine by the first century BCE.\n\n## Production\nDespite being called a wine, the rice wine's production process has some similarities to that of brewing beer, reflecting its chief ingredient being a grain rather than a fruit. The specific approaches to making rice wine vary by type. Some rice wine (such as the Chinese rice wine, or mijiu) is made from glutinous rice, while others (such as the Japanese Sake) is made from non-glutinous rice. However, all systems combine rice with some fungal culture in some ways. The fungal culture is called jiuqu in Chinese and koji in Japanese. In the traditional Chinese rice-wine-making approach, the glutinous rice is soaked for several days before being steamed, and subsequently is left to cool in a ceramic vat at near room temperature. Then, the jiuqu is added and mixed with the rice. The primary functions of jiuqu are to supply enzymes to convert starch to sugar and to supply yeast for ethanol production. After a few days, the liquid formed in the ceramic vat is combined with  an additional mix of water and fungi to adjust the rice wine's water content.\n\n## Types\n\n\n## See also\nBeer\nChinese alcoholic beverages\nKorean alcoholic beverages\nRice vinegar\nRice wine cup\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nCampbell-Platt, Geoffrey (2009).

    "text": "# Rice production in Bangladesh\n\nRice production in Bangladesh plays a critical role in the nation's economy, affecting various sectors and socioeconomic factors. As the primary crop and staple food, rice is central to agricultural production, employment, and nutritional needs. It is a major contributor to Bangladesh’s national income. With a production of approximately 39.1 million tonnes in 2023, Bangladesh is the third-largest rice producer globally.\nRice is cultivated in three seasons in Bangladesh: aman, aush, and boro. Boro is the leading paddy production crop, heavily reliant on irrigation and fertilisers, followed by aman and aush. Limited mechanisation and climate change hamper the productivity of rice production compared to neighbouring countries. However, the government has been undertaking efforts to increase productivity by developing new high-yielding rice varieties.\n\n## History\nDomesticated rice cultivation in the Bengal region traces back approximately 4,000 years. Through a process of \"artificial selection,\" ancient farmers developed numerous rice landraces, finely tuned to local environmental conditions. Most of these varieties, classified as Indica group (O. sativa), were cultivated in eastern India and Bangladesh. Additionally, a smaller quantity of Japonica rice was grown, particularly in deep-water regions. While the precise count of rice varieties before the Green Revolution remains uncertain, it's estimated that around 15,000 folk landraces thrived in Bengal during the 1940s.\nThe Green Revolution of the 1960s was a pivotal era for Bangladesh's agriculture, significantly enhancing rice production using high-yield varieties. This period was marked by a notable increase in rice output. In the following decade, the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) was established, releasing its first variety, BR1, and laying the groundwork for future advancements in rice breeding. Later, it introduced a high-yielding rice variety known as BR3, which quickly proliferated nationwide, becoming the staple crop across all three cropping seasons of Aus, Aman, and Boro, hence earning the moniker \"BR-revolution.\" Subsequent iterations of rice varieties replaced earlier ones in the following decades, with more than 7,000 traditional rice varieties being replaced by modern, high-yielding counterparts, leading to significant improvements in rice production nationwide. Presently, data suggests that just over 700 rice varieties are actively cultivated in Bangladesh.\nBangladesh's rice production demonstrated a generally increasing trajectory during the 1980s, with the exception of fiscal year 1981. However, the yearly production increases were modest, barely keeping pace with population growth. A milestone was achieved in fiscal year 1986 when rice output surpassed 15 million tonnes for the first time. Despite being the fourth largest global rice producer in the mid-1980s, Bangladesh's rice productivity was low compared to other Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, during that period.\nBy the end of the 20th century, the BRRI had expanded its repertoire to include varieties tailored to the nation's distinct rice-growing seasons, particularly Aman and Boro, further solidifying rice's status in the agricultural sector. From 2001 onwards, the BRRI's extensive trials across various locations have been instrumental in gauging both genetic improvements and environmental influences on rice yields. By 2020, the integration of both traditional and modern rice varieties had led to rice becoming the preeminent crop, dominating a substantial portion of Bangladesh's agricultural landscape. Around the same time, researchers at the BRRI have achieved early success in developing some of the country's first gene-edited rice lines. These lines are anticipated to exhibit effective resistance against diseases such as blast disease, insect pests like the brown planthopper (BPH), and abiotic stresses resulting from high soil salinity. The development of these gene-edited rice varieties represents a biotechnological advancement aimed at enhancing the resilience and productivity of rice cultivation in Bangladesh. Facing the ongoing challenges of climate change, urbanisation, and a burgeoning population, Bangladesh continues to prioritize the advancement of rice breeding to maintain food security and agricultural sustainability.\n\n### Exporting\nIn the fiscal year 2009–10, Bangladesh commenced exporting aromatic rice, with shipments amounting to 663 tonnes. Over subsequent years, the volume of exports increased significantly, reaching 10,879 tonnes in fiscal year 2019–20.\nEfforts were made in 2012 to commence the export of non-aromatic rice due to surplus but failed as the rice was deemed unfit for export. Later, in 2014, Bangladesh initiated the export of 50,000 tonnes of non-fragrant coarse rice to Sri Lanka for the first time under a government-to-government deal, priced at $450 per tonne, driven by strong output and ample government stocks. However, further export initiatives were not pursued due to significant rice imports in that and the preceding year.\nIn 2022, the government imposed restrictions on rice exports, including various varieties of aromatic rice, due to concerns about the country's food situation.\n\n## Significance\nRice is synonymous with food security in Bangladesh, serving as the primary crop and the main staple food for its population. It accounts for 97 percent of total food grain production and is crucial for the nation's nutrition, providing around 60 percent of total calories and 50 percent of protein intake for adults.\nThe crop's significance extends beyond nutrition, as nearly 48 percent of rural workers are involved in rice production, contributing approximately 16 percent to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) of the country and about 70 percent to agricultural GDP. Its significance in the economy is immense, both at the macro and micro levels, considering factors such as production volume, employment, trade, processing, food security, and nutrition. Additionally, its substantial weight in the consumer price index (CPI) can have significant effects on prices, inflation, and poverty.\nRice cultivation occupies about 76 percent of the total cropped area, spanning approximately 10,500,000 hectares (105,000 km2) of land over 13 million farms. This illustrates rice's central role in Bangladesh's economy, agriculture, and food security.\nAs of 2023, Bangladesh ranks as the third-largest producer of rice globally, trailing behind China and India. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, rice production in Bangladesh reached about 39.1 million tonnes in the fiscal year 2022–23 (FY23), while rice imports were around 1.05 million tonnes, a notable decline from 2.65 million tonnes in 2021.\n\n## Cropping seasons\nThere are two rainy season rice crops, called Aman and Aush, and one dry-season crop called Boro.\n\n### Aman\nAman (Bengali: আমন) paddy is the second-largest cereal crop cultivated in Bangladesh, following Boro paddy. It is typically planted between July and August and harvested between November and December. Aman paddy relies entirely on rainfall and covers the largest acreage among rice crops.\nAman paddy is primarily grown in two ways. Some Aman rice is sown in spring using the broadcast method (Bengali: বোনা আমন, romanized: bona aman, lit. 'broadcast Aman'), maturing during the summer rains and being harvested in autumn. Another, more productive method involves starting the seeds in special beds and transplanting them during the summer monsoon season (Bengali: রোপা আমন, romanized: ropa aman, lit. 'transplanted Aman'). Broadcast Aman rice is predominantly grown in the southern and southeastern regions of the country.\n\n### Aush\nThe second harvest, known as Aush or Aus (Bengali: আউশ), typically involves traditional strains of rice but increasingly includes high-yielding, dwarf varieties. Rice for the Aus harvest is sown in March or April, benefiting from the April and May rains, maturing during the summer rainfall, and being harvested during the summer season.\n\n### Boro\nWith the increasing use of irrigation, there has been a growing emphasis on another rice-growing season extending into the dry season. This season, known as Boro (Bengali: বোরো), involves planting rice from mid-November to February and harvesting it from April to June. There are three types of Boro rice: Local Boro, High Yielding Variety (HYV) Boro, and Hybrid Boro. Currently, Boro rice is the leading paddy production crop. The cost of producing HYV Boro rice is relatively high due to the intensive use of expensive inputs such as irrigation and fertiliser. However, following the green revolution, it has gained significance due to its higher yields.\n\n## Challenges and shortcomings\n\n\n### Pests\nAnnual rice production in Bangladesh suffers significant losses, ranging from 4 percent to 14 percent, due to various insect pests. Two prominent diseases have emerged as severe threats to rice crops: bacterial leaf blight (BLB) and ufra disease caused by the nematode D. angustus. Despite the severity of these diseases, the availability of technologies conferring resistance against pests and diseases remains limited, making rice production vulnerable to weather and pest outbreaks.\n\n### Market manipulation\nIn 2021, Bangladesh faced soaring rice prices despite abundant production and increased imports. However, prices remained high as some major market players hoarded rice, driving up prices. This situation particularly impacted farmers and the working class. In response, the government imported 1.35 million tonnes of rice in the 2020–21 financial year at reduced tariffs to stabilize prices. Unfortunately, this strategy has yet to effectively lower retail prices due to ongoing market distortions.\n\n### Poor supply chain planning\nBangladesh continues to import rice through public and private enterprises despite having a significant surplus, even when accounting for non-human consumption factors such as livestock feed, seed, milling loss, warehouse damages, and pre- and post-harvest losses. Experts attribute this issue to the lack of reliable data, criticizing government agencies for inconsistencies. This discrepancy has created a gap between actual demand and supply, often exploited by actors within the supply chain.\n\n### Environmental issues\nResearch indicates that in 2018, Bangladesh was ranked 7th among the top 20 rice-producing countries in terms of methane (CH4) emissions from rice cultivation. In the context of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice cultivation, Bangladesh was ranked 6th among the top 20 rice-producing countries, with total GHG emissions measured at 9903.03 kg CO2 equivalent per hectare. This ranking specifically pertains to the overall GHG emissions, which include not only methane (CH4) but potentially other gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) from fertiliser use and carbon dioxide (CO2) from various agricultural practices.\nThe delayed onset of monsoon rains and occasional heatwaves during the Aus season in certain years exacerbate productivity losses further. Reports indicate that farmers' profits from rice cultivation are dwindling due to rising input costs, including seeds, fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides. Additionally, the high cost of labour and increased supplemental irrigation use due to delayed rainfall contribute to the challenges faced by farmers.\n\n### Limited mechanisation\nExperts point out that while Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in rice production, there remains a considerable gap in productivity, with the growth rate stagnating at around 1%, compared to higher rates in neighbouring countries. Climate change poses a significant challenge, leading to large swaths of arable land remaining uncultivated. Scientists say that the agriculture sector must embark on a transformation, involving the mechanisation of the rice production process. The absence of domestically manufactured high-quality agricultural machinery poses a notable obstacle in the agricultural sector. This challenge is particularly evident in the limitations faced in fully producing larger machines such as threshers, planters, and combine harvesters. Furthermore, access to financial opportunities for farmers adds to the complexity of addressing these limitations.\nFuture challenges facing the agriculture sector include increased humidity causing new diseases, changing climate patterns with decreased rainfall and prolonged winters, rising temperatures, higher sea levels, and growing salinity, all contributing to the productivity lag.\n\n## See also\nBangladesh Rice Research Institute\nAgriculture in Bangladesh\n\n## References\n\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.

    "text": "# Rice production in Pakistan\n\nPakistan holds a significant position in the global rice market and is one of the leading rice-producing countries. The rice sector is crucial for the country's economy, providing livelihoods to a substantial portion of the population and contributing substantially to agricultural exports.\nPakistan is the world's 10th largest producer of rice. Pakistan's exports make up more than 8% of the world's total rice trade. It is an important crop in the agriculture economy of Pakistan. Rice is an important Kharif crop.\nIn 2019, Pakistan produced 7.5 million tonnes of rice and ranked 10th in the largest rice-producing countries. Guard Basmati Rice is the oldest and most famous brand of Guard Agricultural Research and Services Limited the first private sector company with its own Rice Research and Development (R&D) facility in Pakistan.

    "text": "# Roti\n\nRoti is a round flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is commonly consumed in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, East African, and Southeast African countries.\nIt is made from stoneground whole-wheat flour, known as atta, combined into a dough with added water. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Naan from the Indian subcontinent, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread, as is kulcha. Like breads around the world, roti is a staple accompaniment to other foods.\n\n## Etymology\nThe word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word roṭikā, meaning \"bread\".\n\n## Types\nMakki roti: corn flour roti served with sarson ka saag, a classic dish of Punjab.\nAkki roti: Rice flour roti with grated vegetables and spices, served with chutney, a famous dish of Karnataka.\nThalipeeth roti: Maharashtrian roti is made with bajra, jowar, rice, chickpea, and spices, served with yogurt or ghee, also popular in Karnataka.\nMissi roti: Rajasthani roti similar to chapati with added spices like red chili, cumin, and turmeric, served with gravy or vegetables.\nKuttu roti: Buckwheat flour roti with potatoes, gluten-free and common during Navratri fasting.\nRumali roti: Thin, soft roti foldable like a handkerchief, popular in Awadhi, Mughlai, and Hyderabadi cuisine, best served with gravy.\nGur roti: Jaggery and whole wheat flour roti, small and thick, also known as meethi roti.\n\n## Preparation\nRoti is made from a mixture of flour, water, and optionally salt and butter or oil.  They are mixed together to create a dough which is left to rest. The dough is then divided into balls which are flattened with a rolling pin to form rotis. The rotis are then cooked on a tava or pan.\n\n## Variants\n\n\n### Indian subcontinent\nMany variations of flatbreads and roti are found in many cultures across the globe, from the Indian subcontinent to Africa to Oceania to the Malay Peninsula to the Americas. The roti is a traditional flatbread from the Indian subcontinent. It is normally eaten with cooked vegetables or curries; it can be used as a carrier for them. It is made most often from wheat flour, cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a tawa. Traditionally, rotis have also been made from the flour of millet, maize, jowar, bajra, and even rice. Tandoori roti is cooked by sticking the flattened dough to the inside wall of a tandoor oven, where it bakes quickly at a high temperature. Chapatis are made of whole-wheat flour known as atta, mixed into a dough with water, edible oil and optional salt in a mixing utensil called a parat, and is cooked on a tava (flat skillet). It is known as phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki, and maani in Sindhi.\n\n### Caribbean\nRoti is eaten widely across the Caribbean, especially in countries with large Indo-Caribbean populations such as Trinidad and Tobago,  Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica. Originally brought to the islands by indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of these countries. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular street food item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.\nThe roti wrap is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango chutney being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean.  The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti.  The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a \"roti skin\" or \"roti shell\", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a tawa. Certain rotis are also made with ghee or butter.\n\n### Southeast Asia\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, the term encompasses all forms of bread besides the traditional Indian breads (like roti canai) including Western-style bread (like roti john), as well as bing of the Chinese.\nIn Thailand, โรตี is a popular street food that can be eaten as a dessert or as a side dish. Some Thai curries can also be accompanied with a side of roti, primarily Southern Thai curries.\nIn Cambodia, រ៉ូទី is a dessert that is sold as street food. It is similar to both a crêpe and paratha.\n\n### South Africa\nRoti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into Durban cuisine. It is widely eaten by the Indian communities living in South Africa, and is either eaten as a flat bread or a wrap with locally made curries.\nRoti is also often eaten in Cape Coloured and Cape Malay Communities. Two types of roti are eaten: chapati/flat roti and paratha/flaky roti. Flaky roti is also called Malay roti. When eaten with a curry filling, usually mutton, chicken or mince, the roti is called a Salomie. \nA roti gatsby is a popular takeaway dish where the bread of the filled gatsby, a popular sandwich is replaced several rotis and folded.\n\n### Mauritius\nSimilarly as with other countries that were part of the Indian diaspora, roti was introduced to Mauritius by Indian migrants/indentured labourers during the 19th century, and has since been a staple of Mauritian cuisine and a common street food. Roti generally refers to farata (a local pronunciation of paratha), a pancake made of wheat flour and water; other variants include dholl puri, which is layered, and stuffed with boiled and ground dal/split peas, and ti puri, a smaller roti that is fried and usually served with seven different curries.\n\n### Iran\nIn Iran, the two variants of roti are called khaboos and lavash.  These two breads (the former of which is almost exactly prepared like Indian roti) are quite similar to other rotis.\n\n### Elsewhere\nRoti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Owing to Canada's considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there. As Indo-Caribbean people moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. A distinct Toronto offering is the \"East Indian roti\", a variation on the stuffed roti from the West Indies. In some of these cultures, rotis are also being used in the place of pita bread when making burritos, quesadillas, or any other kinds of wraps.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Roti canai\n\nRoti canai (/tʃa'naj/), or roti prata (in Singapore), also known as roti chanai and roti cane, is an unleavened flatbread of Indian origin found in the cuisines of Southeast Asia, especially those of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. It is usually served with dal or other types of curry but can also be cooked in a range of sweet or savoury variations made with different ingredients, such as meat, eggs, or cheese.\n\n## Etymology\nRoti canai is attested as a kind of bread in Malay since at least 1970. Roti is borrowed from Hindi roṭī 'bread'. Canai probably comes from Malay canai 'to roll dough thinly'. Less likely theories suggest that the name comes from the Indian city of Chennai or from Hindi chana 'chickpea, chickpea stew', which it often accompanies.\nIn Singapore, the dish is known as roti prata, from the Indian paratha or parotta.\n\n## History\nSince being introduced around the 19th century, roti canai has become a popular breakfast and snack dish and is one of the most common South Indian foods in the region. It is said that Indians brought the dish during the era of British Malaya. It is served in street mamak stalls located in both rural and urban areas.\nIn Southeast Asia, roti canai can often be found in cities that have populations of Indian descent, especially in Malaysia and Singapore and in northern Sumatra in Indonesia. It has also been theorized that the dish had been introduced much earlier by Indian traders, in the 17th century, in Aceh and North Sumatra, under the name roti cane. In Indonesia, the dish is particularly found in Sumatra, where the Indian Indonesian community is concentrated.\n\n## Description\nRoti canai is a flatbread made from unleavened dough that is composed of fat (usually ghee), flour, and water; some recipes also include sweetened condensed milk. The dough is repeatedly kneaded, flattened, oiled, and folded, creating layers. The dough ball is then flattened, spread out until paper-thin (usually by \"tossing\" it on a flat surface), and gathered into a long rope-like mass. This \"rope\" is then wound into a knot or spiral and flattened, so that it consists of thin flakes of dough when cooked.\nWhen making varieties with fillings, the fillings (eggs, chopped onions, etc.) are spread or sprinkled on the thin sheet of dough, which is then folded with the fillings inside.\n\n## Regional variations\nPlain roti is often referred to as roti kosong (\"empty bread\" in the Malay language).\nTraditionally, roti canai is served with dal (lentil) curry. It may also be served with the following curries:\n\nKari ayam – chicken curry\nKari daging – beef curry\nKari kambing – mutton curry\nKari ikan – fish curry (mostly served with ikan pari)\nKari campur – mixed curry\nKari kacang kuda – chickpea curry\n\n### Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore\nDifferent varieties of roti canai served in Brunei and Malaysia are listed below:\n\nMurtabak, a very thick roti filled with a mixture of egg, meat, onions, and spices. In Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore, it is usually prepared on a griddle like roti canai, but in Indonesia, it is often deep-fried in a wok and very oily. In Thailand, it is called \"mataba\". In Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, murtabak is made using the same dough used for roti canai, and on the same equipment, in the same shops. Most murtabak in Malaysia tend to have less minced meat and more egg than Singaporean murtabak or Johorean murtabak. Murtabak cheese is a variation, with added mozzarella cheese.\nRoti telur, with an egg (telur) stuffing\nRoti jantan, roti telur with two-egg stuffing\nRoti bawang, with onion (bawang) stuffing\nRoti telur bawang, with eggs and onions\nRoti boom (or bom; 'bomb bread'), a smaller but thicker roti, with the dough wound in a spiral; served with sugar and margarine, or with curry.\nRoti planta, stuffed with margarine (often Planta Margarine) and sugar\nRoti sardin, stuffed with canned sardine, with or without egg, and sometimes mixed with ketchup or sambal, similar to murtabak\nRoti pisang, stuffed with sliced bananas\nRoti sayur, stuffed with shredded or sliced vegetables\nRoti salad, raw shredded vegetables rolled up with a piece of roti\nRoti tissue/roti tisu, a tissue-paper-thin and flaky roti, usually with sprinkled sugar and condensed milk. Also called roomali roti, from roomal (Hindi, meaning 'handkerchief').\nRoti kaya, with kaya spread\nRoti maggi, stuffed with prepared instant noodles, usually Maggi brand\nRoti cheese, stuffed with cheese\nRoti milo, stuffed with Milo powder\nRoti cobra, served with curry chicken and a piece of fried egg on top\nRoti banjir (\"flooded roti\"), usually chopped into pieces, with curry poured over the top\nRoti tsunami, roti banjir with added sambal and soft-boiled eggs\nRoti Doll (\"Doll's roti\"), roti banjir with added sambal and a fried egg on top. Most commonly found in northern Malaysia, especially in the town of Alor Setar; named after a customer.\nRoti Sarang Burung (\"bird's nest roti\"), roti cooked in a doughnut shape with a fried egg in the hole, similar to egg in the basket and khachapuri.\n\nRoti prata in Singapore and southern Malaysia is a fried flatbread that is cooked over a flat grilling pan. It is usually served with sugar or a vegetable- or meat-based curry and is also commonly cooked with cheese, onions, bananas, red beans, chocolate, mushrooms, or eggs.\nRoti prata is prepared by flipping the dough into a large thin layer before folding the outside edges inwards. The dough is cooked on a flat, round iron pan measuring about three feet in diameter. The cooking process lasts two to five minutes.\n\nRoti tampal or roti plaster (in Singapore): the roti is plastered on one side with egg, with the yolk left runny or totally cooked.\n\n### Indonesia\nRoti cane came to Indonesia via Muslim Indian migration to Aceh Sultanate, in the northern parts of Sumatra, around the 17th century, and later to the rest of the Dutch East Indies, in the early 19th century. It has since been adopted into the Malay, Acehnese, and Minangkabau cuisine of Sumatra. Consequently, there are Malay, Acehnese, and Minangkabau restaurants serving the dish with mutton curry that are operated by ethnic groups other than Indians. Two types of popular roti cane dishes include sweet roti cane, served with various toppings such as cheese, chocolate sprinkles, and chocolate syrup; and savoury roti cane, served with curry sauce. Today in Indonesia, roti canai is often associated with Acehnese cuisine, despite its Indian origin.\n\nIn Ampel, an Arab quarter in Surabaya, the dish is known as roti maryam, while the Javanese call it roti konde, after its shape, which resembles a hairbun (Javanese: konde). Despite having different names, each variant is derivative of the Indian paratha and is similar in preparation. Indian-influenced roti is typically served with kari kambing (mutton curry).\n\n### Thailand\nIn Thailand, roti (with variations on spelling such as ro tee) is commonly available from street carts, usually halal, sold by Thai Muslims. Roti thitchu (Thai for \"tissue\") is Thai roti canai that is fluffed up by clapping it between two hands inside a dry cloth after frying, served with a Thai Muslim-style beef curry.\nIn other parts of Thailand, roti is also commonly eaten with mango, banana, sugar, condensed milk, jam, peanut butter, or Nutella, although plain egg roti is also available.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nCrêpe\nGoat roti\nRoti jala\nNaan\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nRoti prata video recipe\nRoti Prata, Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board, Singapore (archived)",

The word manda is derived from the Sanskrit word maṇḍaka and roti from the Sanskrit word roṭikā. Maṇḍaka is a wheat-based flatbread mentioned in Sanskrit literature from religious scriptures like Skanda purāṇa to Pākakalā texts like Bhojanakutūhala. As per Skanda purāṇa, maṇḍaka are thin circular symmetrical flat cakes prepared from wheat flour. In Bhojanakutūhala, the detailed recipe of maṇḍaka describes that they are cooked on an upturned pot. In Madanapala Nighantu, several varieties of mandakas are mentioned which are prepared by adding vikola, karkaṭa, drākṣā and kantakäri, among other ingredients. \n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Rwandan cuisine\n\nRwandan cuisine differs from other East African cuisine by its greater plant-based ingredients and sauces, despite considerable overlap in ingredients. Staple foods are largely produced from subsistence agriculture, although with notable regional variation.\n\n## Rural-urban gap\nDietary patterns differ between urban and rural residents. Urban populations tend to consume higher amounts of processed foods, soft-drinks, sweets, meat, eggs, milk, coffee or tea, and deep fried foods. While rural populations rely more heavily on traditional staple foods.\n\n## History\nHistorically, dietary habits in Rwanda varied by ethnic group: the Hutus primarily farmed and some hunting, consuming mostly plant-based foods with occasional meat; the Twa focused on hunting and wild foods, supplemented by plants; and the Tutsis, as pastoralists, consumed relatively large amounts of milk and dairy products compared with other groups.\nRwanda's cuisine has also been influenced by other regions. Many crops, like potatoes (mainly grown in Gitarama and Butare) and  maize (used to make ugali), came from South America through colonial introductions. Indian foods, such as chapati and samosas, arrived via trade along the Swahili Coast and are now widely eaten. Neighbouring countries like Tanzania influenced Rwandan cuisine, introducing foods like Mandazi.\n\n## Staples\nRwandan staples include rice, bananas, plantains, sweet potatoes, ugali, beans, and cassava. Most people in rural areas rely on farming, and many farmers do not sell their crops because it may be hard to reach markets. Meat such as beef, goat, chicken and tilapia is also commonly eaten.\n\n## Rwandese dishes\n\n\n### Breakfast dishes\nRwandan people typically eat simple foods in the morning. Common choices include roasted sweet potatoes, cassava or plantains, as well as porridge made from maize, sorghum or cassava. Tea or coffee, often sweetened and sometimes with milk, is usually served alongside. In urban areas, breads like Mandazi or Chapati are also commonly eaten.\n\n### Lunch dishes\nIn Rwanda, lunch is generally the main meal of the day. Meals typically include a staple food such as rice, beans, potatoes, cassava, or plantains, with vegetables or occasionally meat, fish, or eggs, depending on availability or region.\nDishes common at lunch include:\n\nIsombe —cassava leaves cooked with ground peanuts and vegetables\nUgali—a firm dough made from maize or cassava flour eaten with beans, vegetables and meat\nMatoke—boiled or steamed green plantains, sometimes mashed\nBrochettes—grilled meat on a skewer, usually goat or beef\nTilapia—whole fried or grilled freshwater fish\nPilau—spiced rice, sometimes cooked with meat\nIbihaza—pumpkin cooked with beans\n\n### Other foods\nRwandans also eat smaller foods as snacks, especially in the evening or when socialising.\nExamples include:\n\nSambaza—tiny fried lake fish, usually eaten as whole\nAkabenz—fried pork pieces, often served with chili or onions\nChapati—flatbread cooked on a pan\nSamosa—fried pastry with meat or vegetables\nMandazi—slightly sweet fried dough snack\n\n## Beverages\nDrinks in Rwanda range from milk-based drinks to alcoholic beverages.\nNon-alcoholic drinks include:\n\nIkivuguto—thick fermented milk consumed in many households\nIgikoma—thin porridge made from sorghum or maize\nTea or coffee—often sweetened\nFruit juice—locally made from fruits like passionfruit, pineapple, mango\nSoda—fanta is the most popular brand\nAlcoholic drinks include:\n\nPrimus, Mützig and Amstel — popular commercial beers\nUrwagwa — banana beer made from fermented banana juice\nIkigage—beer from dry sorghum\nUbuki— beer from fermented honey\n\n## See also\nUgandan cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\nAdekunle, Julius (2007).

    "text": "# Saint Lucian cuisine\n\nSaint Lucian cuisine is a combination of French, East Indian and British dishes. Before colonization, the Caribs and the Arawaks occupied the island, surviving on its various natural fruits and vegetables like mangoes, oranges, tangerines, avocados, and breadfruit.\n\n## Specialties\nSt Lucia is known for its national dish consisting of green bananas and saltfish locally known as \"green figs and saltfish\"; breadfruit and saltfish is an alternative favourite among the locals. \n\nOther speciality dishes include bouyon, a thick red beans one-pot soup meal made of meat, ground provisions (ground tuber foods) and vegetables. Other popular local dishes include callaloo soup, accra (a fried snack composed of flour, egg, seasoning and the main ingredient of saltfish, usually prepared around Easter), green fig salad (actually made with green bananas), cocoa tea (a traditional breakfast spiced hot drink) and bakes (fried bread, also referred to as \"floats\") among others. \n\nThe island's British and Indian influences are seen in the variety of spices used in its cuisine, which include garlic, cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa, parsley, cloves, and allspice. A wide range of local fruits like golden apples, mangoes, starfruit, and tamarind are used to make juices, although lime juice (lime squash) seems a more popular choice to be enjoyed in conjunction with the local specialties.\n\n## See also\nPiton (beer)\nTourism in Saint Lucia\nCaribbean cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\"Discover Saint Lucia Culinary\".

    "text": "# Sambar (dish)\n\nSāmbār, or sambhar, is a lentil-based vegetable spiced curry or stew, cooked with pigeon peas and tamarind broth. It originates in South Indian cuisine and is also eaten in other parts of India.\n\n## History\nThe recorded history of sambar is vague.\nVerse 2.98 of Amuktamalyada (c. 1517), a Telugu poem by the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya, mentions the word \"sambarampuchintapandu\". According to a 2010 translation by Srinivas Sistla of Andhra University, the poem mentions \"Sambar ingredients packed in separate packs, jaggery, tamarind paste\" while describing the food that Periyalvar's wife packs at Srivilliputhur in present-day Tamil Nadu. Bahujanapalli Sitaramacharyulu's dictionary Sabdaratnakaramu (1885) and Vedam Venkataraya Sastry's commentary (1927) on the poem also interpret the word in the same way. Therefore, Sistla theorizes that sambar must have been an integral part of the Tamil cuisine by the 16th century.\nAccording to food historian K. T. Achaya (1994), the earliest extant reference to sambar, as \"huli\", can be dated to the 17th century in present-day Karnataka. Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya, a 1648 text by the Kannada scholar Govinda Vaidya, mentions huli (puli) (literally \"sourness\"), a curry similar to the modern sambar, made with vegetables and toor dal.\nAccording to a legend, sambar was first made in the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom during the reign of Shahuji I (r. 1684–1712). The legend states that during a visit by Sambhaji, a king or his royal chef substituted kokum with tamarind in the traditional amti (lentil soup), and added some vegetables to it: the resulting curry was named sambar or sambhar after Sambhaji. Sourish Bhattacharyya, in The Bloomsbury Handbook of Indian Cuisine (2023), notes that the fathers of Shahuji I and Sambhaji were half-brothers and not on good terms, which reduces the credibility of this legend. However, Bhattacharyya adds that it is possible that Shahuji named the dish after Sambhaji as part of his attempts to establish cordial relations between the two families.\n\n## Regional variations\nIn southern states of India, namely Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, sambar is made using different vegetables along with lentils or coconut. Each region has its own version of making sambar; even though the same vegetables are used, the condiments and ingredients, as well as the methods, differ. In Tulu-speaking areas of coastal Karnataka, coconut is predominantly used to prepare koddel (sambar). Grated coconut is ground with spices to form a paste which is added to boiled vegetables. In Kannada-speaking areas it is called saaru.\n\n## See also\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Samosa\n\nA samosa () () is a fried Indian pastry with a savoury filling that mostly consists of vegetables like spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but can include cheese such as paneer, meat or even fish. Its name originates from the Middle Persian word sambosag (سنبوسگ) (meaning 'triangular pastry'). It is made in different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet versions containing traditional Indian flavours or even chocolate are also made. Samosas are popular snacks in South Asia and within the Indian diaspora across the world.\n\n## Etymology\nThe English word samosa derives from the Hindustani word samosa (Hindi: समोसा), traceable to the Middle Persian word sambōsag (سنبوسگ) 'triangular pastry'. Similar pastries are called sambusak in Arabic from Persian; medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it sambusaj. All these word-forms are borrowed from the Persian.\n\n## History\nThe Indian samosa is believed to be derived from a medieval precursor from the Middle East that was baked and not deep fried. The earliest mention of a samosa precursor was by Abbasid-era poet Ishaq al-Mawsili, praising the sanbusaj. Recipes are found in 10th–13th-century  Arab cookery books, under the names sanbusak, sanbusaq, and sanbusaj, all deriving from the Persian word sanbosag. In Iran, the dish was popular until the 16th century, but by the 20th century its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the sambusas of Larestan). Abolfazl Beyhaqi (995–1077), an Iranian historian, mentioned it in his history, Tarikh-e Beyhaghi.\nThe Central Asian samsa was introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the 13th or 14th century by chefs from the Middle East and Central Asia who cooked in the royal kitchens for the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. Amir Khusro (1253–1325), a scholar and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate, wrote around 1300 CE that the princes and nobles enjoyed the \"samosa prepared from meat, ghee, onion, and so on\". Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century traveller and explorer, describes a meal at the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq, where the samushak or sambusak, a small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachios, walnuts and spices, was served before the third course of pulao. Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi, a medieval Indian cookbook started for Ghiyath Shah, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India, mentions the art of making samosa. The Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century Mughal document, mentions the recipe for qottab, which it says, \"the people of Hindustan call sanbúsah\".\nThe samosa gained its popularity for its savoury flavour and convenience. The pocket-sized food item was a readily available snack for workers and travellers across India and Central Asia.\n\n## Regional varieties\n\n\n### India\nIn India, samosas are prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potatoes, onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chillies. A samosa can be either vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil to a golden-brown colour. It is served hot, often as a chaat street food, with fresh chutneys. In the Indian states of Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, singaras (সিঙ্গারা) or shingras (চিংৰা) (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller than in other parts of India, with a filling of cooked diced potato, peanuts, and sometimes raisins. In Hyderabad, a smaller version with a thicker pastry crust and minced meat filling, called lukhmi, is eaten.\nBoth flat (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular in Bangladesh. A Bengali version of the full-shaped samosa is called a সিঙাড়া (shingara) and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The shingara is usually filled with pieces of potatoes, vegetables, and nuts. Samosas are called singadas in the eastern part of Nepal, from their shape which is like a water caltrop (shingara in Eastern India); the rest of the country calls it samosa.\nA distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called kaghazi samosa (Urdu: کاغذی سموسہ; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a wonton or spring roll wrapper. Fillings include beef, chicken, and lamb, or they can be made as a sweet.\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in Maldivian cuisine are known as bajiyaa. They are filled with a mixture including fish like tuna and onions.\n\n### Central Asia\nThe samsa is a savoury pastry in Central Asian cuisines such as that of Uzbekistan. It consists of a pastry stuffed with meat and sometimes vegetables and baked in a tandoor oven, rather than being fried. \nIn Tajik cuisine, sambusa-i varaki are triangular pastries, filled with minced beef or mutton mixed with tail fat, flavoured with onions and spices, and  baked in a tandoor oven.\n\n### Southeast Asia\nSamosas are called samuza (စမူဆာ) in Burmese, and are an extremely popular street snack in Burma. Samosas are also used in a traditional Burmese salad called samuza thoke (စမူဆာသုပ်‌; lit. 'samosa salad'), a salad of cut samosa pieces with onions, cabbage, fresh mint, light potato and chickpea curry broth, masala, chili powder, salt and lime.\nIn Indonesia, snacks similar similar to samosas include pastel, panada and epok-epok.\n\n### Africa\nAll across East Africa, samosas, known by several variants of the name, are popular. In Somalia, sambuus filled with vegetables, meat, or seafood are eaten on special occasions. Samosas, locally called samoussas, are a popular snack on Réunion. They are filled with chicken, cheese, crabs or potatoes.\nSouth African samoosas tend to be smaller than Indian ones. Samosa dough is also used for a flatbread called farmaas puri, which consists of rolled-up sheets of dough stacked with minced meat, which are cut into thin circles and deep fried. Originating in South Africa, farmaas puri spread to Gujarati communities in India and Pakistan, where it is popular during Ramadan.\nIn West African countries such as Ghana and Nigeria, samosas are a common street food. In Nigeria, they are usually served in parties along with chicken or beef, puff puff, spring rolls and plantains and are among the finger foods called \"small chops\".\n\n### Middle East\nSambousek (Arabic: سمبوسك) are usually filled with either meat, onion, pine nuts, za’atar, spinach dock, or cheese. Sambousek is most popular during Ramadan.\nSambuseh (Persian: سمبوسه) originated in Iran but is now rare there. The sweet fried pastry qottab is derived from it. Modern Iranian Sambuseh is made either with a sausage and pizza cheese based filling, or with vegetables.\nSambusak (Hebrew: סמבוסק) comes in several distinct forms, as sambusak has been influenced differently by Sephardic and Mizrahi cuisine. Sephardi sambusak is generally thicker, baked, and stuffed with either cheese or beef and coated with sesame or nigella seeds. Mizrahi sambusak is generally thinner, larger, fried, and stuffed with curry-spiced chickpea and onion, and is usually not coated with seeds.\n\n### Portuguese-speaking regions\nIn Goa (India), Portugal, and Angola, samosas are known as chamuças. They are filled with chicken, beef, pork, lamb or vegetables, and generally served quite hot. Samosas are an integral part of Goan Catholic and Portuguese cuisine, where they are a common snack.\n\n### English-speaking regions\nSamosas are popular in the United Kingdom and the English-speaking Commonwealth including Canada, and in the United States. They may be called samboosa or sambusac, but in South Africa, they are often called samoosa. Frozen samosas are increasingly available. Variations can be made using filo, or flour tortillas.\n\n## See also\n\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Sandalwood\n\nSandalwood is a class of woods from trees in the genus Santalum. The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have suffered over-harvesting in the past.\n\n## Nomenclature\nThe nomenclature and the taxonomy of the genus are derived from this species' historical and widespread use. Etymologically it is ultimately derived from Sanskrit चन्दन Chandana (čandana), meaning \"wood for burning incense\" and related to candrah, \"shining, glowing\" and the Latin candere, to shine or glow. It arrived in English via Late Greek, Medieval Latin and Old French in the 14th or 15th century.\n\n## True sandalwoods\nSandalwoods are medium-sized hemiparasitic trees, and part of the same botanical family as European mistletoe. True sandalwoods are native to Insular Southeast Asia, Melanesia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The main cultivated species, Santalum album, were introduced in ancient times into mainland Asia by Austronesian traders and have since naturalized in South Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, southeastern China, and Taiwan. The main distribution of both wild and introduced sandalwood trees are in the drier tropical regions of India and the Indonesian islands of Timor and Sumba. \nS. album spread to other regions through the Austronesian maritime trade network, the incense trade route, and the Maritime Silk Road, until the sixteenth century CE. The sandalwood produced in peninsular India and the Malay Archipelago supported most consumption in East Asia and West Asia during the time of the incense trade route before the commercialization of Australian sandalwood (Santalum spicatum) in sandalwood plantations in Australia and China, although sandalwood album (Santalum album) is still considered to have the best and original quality in terms of religion and alternative medicine. Santalum spicatum is marketed as the notable member of this group today by merchants because of its stable sources; others in the genus also have fragrant wood. \n\nS. album is a threatened species native to dry tropical regions of Indonesia (Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands), the Philippines, and Western Australia. It was one of the plants exploited by Austronesian arboriculture and it was introduced by Austronesian sailors to Mainland Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia, during the ancient spice trade, becoming naturalized in South India by at least 1300 BCE. In India, the principal sandal tracts are most parts of Karnataka and adjoining districts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices had risen to US$3,000 per liter by 2017.\nS. ellipticum, S. freycinetianum, and S. paniculatum, the Hawaiian sandalwood (ʻiliahi), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, S. haleakalae, occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although S. freycinetianum and S. paniculatum are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and S. ellipticum remains rare.\nS. yasi, a sandalwood from Fiji and Tonga.\nS. spicatum is used by aromatherapists and perfumers. The oil concentration differs considerably from other Santalum species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia's biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than 20,000 kg (44,100 lb) per year – much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe. Although overall production has decreased, by 2011, a significant percentage of its production was heading to the chewing tobacco industry in India alongside Indian sandalwood – the chewing tobacco market being the largest market for both oils in 2012.\nOther species: Commercially, various other species, not belonging to Santalum species, are also used as \"sandalwood.\"\n\n### Unrelated plants\nVarious unrelated plants with scented wood and also referred to as \"sandalwood,\" but are not in the true sandalwood genus:\n\nAdenanthera pavonina – sandalwood tree, red or false red sandalwood\nBaphia nitida – camwood, also known as African sandalwood\nEremophila mitchellii – sandalwood; false sandalwood (also sandalbox)\nMyoporum platycarpum – sandalwood; false sandalwood\nMyoporum sandwicense – bastard sandalwood, false sandalwood\nOsyris lanceolata – African sandalwood\nOsyris tenuifolia – east African sandalwood\nPterocarpus santalinus – false red sandalwood growing in southern Indian regions\n\n## Production\nProducing commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils requires Indian sandalwood (S. album) trees to be a minimum of 15 years old – the yield, quality and volume are yet to be clearly understood. Yield of oil tends to vary depending on the age and location of the tree; usually, the older trees yield the highest oil content and quality. India continues to produce a superior quality of Santalum Album, with FP Aromatics being the largest exporter. Australia is the largest producer of S. album, with the majority grown around Kununurra, in the far north of Western Australia by Quintis (formerly Tropical Forestry Services), which in 2017 controlled around 80% of the world's supply of Indian sandalwood, and Santanol. India used to be the world's biggest producer, but it has been overtaken by Australia in the 21st century. Over-exploitation is partly to blame for the decline. However, ethical plantations in India are on the rise, and India is expected to increase its supply manyfold by 2030, owing to favourable weather conditions and competitive pricing.\nAustralian sandalwood (S. spicatum) is grown in commercial plantations throughout the wheatbelt of Western Australia, where it has been an important part of the economy since colonial times. As of 2020 Western Australia has the largest plantation resource in the world.\nSandalwood is expensive compared to other types of woods. To maximize profit, sandalwood is harvested by removing the entire tree instead of felling at the trunk near ground level. This way wood from the stump and root, which possesses high levels of sandalwood oil, can also be processed and sold.\nAustralian sandalwood is mostly harvested and sold in log form, graded for heartwood content. The species is unique in that the white sapwood does not require removal before distilling the oil. The logs are either processed to distill the essential oil, or made into powders for making incense. Indian sandalwood, used mainly for oil extraction, does require removal of the sapwood prior to distillation. As of 2020, Australian sandalwood oil sold for around US$1,500 per 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) (US$3,307 per lb), while Indian sandalwood oil, due to its higher alpha-santalol content, is priced at about US$2,500 per kg (US$5,512 per lb).\nSandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with African blackwood, pink ivory, agarwood and ebony.\nSandalwood has historically been an important tree in the development of the political economy of the Pacific. Prior to colonization in the region, the sandalwood tree was a marker of status, rank and beauty. It then became an important part of the Pacific trade during the colonial period, as it was one of the few resources the West was able to successfully trade with Chinese merchants. This western trade began to put pressure on the production of sandalwood in the region.\nTonga, a Polynesian kingdom in the Oceania region, saw a collapse of its sandalwood tree population (locally known as ʻahi) due to the disruption of fahu, the hierarchical kinship-based social system which traditionally governed ʻahi harvest. When, in the early 1980s, a Chinese merchant willing to pay high prices arrived at the island of Haʻano, lower-ranking family members began to harvest the trees without permission, encouraging many farmers to harvest their trees defensively, leading to overharvest. Nearly all of the sandalwood resources on the island were depleted over the span of two years. Anthropologist Mike Evans concluded, \"whatever the short-term ecological benefits of enforcing privatized land tenure, because private property not only fragments social ties by allowing an individual to deny others, it has the potential to fragment the regional ecology as well.\"\n\n## Uses\n\n\n### Fragrance\nSandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent. Its quality and scent profile is greatly influenced by the age of the tree, location and the skill of the distiller. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, fougère, and chypre families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a perfume, it acts as a fixative, enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite. Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the \"floriental\" (floral-ambery) fragrance family – when combined with white florals such as jasmine, ylang ylang, gardenia, plumeria, orange blossom, tuberose, lily of the valley, etc. Its also acts as a versatile base that blends well with other woody scents like patchouli and cedar.\nSandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, S. album, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as \"sandalwood\". The genus Santalum has more than 19 species. Traders often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (Amyris balsamifera) in the family Rutaceae or bastard sandalwood (Myoporum sandwicense, Myoporaceae). However, most woods from these alternative sources lose their aroma within a few months or years.\nIsobornyl cyclohexanol is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product.\nSandalwood's main components are the two isomers of santalol (about 75%). It is used in aromatherapy, in scented candles and to prepare soaps.\n\n### Idols/sculptures\nSandalwood lends itself well to carving and has thus, traditionally, been a wood of choice for statues and sculptures of Hindu gods.\n\n### Technology\nDue to its low fluorescence and optimal refractive index, sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and fluorescence microscopy.\n\n### Food\nAboriginal Australians eat the seed kernels, nuts, and fruit of local sandalwoods, such as the quandong (S. acuminatum).\nEarly Europeans in Australia used quandong in cooking damper by infusing it with its leaves, and in making jams, pies, and chutneys from the fruit. In Scandinavia, pulverised bark from red sandalwood (Pterocarpus soyauxii) is used—with other tropical spices—when marinating anchovies and some types of pickled herring such as matjes, sprat, and certain types of traditional spegesild, inducing a reddish colour and slightly perfumed flavour.\nPresent-day chefs have begun experimenting in using the nut as a substitute for macadamia nuts or a bush food substitute for almonds, hazelnuts, and others in Southeast Asian-styled cuisine. The oil is also used as a flavour component in different food items, including candy, ice cream, baked food, puddings, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and gelatin. The flavouring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.\n\n## Distillation\nOil is extracted from sandalwood through distillation. Many different methods are used, including steam distillation, water distillation, CO2 extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures (60–100 °C or 140–212 °F) and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, but can be released by the high heat of the steam. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil's distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.\n\n## Religion\n\n\n### Hinduism\nSandalwood is considered sacred in the Hindu Ayurveda and is known in Sanskrit as chandana. The wood is used for worshipping the deities, and it is said that Lakshmi (Sri), the goddess of well-being, lives in the sandalwood tree; therefore, it is also known as Srigandha. \nSandalwood paste is prepared by grinding a piece of dry sandalwood into powder, against a stone slab. With the gradual addition of water, a thick paste forms, (called kalabham \"കളഭം\" in Malayalam language and gandha ಗಂಧ in Kannada) and it is mixed with saffron or other such pigments to make chandanam. Chandanam, further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in javadhu. Kalabham, chandanam, and javadhu are dried and used as kalabham powder, chandanam powder, and javadhu powder, respectively. Chandanam powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. \nIn Tirupati, after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In Hinduism and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.\nThis paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, for making religious utensils, for decorating sacred images, and it is believed to calm the mind during meditation and prayer. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or necks and chests. Sandalwood paste is used for most pujas both in temples and private households.\n\n### Jainism\nSandalwood use is an integral part of the daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship the Tirthankaras of Jainism. Sandalwood powder is showered as blessings by Jain monks and nuns (sadhus and sadhvis) onto their disciples and followers. Sandalwood garlands are used to dress the body during Jain cremation ceremonies. During the festival of Mahamastakabhisheka that is held once in every 12 years, the Gommateshwara statue is bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion.\n\n### Buddhism\nSandalwood is mentioned in various suttas of the Pāli Canon. In some Buddhist traditions, sandalwood is considered to be of the padma (lotus) group and attributed to Amitabha Buddha. Sandalwood scent is believed by some to transform one's desires and maintain a person's alertness while in meditation. It is also one of the most popular scents used when offering incense to the Buddha and the guru.\n\n### Sufism\nIn the Indian variants of Sufism, sandalwood paste is applied on a revered Sufi's grave by the disciples as a mark of devotion. The tradition is practiced particularly by devotees in the Indian subcontinent. In Tamil culture, irrespective of one's religious identity, sandalwood paste or powder is applied to the graves of Sufi saints as a mark of devotion and respect.\n\n### East Asian religions\nIn East Asia, sandalwood (檀木) is the most commonly used incense material by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese in worship and various ceremonies. Some Taoist sects, following the Ming Dynasty Taoist Manual, avoid the use of sandalwood (as well as benzoin resin and frankincense) as incense in worship. In Korean Shamanism, sandalwood is considered the Tree of Life. It was transmitted to China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan during the eastward expansion of Buddhism.\n\n### Zoroastrianism\nZoroastrians offer sandalwood twigs to the afarganyu, the urn in which the fire is kept at the fire temple (called agiyari in Gujarati and dar-e mehr in Persian), to keep the fire burning during religious ceremonies. After the firekeeping priests complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the afarganyu and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the Yasna and Yashts (sacred texts) as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the three grades of fire in the fire temple, including the Atash Dadgahs. Sandalwood is not offered to the divo, a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the mobad (priest) as payment, along with sandalwood. Sandalwood is called sukhad in the Zoroastrian community. The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a source of income for the fire temple.\n\n## See also\nSandalore\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nMandy Aftel, Essence and Alchemy: A Natural History of Perfume, Gibbs Smith, 2001, ISBN 1-58685-702-9\nDorothy Shineberg (1967), They came for sandalwood; a study of the sandalwood trade in the South-West Pacific 1830-1865, Melbourne, Melbourne University Press.\n\n## External links\n\nPlant Cultures: botany, history and use of sandalwood (archived 9 May 2008)\nIUCN Threatened Species: Santalum album",

    "text": "# Saraswat cuisine\n\nKonkani cuisine is the cuisine of the Saraswat Brahmins from the Konkan region on the western coast of India.

Konkani cuisine is usually pesco-vegetarian, except acharyas and purohits who follow a strictly saatvik vegetarian diet.\nAccording the Konkani folklore, fish, meats are regarded as sea vegetables. Historically, they have refrained from eating any terrestrial animals in general.\n\n## Lacto-vegetarian Saraswat cuisine\nTheir curries use a lot of coconut, coconut oil, tamarind, kokum& curry leaves and the cuisine is largely influenced by South Indian cuisine. The cuisine is very similar to Malvani cuisine of southern Konkan and Udupi or Mangalorean cuisine. Their cuisine is less spicy and has less Portuguese cuisine influences than the cuisine of their Goan Catholic counterparts. Hooman ani xit (fish curry and steamed rice) is the staple food of the Saraswat Brahmins of Goa, whereas the regular consumption of Indian breads such as puris, chapatis and parathas are seen mainly amongst the Saraswat Brahmin of Maharashtra, India. Satvik Brahmin (sub-set of Saraswat Brahmins), which is a strictly vegetarian cuisine that does not use vegetables that grow underground, such as onions, potatoes, garlic, etc.  Dishes such as Savalem raandaap are prepared among the Bhats (Priests), conservative Goud Saraswat Brahmins and Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmins. This is followed by most Konkani families on festivals like Ganesh Chaturthi follow this style of cooking. On certain days (Mondays in particular), some Saraswat Brahmins eat only vegetarian food. This is particularly true in families whose Kuldevta (clan deity) or other family deities like Mangesh, Nagueshi or any other form of Mahadeva Shiva. In Punjab and Jammu region, Saraswat Brahmins traditionally observe strict lacto vegetarian diet.\n\n## Various Saraswat cuisines\n\n\n### Rajapur Saraswat cuisine\nThis cuisine forms a part of lacto-vegetarian cuisine. This cuisine has the combination of Goan, Udupi and Malvani cuisine culture.\nKhatkhatem, a stew containing at least six vegetables, is popular. Other popular dishes include bhaji or shaak (made from different vegetable curry and fruit), vaal bhaji (a curry/dish made out of drumsticks) usli/Usal (spicy pulses in a thin watery gravy), misal (usal topped with fried snacks), tondak (beans combined with cashews), rass (coconut-based dishes), undri (a dish made out of rice flour, jaggery, and coconut), ghawan (a special variant of dosa, which is similar to neer dose, a Tuluva dish) hoomans (different types of curries), karams (vegetable salads), lonche (Indian pickles) and papads/happal (flatbread). Fast foods include Moongacho gathi (curried green gram), botatyache patal bhaji (potato curry), tur dal ross (split pigeon pea curry), etc.\n\n### Chitrapur Saraswat cuisine\nChitrapur Saraswat cuisine is unique and its various forms have been published in the Rasachandrika book both in Marathi and English. These are recipes that would have been passed down from mother to daughter or daughter-in-law. The cuisine consists either of curries and vegetables made with ground fresh coconut gratings or tempered beans, sprouts, pulses (dals) garnished with coconut gratings. However, nowadays, for health reasons, the use of coconut gratings is kept to a minimum. \nTypical Bhanap or Amchi (as the Chitrapur Saraswats refer to themselves) dishes are: \n\nBatata Song (potatoes cooked with tamarind, onions, garlic, chili powder and turmeric)\nDalithoy\nPatoleo\nPatrode\nSurnoli\nKairus (ground coconut base with spices, capsicum, potatoes, tamarind, peanuts and cashews)\nSukke (ground coconut base, spices and a variety of vegetables like potatoes)\nKnolkhol (kohlrabi), peas, cauliflower, okra\nAmbat\nGhashees\nMango pickle made with unripe Apinmedi mango\n\n## Pesco-vegetarian cuisine\nMost konkani Saraswat Brahmins are pesco-vegetarians. The inclusion of fish in the diet is not looked upon as non-vegetarian. Legend has it that when the Saraswati River dried up, the Saraswats who could not farm were permitted to eat sea food/fish. The fish were euphemistically called sea vegetable or झळकें from ( जल काय -Jal Kaay). Oysters, for example, are sometimes called samudra phalam, or 'sea fruit'.\nA typical breakfast in a Saraswat home may include pez (congee) of ukdem tandhul (parboiled rice) and lonche (pickles) and papad. Wealthier homes may serve dosa, idli (in South Canara, Karnataka and other parts of South India) or sannas (in Goa), along with chutney or sambhar. Shevaiyn phann or phow are other breakfast foods occasionally served. Rotis and bhakris are typical types of bread eaten along with tondak or seasoned batatabhaji (potato stir-fry preparation).\nLunch and dinner may feature daat dalitoi and rice (xit, pronounced sheeth) in a Dorke's home, whereas Bhanaps would prefer ambat with their rice for kalvani. A typical Saraswat lunch would have sheeth, roass or varann; if the diner is not vegetarian, lunch may include hoomann, bhaji, tondak, lonche, papodd, and toi or kadhi. Kadhi is made to serve the dual purpose of mukhashuddhhi (mouth purification, perhaps after all the relatively spicy stuff) and jeervonn (digestive kadhis include asafoetida, vomvom, jeera, fennel seed). Sometimes the kadhis are seasoned simply with karivel and sanswam (mustard seeds). Typically, this is a watery preparation which the luncher cups in his hand as it is poured onto his plate and drinks it before mixing a small portion of his rice with it to eat at the end of the meal. The most savoured as well as preferred kadhis amongst the Konkani Saraswat Brahmins is the kokumachi kadhi or konkam kadhi. Kokum is a fruit found and grown within the western Konkan coast of India and is commonly used in Saraswat cuisine. Formally it is often said that no meal is complete without kokum khadhi.\n\n## See also\nGoan cuisine\nBengali cuisine\nChitrapur Saraswat Brahmin\nGaud Saraswat Brahmin\nRajapur Saraswat Brahmin\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\nPHILAR, ASHA (2011).

    "text": "# Sel roti\n\nSel roti (Nepali: सेल रोटी) is a traditional Nepalese ring-shaped sweet fried dough made from rice flour. It is mostly prepared during Dashain and Tihar, widely celebrated Hindu festivals in Nepal as well as Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Sikkim and the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. The dish is popular throughout Nepal. Sel roti is made from a batter of rice flour, water, sugar, ghee, and spices which is then deep-fried in cooking oil.\n\n## Origin and etymology\nDinesh Raj Panta, a professor at Nepal Sanskrit University, estimates this dish to be over 800 years old. According to Madhulika Dash, an Indian food columnist, the dish was made bland many years ago, without sugar and spices. Over the years with intermingling of various ethnicities of Nepal, the dish has reached in its modern form. Dash also estimates that sel roti may have been a modified form of Blbabari, a Nepalese rice pancake. Babari is made of the same batter but is cooked like a pancake on a shallow griddle while sel roti is ring-shaped and deep-fried on a karahi.\nThe name of the dish is assumed to be derived from sel, a variety of rice that grows in the foothills of Nepal. Roti in Nepali translates to 'bread'. Another theory also suggests that the name of the dish is from saal, the Nepali word for 'year'. Since the dish was developed to be a ceremonial dish made on the Nepalese new year, it may have been called saal roti, which later had become sel roti.\n\n## Preparation and ingredients\nIt is made of rice flour with added flavours. A batter is prepared by adding water, sugar, and ghee to roughly ground rice flour. The ghee can also be substituted by cooking oil or butter. Spices such as cardamom and clove may be added to the batter. The ingredients are then allowed to rest for a few hours. Studies show that letting the batter sit for about six hours at around 30 °C makes sel roti taste better and more cost-effective to prepare. During this time, natural bacteria and yeast ferment the batter and make it more acidic. This extra acidity helps the sel roti soak up less oil during frying, so it turns out less greasy, more flavorful, and more economical.\nOnce the batter is set, it is deep-fried in cooking oil or ghee. Instead of water, milk can also be used to prepare the batter. However, using milk can reduce the shelf life of the dish. When stored properly (for example, in a dry, airtight container), sel roti can remain edible for about two weeks at room temperature.\n\nThe dough is poured by hand in a ring shape into boiling oil and cooked on medium heat (around 348 °F to 373 °F) until it turns light brown on both sides. Two metallic or wooden sticks (known as jhir in Nepali language), each about 1 foot (30 cm) long, are used for turning the dough while cooking.\nSel roti are cooked in bulk and can be stored at room temperature for least 20 days. Sel roti are often sent as special gifts to family members living away from home or used as prasada, a religious offering. Sel roti is also featured in contemporary publications that share simple, easy-to-follow recipes, highlighting it as a basic sweet snack.\n\n## Frying medium\nThe type of oil used to fry sel roti affects its quality. A 2017 study found that ghee led to the highest fat absorption, while refined soybean oil was the best overall choice for physical and chemical quality. Ghee gave the best taste, but soybean and sunflower oils are cheaper and easier to find, and soybean oil is healthier because it has essential fatty acids.\n\n## Occasions and variations\nSel roti is a special-occasion dish made mainly for the Nepali celebration of the Dashain and Tihar festivals. It is unique to Nepal and is made and served throughout the country during festivals as well as wedding parties and other ceremonies.\nIt is also a traditional food in Nepali-speaking communities in Darjeeling, Sikkim, Siliguri and Kalimpong regions of India and southern Bhutan. It is an essential food at most Nepalese and Kumaoni cultural and traditional events. Instead of the traditional single-ring shape, sel roti is made in a double-ring shape in the Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong areas.\nSinghal, a dish from the Kumaon region in the Uttarakhand state of India, is similar to sel roti, but while sel roti is made from rice flour, singhal is prepared from semolina flour.\n\n## Nutritional value\nTraditional sel roti is a very rich dish, primarily because it is made from rice flour and sugar and then deep-fried. This preparation process results in a high calorie content, fat (around 27% crude fat), and carbohydrates (about 66%), providing roughly 534 kcal per 100 g, but the dish is notably low in protein, fiber, and essential minerals like iron and calcium. To improve its nutritional quality, a 2021 study demonstrated that substituting 10% of the rice flour with roasted soy flour significantly boosted the levels of protein, fiber, iron, and calcium. Importantly, participants who tasted this modified sel roti actually preferred it, giving it better scores for its appearance, flavor, texture, and overall acceptance compared to the standard recipe.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nList of doughnut varieties\nList of fried dough varieties\n Food portal\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Selroti at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Seychellois cuisine\n\nSeychellois cuisine is the cuisine of the Republic of Seychelles, an archipelago country consisting of 115 islands off the Indian Ocean coast of Africa. Fish plays a prominent part in the country's cuisine because of its location in the Indian Ocean. Seychellois cuisine has been influenced by African, British, French, Spanish, Indian and Chinese cuisines.\n\n## History\nThe Seychelles archipelago had no permanent inhabitants before 1770, when they were settled by the French. They were transferred to the British in 1814, under the Treaty of Paris. In the early colonial years, sugarcane and other labour-intensive crops dominated the islands, farmed by enslaved people. After slavery was abolished in 1835, coconuts became the dominant crop on the islands, coconuts also came to dominate the local cuisine.\nThe Seychelles' location as a trading post added further ingredients and traditions to the local food. Malagasy slaves from Madagascar brought ancient Austronesian cooking methods, and Chinese and Indian merchants brought spices and fruits that round out modern coconut curries. The cuisine that emerged from this mixing pot is locally known as Creole cuisine, reflecting its complex origin.\n\n## Common ingredients\nSeychellois dishes are often based around seafood, including fish, shellfish, and octopus, coupled with rice. Fish dishes are cooked in several ways, such as steamed, grilled, wrapped in banana leaves, baked, salted and smoked. Additional food staples include shark, breadfruit, and mangoes.\nCurries (kari in Seychelles Creole) are a particularly common style of meal. Fish or octopus curries are traditional dishes. Other meats are cooked into curries as well, including chicken and fruit bat. Coconut milk is a common ingredient, due in part to the extensive coconut plantations of the colonial era. \nThe spices of Seychellois cuisine are a mix of Indian, European, Asian, and African, reflecting the islands' location and trading history. Ginger, lemongrass, coriander and tamarind are common spices. Curry powder, curry leaves, cinnamon bark, and even cinnamon leaves can all be included in dishes.\nDishes are often cooked with, or accompanied by, local Seychellois chili sauces, known as lasos piman.\nFresh fish and fruits are sold by street vendors and in markets. Because of the small size and population of the islands, the set of available fresh ingredients can be variable.\n\n## Common foods and dishes\nExample dishes include:\n\nCurries\nkari koko - Coconut curry, made with various proteins\nkari bernik - limpet curry\nFish curry\nDhal (lentils)\nSaffron rice\nLadob is eaten either as a savoury dish or as a dessert. The dessert version usually consists of ripe plantain and sweet potatoes (but may also include cassava, breadfruit or even corosol) boiled with coconut milk, sugar, nutmeg and vanilla in the form of a pod until the fruit is soft and the sauce is creamy. The savoury dish usually includes salted fish, cooked in a similar fashion to the dessert version, with plantain, kasava and breadfruit, but with salt used in place of sugar (and omitting vanilla).\nSatini reken—Shark chutney typically consists of boiled skinned shark, finely mashed, and cooked with squeezed bilenbi juice and lime. It is mixed with sautéed onion and spices.\nrougail saucisse (or sosis rougay) - sausages in tomato/onion sauce\nBouyon bred—fish soup, made with greens, related to French bouillabaisse\nBourzwa griye—grilled red snapper\nCassava pudding and cakes\nKat-kat banane—green bananas and fish cooked in coconut milk\nSalad palmis—palm heart salad, prepared with coconut palm\n\n## Beverages\nCoconut water and fresh juices are some of the beverages in Seychellois cuisine. Alcoholic drinks include the palm wine calou (or kalou), bakka rum and beers produced in the country such as Seybrew and Eku. Wine is obtainable at most Seychelles restaurants.\n\n## Food industry\nThe Indian Ocean Tuna company's processing plant is one of the largest tuna canneries in the world. It is located in Victoria, Seychelles.\n\n## See also\n\nAfrican cuisine\nIndex of Seychelles-related articles\n\n\n== References ==",

They are also served along with sheer khurma during the celebrations of the Islamic festival of Eid.\n\n## Preparation\nShami kababs are boiled or sauteed meat (beef or lamb) and chickpeas (chana daal) with whole hot spices (garam masala, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves), whole ginger, whole garlic and some salt to taste until completely tender. Onions, turmeric, chili powder, egg, chopped green coriander, chopped green chillies and chopped mint leaves may be added in preparing kebab. Garam masala powder (ground spices) may be used in place of whole hot spices.\nThe cooked meat is then ground in such a way that it is fibrous and does not become a paste. It is then shaped into diamond or round patties and is shallow fried. The Kashmiri variation uses a proportion of 3 parts mutton to 1 part lentils (chana) and is cooked and then ground to a paste consistency before frying the patties to a brown outer crust while keeping the inner soft.\n\n## Serving\nShami kebabs may be served with roti along with ketchup, hot sauce, Schezwan sauce, chilli garlic sauce, raita or chutney. Before serving the kebabs, it is also common to dip them in a beaten egg mixture and double-fry them. They are also commonly eaten in Hyderabad with cooked rice.\n\n## Etymology\nThere are several etymological explanations behind the shami kebab. One explanation is that the name of the dish derives from the word shaam, which means \"dinner\" and \"night\" in Persian. It also means evening in Urdu. The name may also derive from the scent of an itr called shamama. The name shami kebab may also refer to Bilad al-Sham, the modern Syria, as many cooks from that region migrated to the wealthy Mughal Empire of South Asia during the Middle Ages.\n\n## See also\n\nAnda shami\nFrikadeller\nList of kebabs\nPakistani meat dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Sharbat (drink)\n\nSharbat (Persian: شربت, pronounced [ʃæɾˈbæt]; also transliterated or written as shorbot, šerbet, şerbet or sherbet) is a drink prepared from fruit or flower petals. It is a sweet cordial, and usually served chilled. It can be served in concentrated form and eaten with a spoon or diluted with water to create the drink. \nPopular sharbats are made of one or more of the following: basil seeds, rose water, fresh rose petals, sandalwood, bael, hibiscus, lemon, orange, mango, pineapple, grape, falsa (Grewia asiatica) and chia seeds.\nSharbat is common in homes of Iran, Armenia, Turkey, Bosnia, Arab world, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. It is also popular with Muslims when breaking their daily fasts during the month of Ramadan.\n\n## Etymology\nThe term comes from the Persian word sharbat (شربت), meaning a drink of sugar and water. This in turn came from the Arabic word shariba, \"to drink\". By the late Middle Ages, the Arabic word sharāb (شراب) had come to mean \"alcoholic beverage\" and the alternate form sharbāt (شربات) and its Persian and Turkish variations, sharbat (شربت), and şerbet respectively, took on the meaning of a sweet non-alcoholic beverage.\n\n## History\nIt is believed that sharbats originated in Iran (Persia). Several syrups are listed in the 11th-century Canon of Medicine by Persian writer Ibn Sīnā. In the 12th century, Persian book of Zakhireye Khwarazmshahi, Gorgani describes different types of Sharbats in Iran, including Ghoore, Anar, Sekanjebin, etc.\nThe first Western mention of sharbat is an Italian reference to something that Turks drink. The word enters Italian as sorbetto which becomes sorbet in French. In the 17th-century, England began importing \"sherbet powders\" made from dried fruit and flowers mixed with sugar. In the modern era sherbet powder is still popular in the UK. A contemporary English writer traveling in the Middle East wrote of \"sundry sherbets … some made of sugar and lemons, some of violets, and the like.\" When Europeans figured out how to freeze sherbet they began making sorbetto by adding fruit juices and flavorings to a frozen simple syrup base. In the US sherbet generally meant an ice milk, but recipes from early soda fountain manuals include ingredients like gelatin, beaten egg whites, cream, or milk.\nSharbat was traditionally made with cane juice, but in modern times it is commonly made at home with sugar and water. Lime is sometimes added to improve the texture and flavor of the sharbat. Honey is also commonly used as a sweetener. Sharbet comes in many flavors including lemon, pomegranate, quince, strawberry, cherry, orange, rose, orange blossom, tamarind, mulberry and violet. One sharbat recorded in the 19th-century cookbook by Friedrich Unger is called gülgülü tiryaki şerbet which means \"pink opium-eater's sherbet\".\n\n## Varieties\nTamarind sherbet is a popular non-alcoholic beverage in Muslim countries that is commonly prepared during Ramadan. In Turkey tamarind sherbet, called demirhindi şerbeti, might be flavored with cloves, cardamom, fresh ginger, a cinnamon stick, honey, sage and dried linden flowers. In Urdu, tamarind is called imli and is commonly paired with dried plums (aaloo bukhara).\nAlmond sherbet is probably of Persian origin and can be spiced with cardamom and kewra. Another version of almond sherbet is made with milk and saffron and musk melon seeds are sometimes added.\n\nWood apple sharbat can be flavored with salt, pepper and mentha or simply sugar and lemon juice. Called bael ka sharbat it is one of the most popular beverages in India and was discussed in the 1894 Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales. Another sharbat variation from India is made with powdered sandalwood (chandan) and sugared milk. Phalsa berries are another base for some varieties of south Asian sherbet. Some sour sharbet variations might make use of citrus fruits, tamarind, or amla berries. An Indian lemonade called nimbu pani is made with fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice with additional flavorings like ginger, mint, saffron, kewra or even crushed black pepper.\nVetiver sherbet (khus syrup) can be made by adding khus essence to sugar and water. The khus essence itself is made from the roots of vetiver grass. Vetiver sherbet can be used as a flavoring for milkshakes, lassi and other yogurt drinks, ice cream, Shirley Temples and other mixed beverages. It can also be used as a general purpose dessert topping.\nThe most common sharbat flavor is probably rose. Rose sharbat can be used as a topping for the milk pudding muhallebi. One Turkish method of making rose sharbat involves kneading fresh rose petals with a little citric acid or sugar to release their fragrance. (If sugar is used the petals are left in the fridge overnight and a small amount of lemon juice is added the following day.) This petal mixture is called gül mayası and can be added to a sharbat base of sugar and water to make a rose sharbat topping that can be used to flavor desserts like muhallebi, and other cookies and cakes.\n\n### Middle East\nMany Ottoman Muslims did not have a custom of consuming or serving alcoholic beverages, which contributed to the popularity of sherbet during the Middle Ages. Sherbet could take three forms: syrups, pastes called çevirme and tablets. Ottoman confectioners would create concentrated essences out of fresh ingredients that could be diluted to make sherbet. In modern times, sherbet production has declined but in some regions of Turkey syrups are still made. Pastes are rare and can only be found in speciality shops; most commercially available pastes today are limited to bergamot or mastic flavors. Tablets were a specialty item, even during Ottoman Times, made only by confectioner's in professional shops. To make the tablets, fruit juices and essential oils, like rose or cinnamon, were added to boiling sugared water and stirred against the sides of the pan until the sugar began to crystallize. Spices, ground nuts, and herbs might be added to the mixture, which was poured onto a large marble slab and allowed to set.\nIn the 19th-century Isaac Edrehi wrote about a shopkeep named Mustafa who made two types of beverages called sherbet and khoshâb:\n\nOne of the dainties on the happy mixture of which Hadjy Mustafa prides himself is khoshâb. This beverage, though nearly related to, must not be confounded with, sherbet. The latter is slightly acidulated, and in general made of fresh lemon, quince, orange or cherry juice, or of candied grapes, mulberries, and Damascus plums, squeezed or diluted in cold water, and thus drank at all hours. But the khoshâb (agreeable water) forms the termination of all orthodox dinners, and is composed of preserved fruits or syrups, such as Aidin pomegranates, Mardin plums, Damascus and Bokhara apricots, Rodosto peaches, Scala Nuova cherries, Beybek strawberries, Adrianople roses, tamarinds, and so forth.\"\nThe Ottoman writer Evliya Çelebi records that the Merchants of Khoshâb in Ottoman Egypt made khoshâb, which he calls \"a kind of sherbet\", from \"the juice of the most excellent fruits, such as apricots of Bokhara, plums of Mardin, pears of Azerbaijan, mulberries of Arabguir, grapes of Smyrna, sour cherries (aigriottes) of Rodosto, apples of Koja Ili, prunes of Temesvar, and peaches of Constantinople.\" According to this account the khoshâb is flavored with \"amber and musk\". He goes on to describe a different group of sherbet-merchants whose shops are decorated with \"many thousand cups and bowls of China and Fayence, which are filled with sherbet, made of rhubarb, roses, lemons, lotus, tamarinds and grapes.\"\nThe 15th-century Ottoman poem by Süleyman Çelebi wrote: \"As I burned with raging thirst, They handed me a glass of sherbet\" describing how the Islamic prophet Muhammad's mother was given a glass of sherbet while she was in labor. When a woman in Anatolia gives birth it is still customary to offer  a hot sherbet called lohusa şerbeti to guests.\nCommon sharbat flavors include tamarind, pomegranate, black mulberry, sour grape, licorice, morello cherry, rose, honey. One version uses fresh purple wisteria flowers. The petals are soaked in water for a full day and then strained through cheesecloth. The petals are bundled in the cheesecloth and their highly fragranced liquid is also squeezed into the bowl containing the scented water. Sugar is added and the sugared mixture is allowed to rest overnight.\nA simple sherbet of lemon, citric acid and water, without additional spices, is called nişan şerbeti or \"betrothal sherbet\" in Turkish and is traditionally served at engagement ceremonies. Some versions of lemon sherbet may be optionally flavored with honey and cloves. A similar sherbet flavored with cloves and lemon juice can also be made with fresh peaches. Green apple and cinnamon is another possible flavor combination. One recipe for \"Ottoman sherbet\" calls for sugared sour cherries, dried plums, golden raisins, fresh ginger, cloves, cinnamon sticks to be simmered together.\n\n### India\nSharbat was introduced to India by the Mughals in the 16th century. It was popularised in the Indian subcontinent by Babur, who sent for frequent loads of ice from the Himalayas to make a cool refreshing drink.\n\n### Algeria\nCherbet (Arabic: شربات), also known as or charbet mazhar, is a traditional Algerian drink. In Algerian weddings, the bride drinks a large quantity of this traditional beverage and then offers it to her female guests after the hammam ritual, along with brioche pastries called kâak bouchkara.\nIts origin comes from the Algiers region, specifically from the city of Algiers. Its name comes from Algerian Arabic and means \"drink made from orange blossom water.\nIt is a syrup made of water, fresh cinnamon, a large amount of orange blossom water, and sugar according to taste.\n\n### Indonesia\nAn Indonesian, especially Javanese, drink called serbat is commonly found during the month of Ramadan. The most popular is made by mixing cold water, simple syrup, and shredded cantaloupe, popularly known as serbat blewah or cantaloupe sherbet.\n\n## See also\nRooh Afza\nSmoothie\nSquash (drink)\nSyrup\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nRossant, Juliette (September 2005), \"The World's First Soft Drink\", Aramco World, vol. 56, no. 5, retrieved 22 August 2020.

Meanwhile, in Islamic dietary law, the Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali and Ja'fari schools allow the eating of shrimp, while the Hanafi school does not.\n\n## Nutrition\nAs with other seafood, crustacea are high in protein but low in food energy. A shrimp-based meal is also a significant source of cholesterol, from 122 mg to 251 mg per 100 g of shrimp, depending on the method of preparation. Shrimp consumption, however, is considered healthy for the circulatory system because the lack of significant levels of saturated fat in shrimp means that the high cholesterol content in shrimp actually improves the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and lowers triglycerides.\nPrawns are high in levels of omega-3s (generally beneficial) and low in levels of toxic mercury, with an FDA study in 2010 showing a level of 0.001 parts per million analysing only methylmercury.\n\n## Preparation\nPreparing for consumption the smaller shrimp is done just by shelling, whereas for the larger prawns usually involves removing the head, shell, tail, and \"sand vein\".  A notable exception is drunken shrimp, a dish using freshwater shrimp that is often eaten alive, but immersed in ethanol to make consumption easier.\nTo shell a prawn, the tail is held while gently removing the shell around the body. The tail can be detached completely at this point, or left attached for presentation purposes. Although the head and shell are generally removed before consumption, they are edible when cooked. Much of the flavor of prawns comes from the shell, so it is preferable to cook them before shelling, otherwise by adding the shells to the cooking stock prior to straining or by flash cooking the shells in the pan to extract the \"juices\".\n\nRemoving the \"sand vein\" (a euphemism for the digestive tract) is referred to as \"deveining\". This can be removed by making a shallow cut lengthwise down the outer curve of the prawn's body, allowing the dark ribbon-like gut to be removed with a pointed utensil. Special deveining tools are sometimes used, but knives, skewers, and even toothpicks can be used to devein. Alternatively, if the tail has been detached, the gut can be pinched at the tail end and pulled out completely with the fingers. On large prawns, the \"blood vein\" (a euphemism for the ventral nerve cord) along the inner curve of its body is typically removed as well. It is then rinsed under cold running water. Removing these \"veins\" is not essential, as it is not poisonous and is mostly tasteless. Deveining does slightly change the flavor and makes it more consistent. Shrimp also sometimes consume small amounts of sand and so the vein might be gritty.\n\nRecipes using shrimp form part of the cuisine of many cultures. Strictly speaking, dishes containing scampi should be made from the Norway lobster, also called Dublin Bay prawn or langoustine in French — a crustacean c.10 centimetres (4 inches) long, more closely related to the lobster than shrimp — though in some places it is quite common for other prawns to be used instead.\nShrimp and prawns are versatile ingredients. Common methods of preparation include baking, boiling, frying, grilling, and barbequing. They are as delicate as eggs with regard to cooking time. Either cook them quickly, at a high heat for a very short time or else at a low cooking temperature for a long time, or if mixed into a dish, then added close to the end of cooking. When they are overcooked, they have a tough and rubbery texture.\nWet shrimp is commonly used as a flavoring and as a soup base in many Asian cuisines with shrimp curry being very popular in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Other recipes include bagoong, okonomiyaki, and poon choi. In the subject of Japanese sushi, shrimp has long been valued as the \"king of sushi-dane\", as its composition can be either raw or cooked, and its latter preparation has often been considered a good introduction or choice for those unfamiliar to eating sushi, especially dishes involving raw fish. In North America, fried shrimp is popular, as is jambalaya in the southern States. Shrimp are also found in Latin American and Caribbean dishes such as enchiladas and coconut shrimp. In Europe, prawns and especially langoustines are very popular, forming a necessary ingredient in Italian cacciucco, Portuguese caldeirada, Spanish paella de marisco, and many other seafood dishes. Prawns are also consumed as salad, by frying, with rice, and as shrimp guvec — a dish baked in a clay pot — on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.\nAlso, shrimps are fermented into shrimp paste and prawn sauce condiments in southeast Asia and China.\n\n## Substitutes\nSeveral alternatives have emerged, fostered by environmental and welfare concerns regarding the fishing and farming of shrimps. Plant-based alternatives often have soy or seitan as a main ingredient. They may also use konjac for the texture, and various other ingredients like seaweed.\n\n## Marketing\nShrimp are marketed and commercialized with several issues in mind. Most shrimp are sold frozen and marketed based on their categorization of presentation, grading, colour and uniformity.\n\n## Prawn dishes\nMany various dishes are prepared using shrimp as a primary ingredient.\nEbiko, or shrimp roe, sometimes translated as \"shrimp flakes\", is used as an ingredient in the preparation of sushi. There also exist popcorn shrimp, garlic butter shrimp, and breaded or battered deep-fried small shrimp.\n\n## Fraud\n\n\n### Gel-injection adulteration\nThere is a growing food fraud concern in Asia–Pacific where non-food grade gels are injected into shrimp and prawns to increase their weight and visual appeal. Three grams of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) can be used to make 50 kilograms of gel, which can be used for one tonne of shrimp. In 2022, Cambodia seized 7 tons of shrimp that had been injected with CMC gel.\n\n### Laboratory testing\nTo combat food fraud, NIST offers Standard Reference Materials: Wild-caught Shrimp (RM 8258) and Aquacultured Shrimp (RM 8259) for testing.\n\n## See also\nCrayfish as food\nCulinary name\nEating live seafood\nFish as food\nPain in crustaceans\nSeafood\nShrimp fishery\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Shrimps or prawns as food at Wikimedia Commons\n Shrimp at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject",

    "text": "# Sikkimese cuisine\n\nSikkimese cuisine is a collection of dishes representative of the Indigenous peoples of Sikkim. Rice is the staple food. Millet and fermented foods traditionally constituted a significant portion of the cuisine.\nNepalese cuisine is popular, as Sikkim is the only state of India with an ethnic Nepali majority. Many restaurants in Sikkim serve various types of Nepalese cuisine, such as the Limbu, Newa and Thakali cuisines. Tibetan cuisine has also influenced Sikkimese cuisine.\n\n## Influences\n\n\n### Communities\nThe Lepchas and Limbus are the earliest inhabitants of Sikkim who probably arrived in the 13th century CE. The Bhutia people from Tibet arrived later and established the Kingdom of Sikkim. During the British colonial rule in India, labourers from Nepal were encouraged to settle in the state. For many decades now, they have become the largest ethnic group in Sikkim. The British also encouraged Marwaris and Biharis to settle for trade and labour. The cuisine of these communities, with variations to incorporate local realities and availability, is considered Sikkimese cuisine.\n\n### Ecology\nSikkim is part of the Eastern Himalayas Biodiversity hotspot.  \n\nTraditional cuisines of the Lepcha, Limbu, Magar, and Bhutia peoples in the state incorporate the rich biodiversity of the region. The Buddhist saint Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rinpoche, who passed through ancient Sikkim in the eighth century noted the rich produce of the place in his writings, There are about 155 varieties of fruits with different tastes and nutritional values. [These include] a walnut that tastes like butter; a fruit known as wallay … and a grape with the taste of wine. There are fruits called tingding with the taste of meat, and sedey, which can be eaten as the equivalent of an entire meal; turnips, and thirty-seven other types of root vegetables are available. There are twenty different varieties of garlic. Altogether, among the edible plants, there are 360 varieties available. There are wild radishes, along with tsolay, nyolay, and grapes in the valley. In the trees, among the rocks and hanging from the cliffs there are beehives.Sikkim is also part of the Kangchenjunga Landscape which spreads from Nepal, India to Bhutan.\n\n### Trade\nSikkim lied on the ancient Silk Road connecting China via Tibet. Centuries of inter-kingdom trade relations and commerce, migration, and political annexation emerging from the road has influence the state's cuisine. British colonial and Indian post-colonial culture has also influenced local food cultures.\n\n## Agriculture\nThe geography and modes of food production within Sikkim inform the food culture within the state. The economy of Sikkim is largely agrarian. Due to the state's mountainous terrain, much of the land is unsuitable for farming, so terrace farming, particularly of rice, is common. In addition to rice, other cereal crops cultivated in Sikkim include wheat, maize, barley, and millet. Potatoes, ginger, oranges, tea, and cardamom are also cultivated. Sikkim produces the most cardamom  of any Indian state, about 4200 tons annually. Vegetables commonly grown include tomatoes, broccoli, and iskus.\nAlthough dairy and, to a lesser extent, meat and egg products are common elements of the Sikkimese diet, livestock primarily plays a subsidiary role in Sikkim's agricultural sector. Cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and yaks are raised. 11.7% of people in the rural areas of Sikkim are vegetarian.\nIn 2016, Sikkim became India's first \"organic state\" after fully converting its agricultural land to sustainable farming practices.\n\n## Fermented foods and common dishes\nFermented foods are an integral part of Sikkimese cuisine, comprising 12.6% of total food consumption in the state. Polling indicates that 67.7% of Sikkimese people prepare fermented foods at home rather than purchasing them. This suggests that most fermentation is done at the household level with the notable exceptions of chhurpi and marchaa (a starter culture for fermentation), which are purchased in markets.\nVarious fermented alcoholic beverages are produced by the introduction of marchaa to cereal grain and subsequent saccharification and fermentation in an airtight vessel. Millet, rice, and maize are commonly used. The grain is washed, cooked, combined with marchaa, then saccharified in an earthware pot for about 1–2 days, then fermented for 2–8 days. Examples of traditional fermented foods are kinema, gundruk, sinki, maseura, and khalpi. Traditional fermented beverages include chyang, tongba, raksi, and kodo ko jaanr.\n\n### Dishes\nSikkimese meals typically follow a bhat-dal-tharkari-achar (rice-pulses-curry-pickle) pattern.\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nSikkimese cuisine\nRecipes Archived 17 May 2018 at the Wayback Machine",

Sindhi cuisine has been influenced by Central Asian, Iranian, Mughal food traditions. It is mostly a non-vegetarian cuisine, with even Sindhi Hindus widely accepting of meat consumption.

People from different communities often eat together, while being mindful of each other's culture and choosing food that is acceptable for all.\nIn addition to venues serving traditional Singaporean food, restaurants serving cuisine from a diverse range of countries worldwide are also common in Singapore.\n\n## History\nEver since Singapore was established as a British port in 1819, Singaporean cuisine has been influenced by different cultures due to its position as an international shipping port. It is geographically located in between the Pacific and Indian oceans and it has the shape of a peninsula and an island at the same time, where various cultures and trades used to and continue to occur. Singapore's geographical position is surrounded by various Asian countries, hence there is much diversity in food and culture. Indonesia is located to the south, while Thailand, China, the Philippines and Malaysia are located to the north, and India is located to the west. \nThe culture of Singapore is made up of diverse influences from different continents and countries. Hence, the Singapore cuisine can be said to be culturally enriched. Singaporean cuisine has also been influenced by its colonial history, as it established as a British colony from the early 19th century until the mid-20th century when it became part of Malaysia before becoming independent; Singapore was also occupied by Imperial Japan during the Second World War.\n\nIt is believed that certain dishes that are part of Singaporean cuisine today predates the arrival of Raffles in 1819; some of these dishes include laksa, biryani and betel quid. However, it is unknown when these dishes arrived in Singapore, as historical records on them are largely scattered and inaccurate as these dishes were largely made by early Singapore immigrants at home and not served in an establishment. Adaptation of various dishes that were prepared by early Singapore immigrants to suit the ingredients and taste preferences were how some of the dishes were created; some examples of such dishes are fish head curry, kaya toast and Hainanese chicken rice, which are culinary staples in Singaporean cuisine today.\n\n### Hawker centres\nA large part of Singaporean cuisine revolves around hawker centres, where hawker stalls were first set up around the mid-19th century, and were largely street food stalls selling a large variety of foods These street vendors usually set up stalls by the side of the streets with pushcarts or bicycles and served cheap and fast foods to coolies, office workers and those that did not cook at home. Although the street vendors provided early Singapore immigrants with cheap and fast meals, these stalls were unhygienic, due to the lack of supporting infrastructure such as waste disposal and a steady supply of fresh water, and limited sanitation practices. Starting in the 1960s, the Singapore government began enforcing more rules and regulations for street hawkers, and relocated these vendors to more permanent locations with the construction of wet markets and hawker centres across the country.\nToday, when dining out, Singaporeans often eat at hawker centres, coffee shops or food courts rather than restaurants, due to convenience, a wider range of options and affordability. Hawker centres are widespread and offer affordable food. They usually feature dozens of stalls in a single complex, with each stall offering its own speciality dishes. Well-known hawker centres among tourists include Telok Ayer Market, Maxwell Food Center, Lau Pa Sat and Newton Food Centre. Coffee shops are non-air-conditioned versions of food courts and are commonly found island-wide, usually at the bottom of blocks of HDB flats. Hawker centres, or open-air food courts, have come to define Singaporean food culture. Popular markets like Old Airport Road Food Centre in Geylang, Golden Mile Food Centre on Beach Road and Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown offer the best of Chinese, Malay and Indian cooking, melded into foods that are uniquely Singaporean. Some well-known Singaporean hawker or kopitiam dishes includes kaya toast, chilli crab, fish head curry, laksa, roti prata and Hainanese chicken rice, which is widely considered to be one of Singapore's national dishes.\nIn 2016, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle became the first two street food locations in the world to be awarded a Michelin star. The former also gained the title of the world's \"cheapest Michelin-starred meal\".\nIn 2018, Singapore hawker culture was nominated by Singapore's National Heritage Board (NHB), National Environment Agency and Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore for inscription into UNESCO's Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The nomination was submitted in March 2019 and approved and inscribed on 16 December 2020. UNESCO described the hawker centre as \"‘community dining rooms’ where people from diverse backgrounds gather and share the experience of dining over breakfast, lunch and dinner.\"\n\n## Food culture\nA common greeting for many Singaporean comes in the form of the question \"Have you eaten?\", and its equivalent in various Chinese languages. It is one way of expressing a greeting to another person. It is also possible to assume that this is how Singaporeans think about meals and food. Since Singapore is a multicultural nation, there is a diverse range of people who might have different and restricted diets, such as Muslims and Hindus. Since Singapore is influenced by many different regions, religions, and cultures, there are also many events or anniversaries. During the Lunar New Year, people eat nian gao, which is originally from China, and is traditionally eaten around the Chinese New Year. It is an extension of Malay cuisine but influenced by the Chinese and Indians – not to mention the Arabs, British and other immigrants who have contributed to making Singapore one of the world's most important trading ports.\n\n## Singapore food internationally\nSingaporean food is a significant cultural attraction for tourists and visitors. Some Singaporean dishes have become internationally known. In 2011, four Singaporean dishes were included in the list of 'World's 50 Most Delicious Foods (Readers' Pick)' – a worldwide online poll by 35,000 people held by CNN International. They are Hainanese chicken rice (13th), chili crab (29th), Katong laksa (44th) and roti prata (45th).\nAnthony Bourdain brought international attention to local food available in hawker centres on his show, No Reservations. He featured Tian Tian Chicken Rice and Maxwell Food Centre on the programme. Bourdain also publicly spoke about hoping to feature four Singaporean dishes in his upcoming food hall in New York City.\nGordon Ramsay participated in a 'Hawker Heroes Challenge' held in Singapore in 2013, in which each competitor made three dishes. Ramsay's chili crab was voted the best, but he lost on the other two dishes to Ryan Koh (representing 328 Katong Laksa) and Foo Kui Lian (representing Tian Tian Chicken Rice).\nSingaporean cuisine has been promoted as a tourist attraction by the Singapore Tourism Board. The Singapore Food Festival, held every year in July, is a celebration of Singapore's cuisine. The Overseas Singaporean Unit also organises Singapore Day in major cities around the world as a platform for Singaporeans living abroad. One of Singapore Day's major draws is the local Singaporean hawker food, which is prepared on-site by well-known hawkers specially flown in for the event.\n\n## Types of food\nSingaporean food can be divided into six types: meat, seafood, rice, noodles, dessert and snacks.\nSingapore is especially renowned for its seafood. Chilli crab and black pepper crab are two quintessential dishes that dominate the scene and are greatly recommended to tourists.  Another favourite is sambal stingray.\nIn the meat category, Hainanese chicken rice is the most popular dish. Essentially, it is rice cooked with chicken fat, served with steamed chicken, accompanied with chilli sauce and cucumbers. \nThree noodle dishes stand out in Singapore cuisine. \"Hokkien prawn mee\" comprises fried egg noodles and Rice noodles with prawns, sliced pork, Fishcake and squid. It is stir-fried with a broth usually made from prawns. \"Nyonya laksa\" is composed of rice noodles served in a coconut prawn broth. \"Char kway teow\" is stir-fried rice noodles with prawns, Chinese sausage, Bean sprout, Lard and cockles.\nIn the dessert category, tau-suan is one of many types of desserts commonly found in hawker centres around Singapore. Tāu-suàn (split mung bean soup), is a dessert of Teochew origin. It is a sweet and starchy soup made from split mung beans, usually eaten with youtiao.\nIn the snack category, kaya toast is the representative dish, primarily due to the use of kaya. \"Kaya kopitiams\" are a common sight on the island. These affordable coffee shops dish out bread toasts, spread with coconut egg jam and butter, served with coffee and tea as well as two soft boiled eggs.\n\n## Common dishes and snacks\n\n\n### Chinese-inspired\nThe dishes that comprise \"Singaporean Chinese cuisine\" today were originally brought to Singapore by the early southern Chinese immigrants (Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hakka and Hainanese). They were then adapted to suit the local availability of ingredients, while absorbing influences from Malay, Indian and other cooking traditions.\nMost of the names of Chinese-originated Singaporean dishes were derived from languages and dialects of southern China, Hokkien (Min Nan) being the most common. As there was no common system for transliterating these Sinitic languages and dialects into the Latin alphabet, it is common to see different variants on the same name for a single dish. For example, bah kut teh may also be spelt bak kut teh, and char kway tiao may also be spelt char kuay teow.\n\nBak kut teh (肉骨茶; ròu gǔ chá), pork rib soup made with a variety of Chinese herbs and spices.

It is frequently seen in hawker centers and restaurants, often eaten as an appetizer or snack.\n\n### Malay and Indonesian\nSituated between Malaysia and Indonesia, Singaporean Malay dishes are influenced by the food of the neighbouring Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and the Riau Islands. Despite absorbing regional influences, it tends to be adapted to local tastes and differs from their counterparts in neighbouring countries. Although Malays, such as the Orang Laut, are native to Singapore, most Malays in Singapore today are descended from native Indonesians or native Malays from present-day Malaysia. Hence, Singaporean Malay cuisine features a unique set of influences, especially from Minang cuisine. Spices and coconut milk are common ingredients, although Chinese ingredients such as taupok (tofu puffs) and tofu (known as tauhu in Malay) have been integrated. Many Chinese and Tamil Muslim adaptations of the following dishes also exist.

These carts carry a variety of flavours, including but not limited to vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, coffee, sweet corn, coconut, and durian. While some vendors sell their ice cream in cups or cones, as is common in the West, the more popular variant is on slices of bread or between wafers.

Variations include Teh halia tarik, which uses ginger tea instead of black tea.\nTeh halia tarik, ginger tea with \"pulled\" milk (tarik)\nSingapore sling. While the cocktail was invented in Singapore's Raffles Hotel, and is still served at the hotel's Long Bar, it is not common in most Singaporean bars.\n\n## Singaporean dishes uncommon in Singapore\nSingapore-style noodles (星州炒米粉; xīng zhōu chǎo mí fěn), an American Chinese dish featuring fried rice vermicelli flavoured with yellow curry powder which can also be commonly found in Hong Kong, is not found in Singapore. The close relative to this dish is fried bee hoon (thin rice noodles).\nSingapore fried kway tiao (星州炒粿条; xīng zhōu chǎo guǒ tiáo), a dish featuring fried thick, flat rice noodles flavoured with dark soy sauce commonly available in some Chinese restaurants in Canada and the United States, is also not a Singaporean dish. The dish most resembling it is char kway teow.\n\n## See also\n\nCulture of Singapore\nGastronomy in Singapore\nList of coffeehouse chains\nList of chicken restaurants\nList of countries with organic agriculture regulation\nList of shopping malls in Singapore\nList of supermarket chains in Singapore\nList of vegetarian restaurants\nList of restaurants in Singapore\nList of Singaporean dishes\nJL Studio\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Sinki (food)\n\nSinki (Nepali: सिन्की) is a Nepali preserved fermented vegetable, similar to gundruk. Gundruk is prepared from leafy vegetables but sinki is prepared from radish tap roots. \nTo make this generations-old indigenous dish, aged radish slivers are pressed into a hole lined with bamboo and straw, then coffined by a cover of vegetation, rocks, wood and, finally, mud. After a month of bacterial curing, the resulting preserved vegetable is dried in the sun and stored to last a few years or more.\n\n## Processing and preparation\nThe process making sinki starts by allowing the radishes to wilt for a few days. Then the leafy tops are cut off and the radish tap-root sections are shredded. If there is a large amount of radishes to process, rather than shredding by hand, a dhiki is usually used to break them up. If the sinki will be made into a pickle after fermentation, instead of shredding, the radish is just cut up.  Meanwhile, a 2– to 3–foot (0.6– to 0.9-metre) hole is dug, and a small fire is built at the bottom just before the storage period begins to warm it up.\nAfter the hole is hot enough, the fire is extinguished and the bottom is lined with bamboo and straw. On top of this goes the radishes, which are then pressed down firmly with more vegetation, boards, rocks and mud to create a mostly air-tight barrier. It takes twenty to thirty days for the sinki to properly ferment by a series of lactic acids.  Then finally, before it can be eaten, the sinki is dried in the sun.\n\n## Consumption\nA common dish that utilizes sinki is a simple soup made by first soaking the fermented radishes in water for about 10 minutes, while chopped vegetables like onion, tomato and chili peppers are sauteed in oil with the strained radish slivers, with just a little salt and turmeric powder. This soup, which is commonly served with white rice, is made by adding water and cooking the vegetables for another 10 minutes until all the ingredients are fully tender.\nSinki is also consumed as a pickle. To prepare the pickle, the sinki is not dried. Instead it is directly mixed with spices and bottled.\n\n## Benefits\nSinki is considered good for digestion and helps to cure diarrhea and stomach pains.\n\n## In folk culture\n\n\n## See also\nMasaura\nKinema\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\nGundruk and Sinki: The Art of Fermenting Vegetables in Nepal",

    "text": "# Somali cuisine\n\nSomali cuisine is characterized by a blend of Somali, East African, Arab, Indian and Italian culinary infusions in the cuisine. As a nomadic pastoralist culture, traditional Somali cuisine relies on milk and meat. Many dishes have been influenced by its nomadic culture, colonialism, trade and its proximity to the Indian Ocean. The use of spices reflect these elements and plays a role in Somali cuisine. Somali culinary traditions have gained increasing international recognition, with Somali-American chefs such as Ifrah Ahmed and Hawa Hassan drawing significant attention, a Somali restaurantaur earning a Best Small Business Person in the United States, and London establishments like Al Kahf and Sabiib emerging as popular destinations among food enthusiasts.\nSome notable Somali specialties include kimis/sabaayad, canjeero/laxoox, xalwo (halwa), sambuusa (samosa), bariis iskukaris, and muqmad/oodkac.\nPork consumption is forbidden in Somalia in accordance with sharia, as the vast majority of the population are Muslims. Meats such as beef, goat, lamb, camel, and fish, are always prepared halal.\n\n## Breakfast\nBreakfast (quraac) is an important meal for Somalis, who often start the day with Somali-style tea (shaah/shaax) or coffee (qahwa). The tea, brewed from black tea leaves, can be served regularly as-is (shaah rinji or shaah bigays). It can be also flavoured with spices such as ginger, cardamom and cinnamon (though black pepper is not used, unlike other spiced teas), while milk is added after the brewing instead of during it; this is known as shaah cadeeys.\nThe main dish is typically a pancake-like bread called a canjeero or laxoox eaten in somalia  and is eaten in different ways. It is often eaten along with honey and ghee, olive oil, or sesame oil, and washed down with a cup of tea. It may also be broken into small pieces with Somali ghee (subag) and sugar. For children, it is mixed with tea and sesame oil or olive oil (macsaro) until mushy. Typically, there is a side dish of liver (usually beef), goat meat (hilib ari), diced beef and sometimes kidneys (kiliyo) cooked in a bed of soup (suqaar), or oodkac / muqmad, which consists of small dried pieces of beef, goat or camel meat, boiled in ghee.  Different from Ethiopian injera, Somali canjeero is smaller, thinner and sweeter. It might also be eaten with a stew (maraq) or soup.\n\nSabaayad or kimis / ceesh, is another type of flatbread. During lunch, kimis / sabaayad is sometimes consumed with a Somali curry, soup, or stew.\nMuufo is another type of Somali flatbread — characterised by its puffy and uniquely thick texture — popular within south Somalia and is usually eaten with stews and soup but is also sometimes eaten at breakfast with honey or sugar, subag, and black tea.\nMushaari or boorash (porridge), with butter, nuts and sugar, is eaten across Somalia.\nFul is a breakfast dish made from slow-cooked fava beans sautéed with aromatics like onions, garlic, and tomatoes, then seasoned with earthy cumin.\nNationally, a sweet, slightly greasy crepe-like flatbread known as malawax or malawah, is a staple of most home-cooked meals and is usually eaten for breakfast with tea, similarly to how canjeero is eaten.\n\n## Lunch\nLunch (qado) is often an elaborate main dish of laxoox, pasta (baasto) or rice (Bariis iskukaris) spiced with cumin (kamuun), cardamom (heyl), cloves (dhagayare), and sage (Salvia somalensis). The use of pasta (baasto), such as spaghetti, comes from the Italians, though it is frequently accompanied by a heavier stew than pasta sauce. As with the rice, it is often served with a banana.\nSpaghetti can also be served with rice, forming a novelty dish referred to as \"federation\". The dish is usually served with equal (whole) portions of rice and spaghetti, split on either side of a large oval plate. It is then layered with assorted stewed meats and vegetables, served with salad and an optional banana. It has been suggested that the name of the dish is derived from the union of two dishes in Somalia and also from the size and quantity of the food. It is more common to order the dish from traditional Somali restaurants, where both rice and spaghetti are always readily available; it is rare in Somali households to prepare both rice and pasta for the same meal.\nAnother popular dish is iskukaris, a hot pot (maraq) of rice, vegetables and meat, a national staple. Beyond the many styles of hot pot, rice is usually served with a banana on the side. In Mogadishu, steak (busteeki) and fish (kalluun/mallaay) are widely eaten.\nSouthern Somalis commonly consume a stiff cornmeal referred to as \"soor\", which is usually eaten alongside stews or soup.\nAnother commonly eaten cornmeal is eaten called asida. It is mashed with fresh milk, butter and sugar, or presented with a hole in the middle filled with maraq, or olive oil.\n\nA variation of flat bread is sabaayad/kimis/cesh. Like the rice, is served with maraq and meat on the side. The sabaayad of Somalia is often somewhat sweet, and is cooked in a little oil.\nPopular drinks at lunch are balbeelmo (grapefruit), raqey (tamarind) and isbarmuunto (lemonade). In Mogadishu, fiimto (Vimto) and laas (lassi) are also common. In the northwest, the preferred drinks are cambe (mango), guava, and tufaax (apple).\n\n## Dinner\nDinner (casho) in Somalia is served as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, dinnertime often follows Tarawih prayers, sometimes as late as 11 pm. Cambuulo, a common dinner dish, is made from well-cooked adzuki beans mixed with butter and sugar. The beans, which on their own are referred to as digir, can take up to five hours to finish cooking when left on the stove at a low temperature. Qamadi (wheat) is also used; cracked or uncracked, it is cooked and served just like the azuki beans.\nRooti iyo xalwo, slices of bread served with a gelatinous confection, is another dinner dish. Muufo, a variation of cornbread, is a dish made of maize and is baked in a tinaar (clay oven). It is eaten by cutting it into small pieces, topped with sesame oil (macsaro) and sugar, then mashed together with black tea.\nBefore sleeping, a glass of milk spiced with cardamom is often consumed.\n\n## Snacks\nSambuus, a Somali variation of the Desi samosa, is a triangular snack that is commonly eaten throughout Somalia during the afur (iftar). Kebab is a snack eaten in western Somalia. There are several varieties of this dish. For instance, it may be served on sticks or skewers with vegetables. Another common variety, consisting of minced meat mixed with egg and flour and then fried, is popular in south Somalia. It resembles kofta kebab. Other snacks include chicken and vegetable filled rolls and bajiyo, which is made from black-eyed peas or adzuki beans and usually served with spicy sauce. These, along with sambusas, are very popular not only during Ramadan, but also for special occasions such as weddings and family gatherings. Homemade chips are made with fresh potato and black pepper. Fruits such as mango (cambo), guava (seytuun), banana (moos), and orange (liinbanbeelmo) are eaten throughout the day.\n\n## Sweets\nXalwo or halwo (not comparable to the well-known halva) is a popular Benadiri snack confection served during special occasions, such as Eid celebrations or wedding receptions. Xalwo is made from sugar, cornstarch, cardamom powder, nutmeg powder, and ghee. Peanuts are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor. In the south there is a rice pudding called ruz bil laban.\nGashaato, kashaato or qumbe, made from coconut, sugar and oil, which is spiced with cardamom, is a much-loved sweet from Benadir. The sugar is brought to a boil with a bit of water, then the cardamom is added followed by shredded coconut.\nLows iyo sisin is a favorite sweet in the south. It consists of a mixture of peanuts (lows) and sesame seeds (sisin) in a bed of caramel. The confection sticks together to form a bar.\nJallaato, similar to the American ice pop, is made by freezing naturally sweet fruits with a stick in the middle. More recently in Mogadishu (Xamar), it has grown to include caano jallaato, which is made with milk and requires sugaring up. The word jallaato comes from gelato, which is Italian for \"frozen\".\nBuskut or buskud is also from the south comprises many types of cookies, including very soft ones called daardaar (literally \"touch-touch\" due to its smooth, delicate texture).\nDoolshe encompasses many styles of cakes.\nIcun is a sweet mostly eaten by southern Somalis. It is made from sugar and flour mixed with oil and is most frequently served at weddings and for Eid.\nShushumow is a fried Somali pastry with a crystallised shell which is usually made as a party snack.\nBasbousa is a traditional Somali sweet cake of Arab influence. It is made from cooked semolina or farina soaked in simple syrup.\nAlso in the north there is lokma, a sweet fried-dough pastry.\nBaklava is also eaten by some Somalis.\nThere are many sweets eaten during festive occasions, such as weddings, parties or Eid. Among these are baalbaaloow, shuushuumoow, bur hindi, bur tuug, and qumbe (coconut), the last of which is made from coconuts mixed with sugar to form a bar.\n\n## After-meal\nSomalis traditionally perfume their homes after meals. Frankincense (luubaan) or a prepared incense (uunsi) is placed on top of hot charcoal inside an incense burner or censer (a dabqaad) or idin. It then burns for about ten minutes. This keeps the house fragrant for hours. The burner is made from soapstone found in specific areas of Somalia.\n\n## See also\nSafari, the only Somali restaurant in New York City\nCuisine of the Horn of Africa\nArab cuisine\nList of African cuisines\n Africa portal\n Food portal\n Somalia portal\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\nAli, Barlin (2007).

    "text": "# South American cuisine\n\nSouth American cuisine has many influences, due to the ethnic fusion of South America. The most characteristic are Indigenous South American, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, African, and Indian-South Asian. However, there is a mix of European, North American, and indigenous cuisines. The customs and food products greatly vary according to the physically distinct regions.\n\n## Overview\nThe Amazon basin of South America provides a plethora of fresh fish and tropical fruits. The Pacific Ocean provides a large amount of seafood, such as king crab (typically caught at the southern end of the continent), lobster (found in great quantities from the Juan Fernández Islands), and Antarctic krill, which was recently discovered. Tuna and tropical fish are caught all around the continent but are notably found in abundance near Easter Island. \nThe many plains on this continent make it rich for growing foods like cereals, potatoes and quinoa. In the Patagonia region in the south of Argentina, many people raise sheep and cattle. In Brazil, a traditional dish is feijoada, a stew consisting of beans with beef and pork. Rice and beans is also very common in Brazil. \nPeruvian cuisine is largely influenced by traditional Incan culture (see Incan cuisine). The consumption of carne asada is widespread throughout much of the continent.  It is popular to grill in the open air as in asado or churrasco. \nShredded beef is common throughout South America and Latin America and is served with a variety of foods.\n\n## By region\n\n\n### Andes\nThe food of the Andes is highly influenced by the indigenous peoples. The principal foods continue to be corn, potatoes and other tubers. The meats most characteristic of this zone are the llama (Peru) and the guinea pig (Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and the Argentine northwest). In areas where there is fresh water, trout is consumed. \nChupe andino refers to various stews and soups that are prepared in the Andes mountains region. One of the most important drinks is chicha.  Important dishes include humitas, locro, chanfaina, arepas, quimbolitos (dessert tamales), and peppers. A famous dish from the Ecuadorian Andes is pachamanca. From the mixture of German, native cuisine, and the Chiloé Archipelago in the southern Andes comes valdiviano and curanto.\nThe wetter areas of Peru produce sugar cane, lemon, bananas, and oranges. Chancaca is popular as well as carbonara, sancocho, huevos quimbos, potato pie, and ch'arki.\n\n### Pampas\nThe pampas have the most Italian and Spanish influences. In Argentina, they are the center of the three typical Argentine dishes dulce de leche, asado (churrasco in Brazil), and milanesa. \nArgentine pizza is different from Italian pizza, being closer to calzones. Pasta and polenta are common in Argentina and on the Pampas generally. Empanadas and choripán are very popular fast food in Argentina and Uruguay. Churros, ensaïmada, alfajor, Spanish tortillas with potato, meatballs, sopa de mondongo, and puchero are Spanish-derived Pampas cuisine. Mate is popular on the Pampas.\n\n### Tropical\nThe tropical region of the continent is divided into two distinct areas, the coastal areas of the Atlantic and the Pacific and the Amazon area, each with its distinct cuisines. Much of the fruits that are considered to be exotic are common in the tropical forests and fields, such as guava, pineapple, papaya, mango, banana, and elderberry.\nThe climate and geography also favour a great variety of crops: potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, complemented with meat and fish; grains, principally rice, corn, and wheat and beans.\nIn the coastal area ceviche, tostones or patacón, arepa, chipa, sancocho, pabellón criollo, bandeja paisa, guatita, and sopa paraguaya are common dishes.\nIn Brazil, foods such as feijoada, arroz carreteiro (cart riders rice), coxinha, and farofa are common throughout the country. The Brazilian state of Bahia has its own cuisine which has heavy African influences.\nThe Amazon area is known for its utilization of native meats such as the capybara, turtles, peccary,  and paca. Common dishes are juane, tacacho, tacacá. There are a wide variety of fruits native to the Amazon with which a great variety of drinks are prepared.\n\n## Diffusion\n\n\n### Australia\nAs early as the 1950s, Latin American cuisine have been transported to the Southeast coast, where Sydney is. Now there is a slight selection of Latin American restaurants that has spread across the country.\n\n### United States\nEarly South American restaurants in the United States included Caso do Brazil in Reseda, California, which opened in 1955, and the Machu Picchu nightclub in Miami, Florida, which opened in 1963, serving Peruvian dishes such as ceviche and anticuchos. South American foods are increasingly imported into the United States, especially Brazilian foods such as guarana, guava paste, and cachaça (an ingredient in the caipirinha cocktail).\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nLatin American cuisine\nBrazilian cuisine\nArgentine cuisine\nChilean cuisine\nPeruvian cuisine\nIndigenous cuisine of South America\nChifa\n\n## Footnotes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nKijac, M.B.

    "text": "# South Asian cuisine\n\nSouth Asian cuisine includes the traditional cuisines from the modern-day South Asian republics of Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, also sometimes including the kingdom of Bhutan and the emirate of Afghanistan. Also sometimes known as Desi cuisine, it has been influenced by and also has influenced other Asian cuisines beyond the Indian subcontinent.\n\n## Staples and common ingredients\nChapati, a type of flat bread, is a common part of meals to be had in many parts of the Indian subcontinent. Other staples from many of the cuisines include rice, roti made from atta flour, and beans.\nFoods in this area of the world are flavoured with various types of chilli, black pepper, cloves, and other strong herbs and spices along with the flavoured butter ghee. Ginger is an ingredient that can be used in both savory and sweet recipes in cuisines from the subcontinent. Chopped ginger is fried with meat, and pickled ginger is often an accompaniment to boiled rice. Ginger juice and ginger boiled in syrup are used to make desserts. Turmeric and cumin are often used to make curries.\nCommon meats include goat, fish, chicken and beef. Beef is less common in India than in other South Asian cuisines because cattle have a special place in Hinduism. Prohibitions against beef extend to the meat of (water) buffalo and yaks to some extent. Lamb is common in certain regions but not always prominent. Pork is considered as a taboo food item by all Muslims and is not taboo but avoided by many Hindus, though it is commonly eaten in some regions like Northeast India and Goa. A variety of very sweet desserts which use dairy products is also found in cuisines of the Indian subcontinent. The main ingredients in desserts of the Indian subcontinent are reduced milk, ground almonds, lentil flour, ghee and sugar. Kheer is a dairy-based rice pudding, a common dessert.\n\n## History\nMany foods from the subcontinent have been known for over five thousand years. The Indus Valley people, who settled in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, hunted turtles and alligator. They also collected wild grains, herbs and plants. Many foods and ingredients from the Indus period (c. 3300–1700 B.C.) are still common today. Some consist of wheat, barley, rice, tamarind, eggplant, and cucumber. The Indus Valley people cooked with oils, ginger, salt, green peppers, and turmeric root, which would be dried and ground into an orange powder.\nIndians have used leafy vegetables, lentils, and milk products such as yogurt and ghee throughout their history. They also used spices such as cumin and coriander. Black pepper, which is native to India, was often used by 400 A.D. The Greeks brought saffron and the Chinese introduced tea. The Portuguese and British made red chili, potato and cauliflower popular after 1700 A.D. Mughals, who began arriving in India after 1200, saw food as an art and many of their dishes are cooked with as many as 25 spices. They also used rose water, cashews, raisins, and almonds.\nIn the late 18th and early 19th century, an autobiography of the Scottish Robert Lindsay mentions a Sylheti man called Saeed Ullah cooking a curry for Lindsay's family. This is possibly the oldest record of Indian cuisine in the United Kingdom.\n\n## By culture\n\n\n### Afghan cuisine\nAfghan cuisine is influenced by Persian, Central Asian, and Indian cuisines due to Afghanistan's close proximity and cultural ties. The cuisine is halal and mainly based on lamb, beef, and poultry with rice and Afghan bread.\n\n### Bangladeshi cuisine\nBangladeshi cuisine is dominated by Bengali cuisine and has been shaped by the diverse history and riverine geography of Bangladesh. The country has a tropical monsoon climate. Rice is the main staple food of Bangladeshi people and it is served with a wide range of curries.\n\n Bangladeshi dishes exhibit strong aromatic flavours; and often include eggs, potatoes, tomatoes and aubergines. A variety of spices and herbs, along with mustard oil and ghee, is used in Bangladeshi cooking. The main breads are naan, porota, roti, bakarkhani and luchi. Dal is the second most important staple food which is served with rice/porota/luchi. Fish is a staple in Bangladeshi cuisine, especially freshwater fish, which is a distinctive feature of the country's gastronomy. Major fish dishes include ilish (hilsa), pabda (butterfish), rui (rohu), pangash (pangas catfish), chitol (clown knifefish), magur (walking catfish), bhetki (barramundi) and tilapia. Meat consumption includes beef, goat, chicken, duck, and koel. Vegetable dishes, either mashed (bhorta), boiled (sabji), or leaf-based (saag), are widely served. Seafood such as lobster and shrimp are also often prevalent.\nIslamic dietary laws are prevalent across Bangladesh. Halal foods are food items that Muslims are allowed to eat and drink under Islamic dietary guidelines. The criteria specifies both what foods are allowed, and how the food must be prepared. The foods addressed are mostly types of meat allowed in Islam. Bangladeshi people follow certain rules and regulations while eating. It includes warm hospitality and particular ways of serving as well. This is known as Bangaliketa (Bengali: বাঙালি কেতা). The culture also defines the way to invite people to weddings and for dinner. Gifts are given on certain occasions. Bangaliketa also includes a way of serving utensils in a proper manner. Bengali cuisine has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.\n\n### Bhutanese cuisine\nBhutanese cuisine employs a lot of red rice (like brown rice in texture, but with a nutty taste, the only variety of rice that grows at high altitudes), buckwheat, and increasingly maize. The diet in the hills also includes chicken, yak meat, dried beef, pork, pork fat, and mutton. It has many similarities with Tibetan cuisine.\n\n### Indian cuisine\nIndian cuisine is characterized by its sophisticated and subtle use of many Indian spices. There is also the widespread practice of vegetarianism across its society although, overall a minority. Indian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse cuisines, each family of this cuisine is characterized by a wide assortment of dishes and cooking techniques. As a consequence, Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting its ethnically diverse demographics. India's religious beliefs and culture has played an influential role in the evolution of its cuisine. It has influences from Middle Eastern cuisine, Southeast Asian cuisine, East Asian cuisine and Central Asian cuisine, as well as the Mediterranean cuisines due to the historical and contemporary cross-cultural interactions with these neighboring regions.\nRegional cuisine includes:\n\nEast Indian cuisines:\nBengali cuisine\nCuisine of Chhattisgarh\nOdia cuisine\nBhojpuri cuisine\nJharkhandi cuisine\nMaithil cuisine\nBihari cuisine\n\nNortheast Indian cuisines:\nAssamese cuisine\nArunachalese cuisine\nMeghalayan cuisine\nManipuri cuisine\nNaga cuisine\nMizo cuisine\nSikkimese cuisine\nTripuri cuisine\nGorkha cuisine\n\nNorth Indian cuisines:\nAwadhi cuisine\nCuisine of Uttar Pradesh\nHimachali cuisine\nKashmiri cuisine\nKumaoni cuisine\nLadakhi cuisine\nMughlai cuisine\nPunjabi cuisine\nRajasthani cuisine\n\nSouth Indian cuisines:\nChettinad cuisine\nDhivehi cuisine (Minicoy)\nHyderabadi cuisine\nKerala cuisine\nKarnataka cuisine\nTamil cuisine\nTelugu cuisine\nThalassery cuisine\nUdupi cuisine\n\nWest Indian cuisines:\nGoan cuisine\nGujarati cuisine\nMaharashtrian cuisine\nMalvani cuisine\nParsi cuisine\nSindhi cuisine\nThathai Bhatia Cuisine\n\nOther Indian cuisines include:\nIndian Chinese cuisine\nJain vegetarianism\nIndian fast food\n\n### Maldivian cuisine\nMaldivian cuisine, also called Dhivehi cuisine, is the cuisine of the Nation of Maldives and of Minicoy, India. The traditional cuisine of Maldivians is based on three main items and their derivatives: coconuts, fish and starches.\n\n### Nepalese cuisine\nNepalese cuisine comprises a variety of cuisines based upon ethnicity, soil and climate relating to Nepal's cultural diversity and geography.Dal-bhat-tarkari (Nepali: दाल भात तरकारी) is eaten throughout Nepal. Nepali cuisine has significant influences from Neighboring Indian and Tibetan cuisines.\nNepalese cuisine includes:\n\nNewa cuisine\nTibetan cuisine\nMaithil cuisine\n\n### Pakistani cuisine\nPakistani cuisine (Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان) is part of the greater South Asian with significant influence from West Asian cuisines and Central Asian cuisines due to its geographic location and influence. As a result of Mughal legacy, Pakistan also mutually inherited many recipes and dishes from that era alongside India.\nRegional cuisines include:\n\nBalochi cuisine\nChitrali cuisine\nKalash cuisine\nLahori cuisine\nCuisine of Karachi\nPashtun cuisine\nPunjabi cuisine\nSaraiki cuisine\nSindhi cuisine\n\nOther Pakistani cuisine include:\n\nPakistani Chinese cuisine\nMughlai cuisine (Karachi)\nPakistani fast food\n\n### Sri Lankan cuisine\nSri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors.  Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Malay cuisine and South Indian cuisine are evident.\n\n## See also\nList of Asian cuisines\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# South Indian cuisine\n\nSouth Indian cuisine includes the cuisines of the five southern states of India— Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and the union territory of Lakshadweep. Sub-cuisines within these include Udupi, Chettinad, Hyderabadi, Thalassery, Saraswat, and Mangalorean Catholic. South Indian cuisine shares similarities with the cuisines of Sri Lanka and the Maldives due to a similar geographic location and culture.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Early culinary texts\nAccording to culinary historians K. T. Achaya and Ammini Ramachandran, the ancient Sangam literature dated from 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE offers early references to food and recipes in the Sangam era, whether a feast at king's palace, meals in towns and countryside, at hamlets in forests, pilgrimage and the rest-houses during travels. It describes cuisine of various landscapes and people who reside there, how they prepared food and what they served their guests. Poet Avvaiyar for example describes her hearty summer lunch as \"steamed rice, smoked and mashed aubergine and tangy frothy buttermilk\", while poet Mudathama Kanniyar describes \"Skewered goat meat, crispy fried vegetables, rice and over 16 varieties of dishes\" as part of the royal lunch he was treated to in the palace of the Chola king. Sangam literature offers references to food eaten on several different types of leaf platters and thalis with multiple bowls. Sangam period archeological sites like Tirunelveli has uncovered notable household bronzeware utensils including \"ornamental vase stands, bowls, jars and cups of different patterns with ornamental bowl lids\" which were likely used for thali presentation as described in Sangam texts.\nSeveral notable Indian cookbooks were written in southern India in the medieval period. These include Lokopakara (1025 CE), Manasollasa (1130 CE), Soopa Shastra (1508 CE), Bhojana Kutuhala (1675 CE), and Sivatattva Ratnakara (1699 CE). These cookbooks contains both vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisines, with exception of Soopa Shastra which is a Jain vegetarian cookbook.\n\n### Maritime trade\nIndian Ocean trade played an important role in the spread of Indian spices to the western world during the classical era. Black pepper is native to the Malabar Coast of India, while the Malabar pepper is extensively cultivated there. During the classical era, spices including black pepper, cinnamon, and cardamom, and fragrant woods like sandalwood and agarwood, were part of the Indo-Roman trade network from the ancient port of Muziris in the southwestern coast of India. During the Middle Ages prior to the Age of Discovery, which began at the end of the 15th century CE, the kingdom of Calicut (modern Kozhikode) on Malabar Coast was the centre of Indian pepper exports to the Red Sea and Europe, with Arab traders being particularly active. Tomatoes and chili peppers were introduced from Central America by the Portuguese following the Columbian exchange. \"English Vegetables\" such as cabbage, cauliflower, and turnip, as they were at one time termed, became part of local cuisine by late 1800s.\n\n## Cuisine\nSouth Indian cuisine is distinguished by multiple elements, one being the use of intense aromatic mixtures of spices, often extremely spicy hot, for curry dishes. These make use of roasted spices and aromatic herbs, the dishes made hot with chili and pepper, sometimes with coconut milk.\nAndhra Pradesh cuisine is hotly-spiced and often vegetarian, with seafood prominent along the coast; Kerala too has a range of seafood dishes from its coastline. The cuisine of Tamil Nadu is similarly mainly vegetarian, but even hotter. In Telangana, Hyderabadi cuisine is somewhat milder but subtle and full of flavour, making use of saffron, nuts, and dried fruits as well as warmer spices in dishes for the Nizams, the former rulers. A staple of Karnataka cuisine is jolada rotti, a flat unleavened bread made of sorghum flour. It is eaten with pulse curries, ennegayi (stuffed aubergine) and chutneys.\nThe cuisine of Lakshadweep is based on coconut, fish, and starches; a range of dishes employ oconut milk. Fish, especially tuna, is important in the cuisine; tuna meat is made into Rihaakuru, a thick brown fish sauce.  \nRice is a staple element in South Indian cuisine, served boiled or made into uttapam pancakes, dosas, or idli steamed cakes. Other characteristic ingredients include coconut oil for cooking and lentils for dal.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Spanish cuisine\n\nSpanish cuisine (Spanish: cocina española) consists of the traditions and practices of Spanish cooking. It features considerable regional diversity, with significant differences among the traditions of each of Spain's regional cuisines.\nOlive oil (of which Spain is the world's largest producer) is extensively used in Spanish cuisine. It forms the base of many vegetable sauces (known in Spanish as sofritos). Herbs most commonly used include parsley, oregano, rosemary and thyme. The use of garlic has been noted as common in Spanish cooking. The most-used meats in Spanish cuisine include chicken, pork, lamb and veal. Fish and seafood are also consumed on a regular basis. Tapas and pinchos are snacks and appetizers commonly served in bars and cafes.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Antiquity\nAuthors such as Strabo wrote about the aboriginal people of Spain using nuts and acorns as staple foods. The extension of vineyards along the Mediterranean seemed to be due to the colonization of Greeks and Phoenicians, who also introduced the production of olive oil. Spain became the largest producer of olive oil in the world. The growing of crops of the so-called tríada mediterránea (the \"Mediterranean triad\": wheat, grapes, and olives) underpinned the staple meal products for the inhabitants of the south of the Iberian Peninsula during the Roman Era (bread, wine and oil).\n\n### Middle Ages\nThe Visigoths' limited but lasting contributions to Spanish cuisine included the spread of the consumption of fermented milk and the preference for avoiding mixing water and wine.\nRice was possibly introduced for the first time by Byzantines in the Iberian Peninsula by the 6th century. After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century, Arabs expanded rice cultivation, bringing new irrigation techniques originally from the Indian subcontinent that also allowed for the cultivation of crops such as sugar cane, watermelon, lemon and oranges. Other ingredients possibly introduced in the Iberian Peninsula during the Hispano-Muslim period include sorghum, spinach, eggplant, peach, apricot and saffron. The most famous Spanish dish, paella, uses two ingredients that were probably popularized during the Al-Andalus period: rice and saffron.\n\nMoors also developed the basis for the art of pastry-making and introduced escabeche, a food preservation technique relying on vinegar. Dishes like ajo blanco, alboronía, alajú, hallulla, albóndigas, mojama, arrope, were some of the many legacies of Moorish cuisine. Although Muslim religion did not allow alcoholic drinks, the consumption of wine was widespread as the Qur'anic precepts never got to overrule the preexisting traditions. There are many accounts of the \"drinking chats\" of Abd al-Rahman II, Abd al-Rahman III and Almanzor.\nObserving the kashrut regulations, Jews and judaizantes opted for blood-drained meat without fat, outright rejecting bacon. Potajes were an important part of the Jewish cuisine in the Middle Ages, most notably adafina (a local name for a ḥamin dish) along with other Jewish culinary legacies in Spain. Almodrote (a formerly popular sauce preparation out of vogue since the late 17th century) was a Sephardic recipe in origin.\nThe history of cookbooks in Spain can be traced back to works such as the Llibre de Sent Soví (1324) and Ruperto de Nola's Llibre de Coch (1520), both written in the Catalan language. Other of the earliest cooking books in pre-modern Iberia are the Fiḍālat al-Jiwān fī Ṭayyibāt al-Ṭaʿām wa-l-Alwān by Murcia-born Ibn Razīn al-Tujībī and the anonymous Kitāb al-Ṭabikh fī al-Maghrib wa al-Andalus fī ʽAṣr al-Muwaḥḥidīn, li-muʽallif majhūl, written in Arabic.\n\n### Modern era\nThe arrival of Europeans in the Americas in 1492 initiated the advent of new culinary elements, such as tomatoes, potatoes, maize, bell peppers, spicy peppers, paprika, vanilla and cocoa. Spain was where chocolate was first mixed with sugar to temper its natural bitterness. Other ingredients traveled to the Americas, such as rice, grapes, olives, and many types of cereals.\nInfluenced by Arabic harisa, grain-based soups such as farinetes (along the Mediterranean coast) and, similarly, gachas (in the Central Plateau) were customary in Early Modern Spain.\nForeign visitors noted with disdain the Spaniards' use of olive oil and lard for cooking rather than their preferred butter. The latter was barely available and, according to the 17th-century account of Madame d'Aulnoy, on the rare occasions that it was, would come \"from afar, preserved in pig's tripes and full of worms\". Butter was only produced locally in places such as Galicia, Asturias and Soria, or was imported, preserved in potassium nitrate, (the so-called \"Flanders' butter\").\nBy the 18th century, many American ingredients, such as peppers and tomatoes, had been fully incorporated into Spanish cuisine. Contemporary foreign visitors, such as French ambassador Jean-François de Bourgoing, judged negatively this change happening in Spain by the late part of the century: \"Spanish cooking, which they have inherited, is not generally pleasing to foreigners. Spaniards like strong condiments such as pepper, tomato sauce, hot peppers and saffron, which color or infect nearly all their dishes.\"\nSpain was the bridge for the Columbian exchange between the rest of Europe and the New World. Many traditional Spanish dishes such as tortilla de patata (an omelette made with potatoes), would not be possible without the Columbian exchange. Gazpacho, salmorejo, and pan con tomate are made with tomatoes, which traveled from the New World to the Old World.\nFor most of the 19th century, the aristocracy consumed a set of dishes that was largely an imitation of French cuisine. That was the available cuisine at the time, together with the degeneration of regional cuisines. One positive foreign take on the Spanish dishes—opposing the largely negative views of other foreign commentators—was that of Richard Ford, who was fond of Spanish specialties such as sherry and ham.\n\nModern Spanish cuisine was gestated in the late-19th to early-20th century, with gastronomes and writers such as Mariano Pardo de Figueroa (Dr. Thebussem), José Castro y Serrano, Ángel Muro, Emilia Pardo Bazán, and Dionisio Pérez, some of whom put effort into developing the idea of a \"national cuisine\" recognisable by Spaniards as their own.\nKeen on participating in the Spanish nation-building process, Dr. Thebussem, in an autochthonous example of culinary nationalism, proposed to the King's Chef that the olla podrida (a rustic stew typically made of meat, legumes and other vegetables) should be served at official banquets as a national dish. This could be considered an important step in the process of straying away from the French cooking paradigm, which was dominant in the 19th century in Europe. Olla podrida had been previously ridiculed in foreign (most notably French) satires.\nAlthough the new foodscape built in opposition to the French centralist culinary model accounted for the awareness of the distinctive regional singularities, subsequent food writers in the country would continue to cope with the tension between the Spanish peripheral and centralist foodscapes.\nThe influential cooking book 1080 recetas de cocina by Simone Ortega (first published in 1972) became a hit in Spain, remaining as of 2019 the third best-selling book ever in the history of the country after Don Quixote and the Bible. This was not a book exclusively of Spanish traditional recipes, but also included French recipes, bringing an exotic penchant to Spanish homes.\nTelevised cooking shows started in the country in 1984 with Con las manos en la masa.\n\n## Meal routines\nA continental-style breakfast (desayuno) may be eaten just after waking up, or before entering the workplace. Common breakfast items include coffee, milk, chocolate drink, biscuits (most notably Marie biscuits), magdalenas, toast (featuring ingredients such as oil, tomato and butter), and churros.\nDue to the large time span between breakfast and lunch, it is not uncommon to halt the working schedule to take a mid-morning snack.\nLunch (el almuerzo or la comida, literally meaning \"the meal\"), the large midday meal in Spain, contains several courses, especially in restaurants. In some regions of Spain, the word almuerzo refers to the mid-morning snack, instead of lunch. Lunch usually starts around 2:00–2:30 p.m. and finishes around 3:00–3:30 p.m., and is usually followed by sobremesa, which refers to the table talk that Spanish people undertake. Menus are organized according to these courses and include five or six choices in each course. At home, Spanish meals contain one or two courses and a dessert. The content of this meal is usually a soup dish, salad, a meat or a fish dish, and a dessert such as fruit, yoghurt or something sweet. Tapas may also be typically served before or during lunch.\nAccording to a 2017 report, the Spanish government has taken steps to shorten the traditional long lunch break in an effort to end the workday earlier. Most businesses shut down for two or three hours for lunch, then resume the working day until dinner time in the evening.\nLa cena, meaning both dinner or supper, is taken between 8:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. It typically consists of one course and dessert. Due to the large time span between lunch and dinner, an afternoon snack, la merienda, equivalent to afternoon tea, may take place at about 6:00 p.m. At merienda, people typically drink coffee, eat something sweet, or eat a sandwich or a piece of fruit.\nSome country-wide staple dishes common throughout Spain include croquetas (croquettes), paella (a rice dish from the Valencian community), ensaladilla rusa (Olivier salad), gazpacho (a cold vegetable soup), and tortilla de patatas (Spanish omelette). There is a disagreement in Spanish society regarding onion as an ingredient in the Spanish omelette, often accompanied by highly opinionated views on either side.\n\nTapas (appetizers), served before lunch or dinner, or during them, are common. It is also common for tapas to be provided as a complimentary appetizer in bars and cafes when ordering a drink. Other common tapas include mejillones en escabeche (marinated mussels), gildas, albóndigas (meatballs), callos, torreznos, or raxo de cerdo.\n\n## Regional cuisines\n\n\n### Andalusia\nAndalusian cuisine is twofold: rural and coastal. Of all the Spanish regions, this region uses the most olive oil in its cuisine. The Andalusian dish that has possibly achieved the most international fame is gazpacho, a cold soup made with chopped vegetables, such as tomatoes and green peppers, vinegar, water, salt, olive oil, and bread (crumbs). Other cold soups include poleá, zoque and salmorejo.\nEating olives as a snack is common. Meat dishes include flamenquín, pringá, oxtail stew, and menudo gitano (also called Andalusian tripe). Hot soups include sopa de gato (made with bread), caldillo de perro (fish soup with orange juice) and migas canas. Fish dishes include pescaíto frito, soldaditos de Pavía, and parpandúa.\nCured meats include serrano ham and ibérico ham. Typical drinks in the area include anise, wine (such as Malaga, Jerez, and Pedro Ximénez), and sherry brandy.\n\n### Aragon\nAragonese cuisine has a rural origin. One of its most famous dishes is asado de ternasco (roast lamb), in which lamb is cooked with garlic, salt, olive oil, laurel leaves, thyme, and parsley. Pork dishes are also very popular, among them, magras con tomate. Popular Aragonese recipes made with bread are migas de Pastor, migas con chocolate, regañaos, and goguera.\nLegumes are very important to Aragonese dishes, but the most popular vegetables are borage and thistle, as well as the famed tomate rosa de Barbastro. Jamón de Teruel and ham from Huesca are frequently used cured meats. Among the cheeses, queso de Tronchón is notable. Fruit-based cuisine includes frutas de Aragón (English: 'fruits of Aragon', candied fruits covered in chocolate) and maraschino cherries. Melocotón con vino consists of melocotón de Calanda, a regional peach variant, infused in red wine with sugar and cinnamon.\nOther sweet Aragonese specialities are trenza de Almudevar, tortas de alma, guirlache (a type of nougat), adoquín del Pilar, and Españoletas (a kind of local cookie).\nThe prevalence of peaches in Aragonese cuisine extends to drinks. Sopeta is a traditional beverage emerging from sliced peach, white wine and sugar. The best-known wines of Aragon are those from Cariñena, Somontano (Huesca), Calatayud, and Campo de Borja.\n\n### Asturias\nAsturian cuisine has a long and rich history, deeply rooted in Celtic traditions of Atlantic Europe. One of its most famous dishes is fabada asturiana. Fabada is the traditional stew of the region, made with white beans, sausages (such as chorizo and morcilla), and pork. A well-known recipe is fabes con almejas (beans with clams). Asturian beans (fabes) can also be cooked with hare, partridge, prawns, or octopus. Another known recipe is pote asturiano (made with white beans, kale, potatoes, and a variety of sausages and bacon) and potaje de vigilia.\nPork-based foods such as chosco, callos a l'asturiana, and bollu preñáu (chorizo-stuffed bread rolls) are popular. Common meat dishes include carne gobernada (roasted veal), cachopo (a crunchy, crumb-coated veal steak stuffed with ham and cheese), and caldereta. Fish and seafood play an important role in Asturian cuisine. The Cantabrian Sea provides a rich variety of species, including tuna, hake and sardines.\nAsturian cheeses are very popular in the rest of Spain. Among them, the most representative is Cabrales cheese, a pungent, blue cheese developed in the regions near the Picos de Europa. Other popular cheese types are gamonéu afuega'l pitu, and queso de Pría. These are usually enjoyed with the local cider, a low-alcohol drink made of Asturian apples with a distinctive sourness.\nAsturian cider, Sidra de Asturias, made of a special type of apple, is traditionally poured escanciada from a certain height, usually over the head of the waiter/server. When the cider falls into the glass from above, the drink \"breaks\", becoming aerated and bubbly. It is consumed immediately after being served, in consecutive, tiny shots.\nNotable desserts are frisuelos (similar to crêpes, usually filled with cream or apple jam), rice pudding (white rice cooked with milk, lemon zest and sugar), and carbayón (dulce) (puff pastry cakes filled with almond mash and covered with sugar glaze).\n\n### Balearic Islands\nBalearic cuisine has purely Mediterranean characteristics due to its location. The islands have been conquered several times throughout their history by the French and the English, which left some culinary influences. Some well-known food items are the sobrassada, arroz brut, mahón cheese, gin de Menorca (pelota), and mayonnaise. Among the dishes are tumbet, frito mallorquín, and roasted suckling pig. Popular desserts include ensaïmada, tambor d'ametlla, and suspiros de Manacor.\n\n### Basque Country\nThe cuisine of the Basque Country has a wide and varied range of ingredients and preparations. Food and drinks are especially important in the Basque culture. Highlights include meat and fish dishes. Among fish, cod (bacalao) is produced in various preparations, such as bacalao al pil pil and bacalao a la vizcaína. Also popular are anchovies, bream, and bonito. Among the most famous dishes is changurro (stuffed king crab). Common meat dishes include beef steaks, pork loin with milk, fig leaf quail, and marinated goose.\nTxakoli or chacolí (a white wine characterised by its high acidity and a lesser-than-average alcohol content) is a staple drink from the Basque Country, produced in Álava, Guipúzcoa and Biscay. Basque cider is popular following the apple harvest and is served in cider houses and bars.\n\n### Canary Islands\nThe Canary Islands have a unique cuisine due to their geographical location in the Atlantic Ocean. The Canary Islands were part of the trading routes to the Americas, hence creating a melting pot of different culinary traditions. Fish (fresh or salted) and potatoes are among the most common staple foods in the islands. The consumption of cheese, fruits, and pork also characterizes Canarian cuisine. The islands' close proximity to continental Africa influences the climate and creates a range of warm temperatures that in modern times have fostered the agriculture of tropical and semitropical crops: bananas, yams, mangoes, avocados, and persimmons. These crops are heavily used in Canarian cuisine.\nThe aboriginal people, Guanches, based their diet on gofio (a type of flour made of different toasted grains), shellfish, and goat and pork products. Gofio is still consumed in the islands and has become part of the traditional cuisine.\nA sauce called mojo is very common throughout the islands. It has been adapted and developed in many ways, so that it may complement various main dishes. Fish dishes usually require a \"green mojo\" made from coriander or parsley, while roasted meats require a red variety made from chilli peppers that are commonly known as mojo picón.\nSome classic dishes in the Canary Islands include papas arrugadas, almogrote, frangollo, rabbit in salmorejo sauce, and stewed goat.\nSome popular desserts are truchas (pastries filled with sweet potato or pumpkin), roasted gofio (a gofio-based dough with nuts and honey), príncipe Alberto (a mousse-like preparation with almonds, coffee, and chocolate), and quesillo (a variety of flan made with condensed milk).\nWineries are common in the islands. However, only Malvasia wine from Lanzarote has gained international recognition.\n\n### Cantabria\nA popular Cantabrian dish is cocido montañés (highlander stew): a rich stew made with beans, cabbage, and pork. Seafood is widely used and bonito is present in the typical sorropotún or marmita de bonitu (tuna pot). Recognized quality meats include Tudanca veal and game meat.\nCantabrian pastries include sobaos and quesadas pasiegas. Dairy products include Cantabrian cream cheese, smoked cheeses, picón Bejes-Tresviso, and quesucos de Liébana.\nAs for alcohol, orujo is the Cantabrian pomace brandy. Cider (sidra) and chacoli wine are also favorites. Cantabria has two wines labelled denominación de origen calificada ('denomination of qualified origin'): Costa de Cantabria and Liébana.\n\n### Castile-La Mancha\nIn Castilla-La Mancha, the culinary habits reflect the origin of foods eaten by shepherds and peasants. Wheat and grains are a dominant product and ingredient—they are used in bread, soups, gazpacho manchego, migas, and porridge. One of the most abundant ingredients in Manchego cuisine is garlic, leading to dishes such as ajoarriero, ajo puerco, and ajo mataero.\nSome traditional recipes are gazpacho manchego, pisto manchego, and migas ruleras. Also popular in this region is morteruelo, a kind of foie gras. Manchego cheese is also renowned.\nBecause its lands are dry, and thus unable to sustain large amounts of cattle living on grass, an abundance of small animals, such as rabbit and especially birds (pheasant, quail, partridge, squab), can be found. This has led to game meat being incorporated into traditional dishes, such as conejo al Ajillo (rabbit in garlic sauce), perdiz escabechada (marinated partridge) or huevos de codorniz (quail eggs).\n\n### Castile and León\nIn Castile and León, characteristic dishes include morcilla (a black pudding made with special spices), judión de la Granja, sopa de ajo (garlic soup), cochinillo asado (roast piglet), lechazo (roast lamb), and chuletón de Ávila (Ávila rib steak). Other foods include botillo del Bierzo, hornazo from Salamanca, jamón de Guijuelo (a cured ham from Guijuelo, Salamanca), salchicha de Zaratán, other sausages, Serrada cheese (made from sheep's milk), queso de Burgos, and Ribera del Duero wines.\nMajor wines in Castilian–Leonese cuisine include the robust wine of Toro, reds from Ribera del Duero, whites from Rueda, and clarets from Cigales.\n\n### Catalonia\nThe extensive cuisine of Catalonia has rural origins and features foods from three climates: coastal, mountains, and the interiors. Some famous dishes include escudella, pa amb tomàquet, coca de recapte, samfaina, thyme soup, caragols a la llauna, and the bomba de Barceloneta. Notable sauces are romesco sauce, aioli, bouillabaisse of Catalan origin, and picada.\nCured pork cuisine includes botifarra (white and black) and the fuet of Vic. Fish dishes include suquet (fish stew), cod stew, and arròs negre. Among the vegetable dishes, the most famous are calçots and escalivada (roasted vegetables). Desserts include Catalan cream, carquinyolis, panellets, tortell, and neules.\n\n### Extremadura\nThe cuisine of Extremadura is simple at heart, with dishes based on those prepared by shepherds. It is very similar to the cuisine of Castilla. Extremaduran cuisine is abundant in pork; it is said that the region is one of the best for breeding pigs in Spain thanks to the acorns that grow in their fields. Iberian pig herds raised in the fields of Montánchez are characterized by dark skin and thin legs. This breed of pig is found exclusively in Southwestern Iberia, both in Spain and Portugal. Iberian pork products such as sausages are common and often added to stews (cocido extremeño), as well as cachuela (pork liver pâté seasoned with paprika, garlic and other spices).\nOther meat dishes include lamb stew or goat stew (caldereta de cordero and caldereta de cabrito). Additionally, meat dishes can include game meats, such as wild boar, partridge, pheasant, or venison.\n\nDistinctive cheeses from the region include the so-called quesos de torta (sheep milk cheeses typically curdled with the infusion of thistle). Both the torta of La Serena and the torta of El Casar enjoy a protected designation of origin. Among the desserts are leche frita, perrunilla, and pestiños (fritters), as well as many sweets that have their origins in convents.\nCod preparations are well-known, and tench is among the most traditional freshwater fish, with fish and vegetable dishes such as moje de peces or escarapuche.\nSoups are often bread-based and are served in both hot and cold forms. Pennyroyal mint is sometimes used to season gazpachos or soups such as sopa de poleo. Extremaduran ajoblanco (ajoblanco extremeño) is a cold soup, which is different from Andalusian ajoblanco since it contains egg yolk in the emulsion and vegetables but no almonds.\nThe northeastern comarca of La Vera produces pimentón de la Vera, a smoked paprika highly valued all over Spain and extensively used in Extremaduran cuisine.\nThe region is also known for its vino de pitarra tradition (homemade wine made in small earthenware vessels).\n\n### Galicia\nGalician cuisine is well known throughout Spain because of emigration to other regions. Similar to neighbouring Asturias, Galicia shares some culinary traditions in stews and soups with the Celtic nations of Atlantic Europe. One of the most noted Galician dishes is soup. Also notable in this region is pork with turnip tops, a popular component of the Galician carnival meal laconadas. Another recipe is caldo de castañas (a chestnut broth), which is commonly consumed during winter. Pork products are also popular. Cattle raising is very common in Galicia, consequently red meat is consumed often, typically with potatoes.\nThe simplicity and authenticity of Galician cooking methods were praised in the early 20th century by the prominent gastronome Manuel Puga e Parga (also known as Picadillo), who praised dishes such as lacón con grelos or caldeiradas (fish stew), in opposition to the perceived sophistication of the French cuisine.\nGalician seafood dishes are well-known and rich in variety. Among these are empanadas, octopus, scallops, crab, and barnacles. In the city of Santiago de Compostela, located along an ancient pilgrim trail from the Pyrenees, it was customary for travelers to eat scallops upon first arriving in the city.\nAmong the many dairy products is queso de tetilla.\nThe queimadas (a folkloric preparation of orujo) consists of mixing alcoholic beverages with peels of orange or lemon, sugar or coffee beans, prepared in a nearly ritual ceremony involving the flambé of the beverage. Sweets that are famous throughout the Iberian Peninsula are the tarta de Santiago and filloas (crêpes).\n\n### La Rioja\nLa Rioja is recognized for its use of meats such as pork and cold cuts, which are produced after the traditional slaughter. Lamb is perhaps the second most popular meat product in this region (chuletillas al sarmiento). Veal is common in mountainous areas. The most famous dishes are Rioja style potatoes and fritada. Another well-known dish is caparrones (Rioja stew). Lesser-known dishes are almuerzo del Santo and ajo huevo (garlic eggs). Pimientos asados (roasted peppers) is a notable vegetable dish.\nLa Rioja is famously known in Spain for its red wine, so most of these dishes are served with wine. Rioja wine has designated origin status.\n\n### Madrid\nMadrid did not have a special regional identity before 1561, when king Philip II made it the capital of Spain. Since then, due to immigration, many of Madrid's culinary dishes have been made from modifications to dishes from other Spanish regions. Madrid, due to the influx of visitors from the nineteenth century onwards, was one of the first cities to introduce the concept of the restaurant, hosting some of the earliest examples.\n\n### Murcia\nThe cuisine of the region of Murcia can be said to have two versions, one linked to the huerta (irrigated areas) and another one closer to Manchego cuisine. The region of Murcia is famous for its varied fruit production. Among the most outstanding dishes are tortilla murciana, zarangollo, mojete, aubergine a la crème, and pipirrana. A typical sauce of this area is ajo cabañil, used to accompany meat dishes.\nRegional dishes include michirones (beans cooked with bay leaves, hot peppers and garlic), olla gitana, cocido murciano con pelotas, and sopa de mondongo.\nSome meat products from Murcia are morcilla (black pudding), which is flavored with oregano, and pastel murciano, made with ground beef. Among fish and seafood preparations are the dorada a la sal, prawns from the Mar Menor, and baked octopus. Rice dishes are common and include caldero, arroz empedrado, paella Valenciana (rice with rabbit and snails), arroz de escribano, and arroz viudo.\nConfectionery products include exploradores and pastel de Cierva, typical in Murcia gastronomy and found in almost every pastry shop in Murcia. They are both sweet and savoury at the same time. Paparajotes is another dessert, made from lemon leaves.\nThis region also has wine appellations of origin, such as the wines from Jumilla, Bullas and Yecla.\n\n### Navarra\nThe gastronomy of Navarra has many similarities with Basque cuisine. Some of its best-known dishes are trucha a la navarra (Navarra-style trout), ajoarriero, cordero en chilindrón, and relleno. There are also recipes such as Carlists eggs (omelet).\nSalted products are common and include chorizo de Pamplona, bacalao al ajoarriero, stuffing and sausage. The lamb and beef have, at present, designations of origin. Some dairy products are Roncal cheese, curd, and Idiazabal cheese. Typical alcoholic drinks include claret and pacharán.\n\n### Valencia\nThe cuisine of Valencia has two aspects: rural and coastal. A popular and famous Valencia creation is paella, a rice dish cooked in a circular pan and topped with vegetables and meats (originally rabbit and chicken). Dishes such as arroz con costra, arròs negre, fideuá, arròz al horn (arròs al forn in the Valencian language), and rice with beans and turnips are also common in the city.\nCoastal towns supply the region with fish, leading to popular dishes like all i pebre (fish stew), typical of the Albufera.\nThe desserts in this region include coffee liqueur, chocolate Alicante, arnadí, and horchata, the last two being of Muslim origin. Notably, during Christmas, nougat is made in Alicante and Jijona. Another well-known dessert is peladillas (almonds wrapped in a thick layer of caramel).\n\n## Notable Spanish chefs\nFerran Adrià\nJuan Mari Arzak\nSanti Santamaría\nMartín Berasategui\nCarme Ruscalleda\nJosé Andrés – (restaurants: Minibar by José Andrés, Washington D.C.) – Andrés hosts Made in Spain on PBS.\nKarlos Arguiñano – celebrity television chef\nSergi Arola – (restaurants: La Broché, Arola, and Sergi Arola Gastro)\nPenelope Casas – New York-born cookbook author\nCarlos Dominguez Cidon – recipient of the \"Premio Alimentos\" award in 1999 and Michelin Guiding Star award in 2004; author of eight books\nMaría Mestayer de Echagüe – also known as \"Marquesa de Parabere\", the author of a two-volume cooking encyclopaedia entitled La Cocina Completa\nÁngel Muro – a 19th-century food expert and author of the book Practicón\nSimone and Ines Ortega – authors of 1080 recetas (1080 Recipes)\nManuel María Puga y Parga – an early-20th century food expert and author of La cocina práctica\nIlan Hall – (restaurants: Casa Mono, Manhattan, NY) – winner of Top Chef Season 2\nJoan Roca, Jordi Roca i Fontané, and Josep Roca i Fontané – (restaurants: \"El Celler de Can Roca\", \"Rocambolesc\", \"Can Roca\", \"Mas Marroch\", and \"Cap Roig\" in the province of Girona; \"Roca Barcelona\" in the province of Barcelona) – Three Michelin stars in 2009.

This is reflected culturally through its cuisine. Historically, the spice trade developed throughout the Indian subcontinent as well as in East Asia and the Middle East. Europe's demand for spices was among the economic and cultural factors that encouraged exploration in the early modern period.\n\n## Definition\nAlthough defining spice is difficult, varying definitions cover several common aspects. One such aspect is the biological source of spices: the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) identifies the source as vegetables, while Redgrove (1933) is more specific as to the part of the plant, specifically the root, rhizome, flower, fruit, seed and bark when they are dried, in contrast with herbaceous parts which constitute herbs. The Oxford Companion to Food challenges spices as sourced from plants being a hard rule, pointing to ambergris being often identified as a spice despite its animal origin.\nAnother aspect is the geographical source: The OED specifies spices are sourced from the tropics, while The Oxford Companion to Food gives the example of caraway seeds as demonstrating that spices can come from temperate climes. The notion that spices have a tropical origin is historic: originally \"spice\" was understood as a type of merchandise from the Orient. As Europeans encountered the Americas, beginning the Columbian exchange, the meaning expanded to capture new aromatics, and the meaning later shifted again to refer to culinary use. This historic development has led to some ingredients indigenous to European cooking such as garlic and horseradish not being considered spices despite sharing many attributes.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Early history\nArcheological study of early spice use is difficult, as spices were used in small quantities, leaving few preserved remains.\nThe spice trade developed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Middle East by 2000 BCE with cinnamon and black pepper, and in East Asia with herbs and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for cuisine and mummification. Their demand for exotic spices and herbs helped stimulate world trade.\nCloves were used in Mesopotamia by 1700 BCE. The earliest written records of spices come from ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian cultures. The Ebers Papyrus from early Egypt dating from 1550 BCE describes some eight hundred different herbal medicinal remedies and numerous medicinal procedures.\nBy 1000 BCE, medical systems based on herbs could be found in China, Korea, and India. Early uses were associated with magic, medicine, religion, tradition, and preservation.\nIndonesian merchants traveled around China, India, the Middle East, and the east coast of Africa. Arab merchants facilitated the routes through the Middle East and India. This resulted in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria being the main trading center for spices. The most important discovery prior to the European spice trade was the monsoon winds (40 CE). Sailing from Eastern spice cultivators to Western European consumers gradually replaced the land-locked spice routes once facilitated by the Middle East Arab caravans.\nSpices were prominent enough in the ancient world that they are mentioned in the Old Testament. In Genesis, Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice merchants. In Exodus, manna is described as being similar to coriander in appearance. In the Song of Solomon, the male narrator compares his beloved to many saffron, cinnamon, and other spices.\nHistorians believe that nutmeg, which originates from the Banda Islands in Southeast Asia, was introduced to Europe in the 6th century BCE. The Romans had cloves in the 1st century CE, as Pliny the Elder wrote about them.\n\n### Middle Ages\nSpices were among the most demanded and expensive products available in Europe in the Middle Ages,[5] the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. Given medieval medicine's main theory of humorism, spices and herbs were indispensable to balance \"humors\" in food,[6] on a daily basis for good health at a time of recurrent pandemics. In addition to being desired by those using medieval medicine, the European elite also craved spices in the Middle Ages, believing spices to be from and a connection to \"paradise\". An example of the European aristocracy's demand for spice comes from the King of Aragon, who invested substantial resources into importing spices to Spain in the 12th century. He was specifically looking for spices to put in wine and was not alone among European monarchs at the time to have such a desire for spice.\nSpices were all imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them expensive. From the 8th until the 15th century, the Republic of Venice held a monopoly on spice trade with the Middle East, using this position to dominate the neighboring Italian maritime republics and city-states. The trade made the region rich. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000 tons of other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the Late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. The most exclusive was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen into obscurity in European cuisine include grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which mostly replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, along with long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal, and cubeb.\n\n### Early modern period\nVoyagers from Spain and Portugal were interested in seeking new routes to trade in spices and other valuable products from Asia. The control of trade routes and the spice-producing regions were the main reasons that Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama sailed to India in 1499.[8] When da Gama discovered the pepper market in India, he was able to secure peppers for a much lower cost than demanded by Venice. At around the same time, Christopher Columbus returned from the New World. He described to investors the new spices available there.\nAnother source of competition in the spice trade during the 15th and 16th centuries was the Ragusans from the maritime republic of Dubrovnik in southern Croatia. The military prowess of Afonso de Albuquerque (1453–1515) allowed the Portuguese to take control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he took the island of Socotra in the mouth of the Red Sea and, in 1507, Ormuz in the Persian Gulf. Since becoming the viceroy of the Indies, he took Goa in India in 1510, and Malacca on the Malay Peninsula in 1511. The Portuguese could now trade directly with Siam, China, and the Maluku Islands. \nWith the discovery of the New World came new spices, including allspice, chili peppers, vanilla, and chocolate. This development kept the spice trade, with the Americas as a latecomer with their new seasonings, profitable well into the 19th century.\n\n## Function\nSpices are primarily used as food flavoring or to create variety. They are also used to perfume cosmetics and incense. At various periods, many spices were used in herbal medicine. Finally, since they can be expensive, rare and exotic commodities, their conspicuous consumption has often been a symbol of wealth and social class.\n\n### Preservative claim\nIt is often claimed that spices were used either as food preservatives or to mask the taste of spoiled meat, especially in the European Middle Ages. This is false. In fact, spices are rather ineffective as preservatives as compared to salting, smoking, pickling, or drying, and are ineffective in covering the taste of spoiled meat. Moreover, spices have always been comparatively expensive: in 15th century Oxford, a whole pig cost about the same as a pound of the cheapest spice, pepper. There is also no evidence of such use from contemporary cookbooks: \"Old cookbooks make it clear that spices weren't used as a preservative. They typically suggest adding spices toward the end of the cooking process, where they could have no preservative effect whatsoever.\" Indeed, Cristoforo di Messisbugo suggested in the 16th century that pepper may speed up spoilage.\nThough some spices have antimicrobial properties in vitro, pepper—by far the most common spice—is relatively ineffective, and in any case, salt, which is far cheaper, is also far more effective.\n\n## Classification and types\n\n\n### Culinary herbs and spices\n\n\n### Botanical basis\n\n\n### Common spice mixtures\n\n\n## Handling\nA mortar and pestle is the classic set of tools for grinding a whole spice. Less labor-intensive tools are more common now: a microplane or fine grater can be used to grind small amounts; a coffee grinder is useful for larger amounts. A frequently used spice such as black pepper may merit storage in its own hand grinder or mill.\nThe flavor of a spice is derived in part from compounds (volatile oils) that oxidize or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a spice greatly increases its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation. Thus, the flavor is maximized by storing a spice whole and grinding when needed. The shelf life of a whole dry spice is roughly two years; of a ground spice roughly six months. The \"flavor life\" of a ground spice can be much shorter. Ground spices are better stored away from light.\nSome flavor elements in spices are soluble in water; many are soluble in oil or fat. As a general rule, the flavors from a spice take time to infuse into the food so spices are added early in preparation. This contrasts to herbs which are usually added late in preparation.\n\n### Salmonella contamination\nA study by the Food and Drug Administration of shipments of spices to the United States during fiscal years 2007–2009 showed about 7% of the shipments were contaminated by Salmonella bacteria, some of it antibiotic-resistant. As most spices are cooked before being served salmonella contamination often has no effect, but some spices, particularly pepper, are often eaten raw and are present at the table for convenient use. Shipments from Mexico and India, a major producer, were the most frequently contaminated. Food irradiation is said to minimize this risk.\n\n## Production\n\n\n## Standardization\nThe International Organization for Standardization addresses spices and condiments, along with related food additives, as part of the International Classification for Standards 67.220 series.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nTempering (spices)\nSpice rub\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nDavidson, Alan; Jaine, Tom (2014).

These spices found their way into the Near East before the beginning of the Christian era, with fantastic tales hiding their true sources.\nThe maritime aspect of the trade was dominated by the Austronesian peoples in Southeast Asia, namely the ancient Indonesian sailors who established routes from Southeast Asia to Sri Lanka and India (and later China) by 1500 BC. These goods were then transported by land toward the Mediterranean and the Greco-Roman world via the incense route and the Roman–India routes by Indian and Persian traders. The Austronesian maritime trade lanes later expanded into the Middle East and eastern Africa by the 1st millennium AD, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar.\nWithin specific regions, the Kingdom of Axum (5th century BC – 11th century AD) had pioneered the Red Sea route before the 1st century AD. During the first millennium AD, Ethiopians became the maritime trading power of the Red Sea. By this period, trade routes existed from Sri Lanka (the Roman Taprobane) and India, which had acquired maritime technology from early Austronesian contact. By the mid-7th century AD, after the rise of Islam, Arab traders started plying these maritime routes and dominated the western Indian Ocean maritime routes.\nArab traders eventually took over conveying goods via the Levant and Venetian merchants to Europe until the rise of the Seljuk Turks in 1090. Later the Ottoman Turks held the route again by 1453 respectively. Overland routes helped the spice trade initially, but maritime trade routes led to tremendous growth in commercial activities to Europe. \nThe trade was changed by the Crusades and later the European Age of Discovery, during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper, became an influential activity for European traders. From the 11th to the 15th centuries, the Italian maritime republics of Venice and Genoa monopolized the trade between Europe and Asia. The Cape Route from Europe to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope was pioneered by the Portuguese explorer navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, resulting in new maritime routes for trade.\nThis trade, which drove world trade from the end of the Middle Ages well into the Renaissance, ushered in an age of European domination in the East.  Channels such as the Bay of Bengal served as bridges for cultural and commercial exchanges between diverse cultures as nations struggled to gain control of the trade along the many spice routes. In 1571 the Spanish opened the first trans-Pacific route between its territories of the Philippines and Mexico, served by the Manila Galleon. This trade route lasted until 1815. The Portuguese trade routes were mainly restricted and limited by the use of ancient routes, ports, and nations that were difficult to dominate. The Dutch were later able to bypass many of these problems by pioneering a direct ocean route from the Cape of Good Hope to the Sunda Strait in Indonesia.",

Later the Ottoman Turks held the route again by 1453 respectively. Overland routes helped the spice trade initially, but maritime trade routes led to tremendous growth in commercial activities to Europe. \nThe trade was changed by the Crusades and later the European Age of Discovery, during which the spice trade, particularly in black pepper, became an influential activity for European traders. From the 11th to the 15th centuries, the Italian maritime republics of Venice and Genoa monopolized the trade between Europe and Asia. The Cape Route from Europe to the Indian Ocean via the Cape of Good Hope was pioneered by the Portuguese explorer navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, resulting in new maritime routes for trade.\nThis trade, which drove world trade from the end of the Middle Ages well into the Renaissance, ushered in an age of European domination in the East.  Channels such as the Bay of Bengal served as bridges for cultural and commercial exchanges between diverse cultures as nations struggled to gain control of the trade along the many spice routes. In 1571 the Spanish opened the first trans-Pacific route between its territories of the Philippines and Mexico, served by the Manila Galleon. This trade route lasted until 1815. The Portuguese trade routes were mainly restricted and limited by the use of ancient routes, ports, and nations that were difficult to dominate. The Dutch were later able to bypass many of these problems by pioneering a direct ocean route from the Cape of Good Hope to the Sunda Strait in Indonesia.\n\n## Origins\nPeople in the Indian Ocean and Island Southeast Asia traded in spices, obsidian, seashells, gemstones and other high-value materials as early as the 10th millennium BC. The first to mention the trade in historical periods are the ancient Egyptians. In the 3rd millennium BC, they traded with the Land of Punt, which is believed to have been situated in an area encompassing northern Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and the Red Sea coast of Sudan.\n\nThe spice trade was initially associated with overland routes, but maritime routes proved to be the factor that helped the trade grow. The first true maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was by the Austronesian peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia. They established trade routes with South India and Sri Lanka from around 1500 BC to 600 BC, ushering an exchange of material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, lashed-lug boats, sewn boats, and sampans) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas, and sugarcane), as well as spices endemic to the Maluku Islands (cloves and nutmeg). It also connected the material cultures of India and China later on via the Maritime Silk Road. Ethnic groups in Indonesia in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamaran and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by the first half of the first millennium AD. It continued into historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road.\nIn the first millennium BC, Arabs, Phoenicians, and Indians were also engaged in sea and land trade in luxury goods such as spices, gold, precious stones, leather of exotic animals, ebony and pearls. Maritime trade was in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The sea route in the Red Sea was from Bab-el-Mandeb to Berenice Troglodytica in Upper Egypt, from there inland to the Nile, and then by boat to Alexandria. Luxury goods like Indian spices, ebony, silk and fine textiles were traded along the overland Incense Route.\nIn the second half of the first millennium BC the tribes of South and West Arabia took control over the land trade of spices from South Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea. These established Ma'in, Qataban, Hadhramaut, Sheba, and Himyar. In the north, the Nabateans took control of the trade route that crossed the Negev from Petra to Gaza. The trade enriched these tribes. South Arabia was called Eudaemon Arabia (the elated Arabia) by the ancient Greeks and was on the agenda of Alexander the Great before he died. Indians and the Arabs controlled the sea trade with India. In the late second century BC, the Greeks from the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt learned from the Indians how to sail directly from Aden to the west coast of India using the monsoon winds (as did Hippalus) and took control of the sea trade via Red Sea ports.\nSpices are discussed in biblical narratives, and there is literary evidence for their use in ancient Greek and Roman society. There is a record from Tamil texts of Greeks purchasing large sacks of black pepper from India, and many recipes in the 1st-century Roman cookbook Apicius make use of the spice. The trade in spices lessened after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, but demand for ginger, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg revived the trade in later centuries.\n\n## Arab trade and medieval Europe\nRome played a part in the spice trade during the 5th century, but this role did not last through the Middle Ages. The rise of Islam brought a significant change to the trade as Radhanite Jewish and Arab merchants, particularly from Egypt, eventually took over conveying goods via the Levant to Europe. At times, Jews enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the spice trade in large parts of Western Europe.\nThe spice trade had brought great riches to the Abbasid Caliphate and inspired famous legends such as that of Sinbad the Sailor. These early sailors and merchants would often set sail from the port city of Basra and, after many ports of call, would return to sell their goods, including spices, in Baghdad. The fame of many spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon are attributed to these early spice merchants.\nThe Indian commercial connection with South East Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and Persia during the 7th and 8th centuries. Arab traders — mainly descendants of sailors from Yemen and Oman — dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and linking to the secret \"spice islands\" (Maluku Islands and Banda Islands). The islands of Molucca also find mention in several records: a Javanese chronicle (1365) mentions the Moluccas and Maloko, and navigational works of the 14th and 15th centuries contain the first unequivocal Arab reference to Moluccas. Sulaima al-Mahr writes: \"East of Timor [where sandalwood is found] are the islands of Bandam and they are the islands where nutmeg and mace are found. The islands of cloves are called Maluku .....\"\nMoluccan products were shipped to trading emporiums in India, passing through ports like Kozhikode in Kerala and through Sri Lanka. From there they were shipped westward across the ports of Arabia to the Near East, to Ormus in the Persian Gulf and Jeddah in the Red Sea and sometimes to East Africa, where they were used for many purposes, including burial rites. The Abbasids used Alexandria, Damietta, Aden and Siraf as entry ports to trade with India and China. Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk, camphor, ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad, the sultan of Yemen.\nIndian spice exports find mention in the works of Ibn Khurdadhbeh (850), al-Ghafiqi (1150), Ishak bin Imaran (907) and Al Kalkashandi (14th century). Chinese traveler Xuanzang mentions the town of Puri where \"merchants depart for distant countries.\"\n\nFrom there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. From the 8th until the 15th century, maritime republics (Republic of Venice, Republic of Pisa, Republic of Genoa, Duchy of Amalfi, Duchy of Gaeta, Republic of Ancona and Republic of Ragusa) held a monopoly on European trade with the Middle East. The silk and spice trade, involving spices, incense, herbs, drugs and opium, made these Mediterranean city-states extremely wealthy. Spices were among the most expensive and in-demand products of the Middle Ages, used in medicine as well as in the kitchen. They were all imported from Asia and Africa. Venetian and other navigators of maritime republics then distributed the goods through Europe.\n\n## Age of Discovery: a new route and a New World\nThe Republic of Venice had become a formidable power and a key player in the Eastern spice trade.  Other powers, in an attempt to break the Venetian hold on spice trade, began to build up maritime capability. Until the mid-15th century, trade with the East was achieved through the Silk Road, with the Byzantine Empire and the Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa acting as middlemen.\nThe first country to attempt to circumnavigate Africa was Portugal, which had, since the early 15th century, begun to explore northern Africa under Henry the Navigator. Emboldened by these early successes and eyeing a lucrative monopoly on a possible sea route to the Indies, the Portuguese first rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 on an expedition led by Bartolomeu Dias. Just nine years later in 1497, on the orders of Manuel I of Portugal, four vessels under the command of navigator Vasco da Gama continued beyond to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi and sailed across the Indian Ocean to Calicut, on the Malabar Coast in Kerala in South India — the capital of the local Zamorin rulers. The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore; the Portuguese Empire was the earliest European seaborne empire to grow from the spice trade.\n\nIn 1511, Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca for Portugal, then the center of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic and exploratory missions, including to the Moluccas. Learning the secret location of the Spice Islands, mainly the Banda Islands, then the world source of nutmeg, he sent an expedition led by António de Abreu to Banda, where they were the first Europeans to arrive, in early 1512. Abreu's expedition reached Buru, Ambon and Seram Islands, and then Banda.\n\nFrom 1507 to 1515 Albuquerque tried to completely block Arab and other traditional routes that stretched from the shores of Western India to the Mediterranean Sea, through the conquest of strategic bases in the Persian Gulf and at the entry of the Red Sea. \nBy the early 16th century the Portuguese had complete control of the African sea route, which extended through a long network of routes that linked three oceans, from the Moluccas (the Spice Islands) in the Pacific Ocean limits, through Malacca, Kerala and Sri Lanka, to Lisbon in Portugal. \nThe Crown of Castile had organized the expedition of Christopher Columbus to compete with Portugal for the spice trade with Asia, but when Columbus landed on the island of Hispaniola (in what is now Haiti) instead of in the Indies, the search for a route to Asia was postponed until a few years later. After Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama in 1513, the Spanish Crown prepared a westward voyage by Ferdinand Magellan in order to reach Asia from Spain across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. On October 21, 1520, his expedition crossed the Strait of Magellan in the southern tip of South America, opening the Pacific to European exploration. On March 16, 1521, the ships reached the Philippines and soon after the Spice Islands, ultimately resulting decades later in the Manila Galleon trade, the first westward spice trade route to Asia. After Magellan's death in the Philippines, navigator Juan Sebastian Elcano took command of the expedition and drove it across the Indian Ocean and back to Spain, where they arrived in 1522 aboard the last remaining ship, the Victoria. For the next two-and-a-half centuries, Spain controlled a vast trade network that linked three continents: Asia, the Americas and Europe. A global spice route had been created: from Manila in the Philippines (Asia) to Seville in Spain (Europe), via Acapulco in Mexico (North America).\n\n## Cultural diffusion\nOne of the most important technological exchanges of the spice trade network was the early introduction of maritime technologies to India, the Middle East, East Africa, and China by the Austronesian peoples. These technologies include the plank-sewn hulls, catamarans, outrigger boats, and possibly the lateen sail. This is still evident in Sri Lankan and South Indian languages. For example, Tamil paṭavu, Telugu paḍava, and Kannada paḍahu, all meaning \"ship\", are all derived from Proto-Hesperonesian *padaw, \"sailboat\", with Austronesian cognates like Javanese perahu, Kadazan padau, Maranao padaw, Cebuano paráw, Samoan folau, Hawaiian halau, and Māori wharau.\nAustronesians also introduced many Austronesian cultigens to southern India, Sri Lanka, and eastern Africa that figured prominently in the spice trade. They include bananas, Pacific domesticated coconuts, Dioscorea yams, wetland rice, sandalwood, giant taro, Polynesian arrowroot, ginger, lengkuas, tailed pepper, betel, areca nut, and sugarcane.\nHindu and Buddhist religious establishments of Southeast Asia came to be associated with economic activity and commerce as patrons, entrusted large funds which would later be used to benefit local economies by estate management, craftsmanship, and promotion of trading activities. Buddhism, in particular, traveled alongside the maritime trade, promoting coinage, art, and literacy. Islam spread throughout the East, reaching maritime Southeast Asia in the 10th century; Muslim merchants played a crucial part in the trade. Christian missionaries, such as Saint Francis Xavier, were instrumental in the spread of Christianity in the East. Christianity competed with Islam to become the dominant religion of the Moluccas. However, the natives of the Spice Islands accommodated to aspects of both religions easily.\nThe Portuguese colonial settlements saw traders, such as the Gujarati banias, South Indian Chettis, Syrian Christians, Chinese from Fujian province, and Arabs from Aden, involved in the spice trade. Epics, languages, and cultural customs were borrowed by Southeast Asia from India, and later China. Knowledge of Portuguese language became essential for merchants involved in the trade. The colonial pepper trade drastically changed the experience of modernity in Europe, and in Kerala and it brought, along with colonialism, early capitalism to India's Malabar Coast, changing cultures of work and caste.\nIndian merchants involved in spice trade took Indian cuisine to Southeast Asia, notably present day Malaysia and Indonesia, where spice mixtures and black pepper became popular. Conversely, Southeast Asian cuisine and crops was also introduced to India and Sri Lanka, where rice cakes and coconut milk-based dishes are still dominant.\nEuropean people intermarried with Indians and popularized valuable culinary skills, such as baking, in India. Indian food, adapted to the European palate, became visible in England by 1811 as exclusive establishments began catering to the tastes of both the curious and those returning from India. Opium was a part of the spice trade, and some people involved in the spice trade were driven by opium addiction.\n\n## See also\nEast Indies\nSilk Road\n Food portal\n\n## References\n\n\n## Bibliography\nKalidasan, Vinod Kottayil (2015). \"Routes of Pepper: Colonial Discourses around Spice Trade in Malabar\" in Kerala Modernity: Ideas, Spaces and Practices in Transition, Shiju Sam Varughese and Sathese Chandra Bose (Eds).

Tea is also an important beverage throughout the country, and Sri Lanka is known for producing some of the world's finest tea.\n\n## Regions\nIn areas located on the island's coasts, seafood is a standard feature of the local dishes. Tamil cuisine, especially in Jaffna, shares many similarities with South Indian cuisine. Kandyan Sinhalese cooking is based on local ingredients, including hill vegetables and fruits.\n\n## Common ingredients\nHerbs: pandan leaf (rampe), curry leaf (karapincha), shallot, goraka, lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, ginger, lime, cayenne pepper, tabasco pepper\nFish: Maldives fish, dried fish, mackerel, tuna, shark, sprats, fermented preserved fish\nFruits: bananas, mangoes, pineapple, soursop, guava, avocado, orange\nGrains: white rice (some common varieties are Samba, Kekulu, and Suwandel), red rice (some common varieties are Kekulu, Pachchaperumal, Kaluheenati, and Madathawalu), finger millet, hog millet, olu haal (water lily seed)\nMeats: chicken, beef, pork, mutton\nOils:  coconut oil, sesame oil, cow ghee, buffalo ghee, mustard oil\nSpices: cinnamon, black pepper, fennel, cardamom, cloves, fenugreek, nutmeg, mace, cumin,  coriander,  turmeric\nSweeteners: kithul jaggery, coconut jaggery, palmyrah jaggery\nVegetables and greens: gotukola, green papaya, snake beans, bitter melon, snake gourd, luffa, pumpkin, winged bean, moringa\nYams, roots and tubers: lotus root, purple yam, tapioca, kohila (Lasia spinosa), Arrowleaf elephant's ear\nOther: Coconut milk and grated coconut are ubiquitous in the cuisine, and are freshly prepared almost every day in most households. Maldives fish is heavily used in vegetable dishes to add an umami flavour.\n\n## Dishes\n\n\n### Rice and curry\nThe central feature of Sri Lankan cuisine is boiled or steamed rice, served with a curry of fish or meat, along with other curries made with vegetables, lentils, or fruits.\nDishes are accompanied by pickled fruits or vegetables, chutneys, and sambols. Coconut sambol is especially common, a paste of ground coconut mixed with chili peppers, dried Maldives fish, and lime juice.\n\n### Kiribath\nKiribath or paal soru (lit. 'milk rice')  is rice cooked in salted coconut milk until the grains turn soft and porridge-like. Generally eaten for breakfast, kiribath is also prepared on special occasions such as birthdays, New Years' and religious festivals. It is usually served with lunu miris, a relish made with red onions and chillies. There is also a method of cooking kiribath with mung beans. During Aluth Avurudu/Puthandu, the Sinhalese/Tamil New Year, kiribath is served with sweets such as kavum, kokis, mung kavum, od iba, and others.\n\n### Kottu\nKottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Colombo and literally means 'chopped roti'.\n\n### Hoppers\nHoppers (appam in Tamil, appa in Sinhala) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices.  The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can either be spicy (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Spicy hoppers are often accompanied by lunu miris, a mix of red onions and spices.\n\n### String hoppers\nString hoppers (idiyappam in Tamil) are made from a hot-water dough of rice meal or wheat flour. The dough is pressed out in circlets from a string mold onto small wicker mats, and then steamed. This dish is typically not eaten plain and is often paired with a curry, such as kiri hodi.\n\n### Lamprais\nA Dutch Burgher-influenced dish, lamprais is rice boiled in stock accompanied by frikkadels (frikadeller meatballs), a mixed-meat curry, blachan, aubergine curry, and seeni sambol.  All of this is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked in an oven. Lamprais is ideal for special occasions with large gatherings considering its richness and the time it takes to prepare. Lamprais is cooked twice; first the rice and the entrees are cooked separately and later what is already cooked is wrapped in a banana leaf and baked in an oven.\n\n### Kool\nKool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish.  It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour.\n\n### Pittu\nPittu are cylinders of steamed or roasted rice flour mixed with grated coconut.\n\n### Roti\nGodamba roti is a simpler Sri Lankan flatbread usually made from wheat flour.\nMost popular roti is  Pol roti, where shredded coconut is mixed into the dough, It doesn’t need yeast or any kind of a leavening agent. Another variant is spicy roti, in which chopped onions and green chilies are used when making the dough.\n\n### Sambal\nSambals (Sambol in Sinhala) are enjoyed with many dishes including curry dishes and string hoppers. Seeni sambol, Pol sambol, Lunumiris, Gotukola sambal and Vaalai kai sambal are common sambols found in the country.\n\n### Mallung\nMallung is a condiment or side dish, comprising chopped greens which are lightly cooked and mixed with grated coconut and red onions.\n\n### Malay achcharu\nMalay achcharu, also known as Sri Lankan Malay pickle or simply as achcharu is a dish that originated from the local Malay community and is now widely popular among all ethnic groups in the country. It is a selection of vegetables in a pickled sauce and blends sweet, sour and spicy flavours.\n\n### Sri Lankan Chinese\nChinese restaurants have been staple dining-out options for many Sri Lankans, especially in Colombo, since the 1940s. Over time, the cuisine was adapted to suit the local palate, and Sri Lankan Chinese food was born. Several dishes and condiments - such as Hot butter cuttlefish and Chinese Chili paste - have become firm local favorites and are commonly found in most restaurants and supermarkets.\n\n### Babath\nBabath or offal consists of the stomach of cattle or goats. It is cooked as a curry or deep fried and eaten with rice or more famously with Pittu. Its origins are associated with the Sri Lankan Malay community but it is very common among the Moors community as well. The preparation of babath also consists of Kodal or the intestines of the animal.\n\n### Sate\nSate is of Indonesian origin and has become a staple of the Sri Lankan diet. They are served with peanut and chili sauce.\n\n### Ekor sop\nEkor sop, oxtail soup, is a delicacy of the Sri Lankan Malay community.\n\n### Nasi goreng and mee goreng\nNasi goreng (Sinhala: නසි ගොරේඟ්) and mee goreng are popular street food dishes in the country, a result of cultural influences from Indonesia and the country's local Malay community.\n\n## Sweets\nA common dessert in Sri Lanka is kevum, an oil cake made with rice flour and treacle and deep-fried to a golden brown. There are many variations of kevum. Moong kevum is a variant in which mung bean flour is made into a paste and shaped like diamonds before frying. Other types of kevum include athiraha, konda kevum, athirasa, and handi kevum.\nA simple home dessert is buffalo curd, often served with kithul treacle.\nMany sweets are served with kiribath milk rice during the Sinhalese and Tamil New Years.\nOther sweets include:\nCakes and pastries:\n\nAluwa – Diamond-shaped rice-flour pastries\nBolo fiado – A Portuguese-style layer cake\nBibikkan – A rich, cake-like sweet made from grated coconut, coconut treacle, and wheat flour. It is a specialty of coastal areas.\nKokis – A savoury crispy biscuit-like dish made from rice flour and coconut milk.\nPushnambu/wandu appa – A rich, cake-like sweet made from coconut treacle and wheat flour. Cinnamon or cardamom and sweet cumin is often added among the Christian population of Sri Lanka.\nSeenakku – A glutinous rice cake often served with grated coconut.\nTreacle-flavored sweets:\n\nUndu walalu (undu wal) or pani walalu – A sweet from the Mathale area, prepared using urad bean flour and kithul treacle.\nAggala – Rice balls flavored with treacle.\nWeli thalapa – Made from rice flour and coconut treacle.\nAasmi – Made with rice flour and the juice of a leaf called dawul kurundu (okra juice can be used as a substitute), deep-fried and topped with pink-coloured treacle.\nPuddings and toffees:\n\nKalu dodol – A solid toffee-, jelly-like confection made by lengthy reduction of coconut milk, thickened with rice flour and sweetened with jaggery.\nWatalappam – A steamed pudding made with coconut milk, eggs, and jaggery. First introduced by Malay immigrants, watalappam has become a common Sri Lankan dessert.\nOther sweets:\n\nThala guli – Made from ground sesame, desiccated coconut, jaggery, and salt.\nKiri aluwa or milk toffee – Made with sweetened condensed milk or sugar-thickened pure cow's milk. Cardamom or sweet cumin and cashews are added for more taste.\n\n## Short eats\n\"Short eats\" (colloquially called \"shorties\") are a ubiquitous category of savory and sweet snacks in Sri Lanka, encompassing items such as patties, cutlets, rolls, samosas, pies, and buns. Though now deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan culture, their origins are a fusion of colonial culinary influences adapted and \"Sri Lankanised\" over the past 80 years. The diverse array of short eats reflects the island's history of foreign presence. European influences (British, Dutch, Portuguese) contributed pies, pastries, fish patties, and the likely ancestor of the breadcrumb-coated cutlet (from the Portuguese bolinho). Meanwhile Indians introduced samosas and vadais, while Chinese settler communities introduced the breadcrumb-coated \"Chinese roll,\" a spicy, deep-fried spring roll distinct from those found in China, similar to spring roll and egg roll. Actually Cutlet and Chinese roll are croquette.\nThe overarching concept of a mid-morning or afternoon snack to accompany tea was inspired by the English tradition of afternoon tea. The proliferation of short eats began in earnest during World War II (early 1940s), when bakeries expanded their offerings to cater to the significant European population. This initial adaptation for foreign palates gradually evolved into the distinctively Sri Lankan short eats known today.\nBy the 1960s, bakeries like Perera & Sons were widely selling these items. Their popularity expanded significantly in the 1970s, becoming a daily staple in Colombo and subsequently spreading across the island. The commercialization of Sri Lankan society in the 1980s further cemented their role as convenient and efficient food options for busy lifestyles. While derived from foreign concepts, short eats have been thoroughly transformed into a unique and enduring aspect of Sri Lankan culinary identity. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening.\nCommon short eats include:\n\nVade - savoury deep-fried fritters made from various ingredients. Varieties include parippu vade (lentils), ulundu vade (black gram and rice), isso (shrimp) vade, crab vade\nRolls or egg rolls, which often contain minced meats, potatoes, and vegetables. Meat options include chicken, mutton, seafood or just egg.\nFish patty\nPatties and pastries  - filled with vegetables, meat, or fish\nVegetable/fish roti - a flatbread with a filling rolled into a triangular shape and baked\nFish buns/Malu pan -  a brioche bun filled with a spicy potato and mackerel filling. Best for a savory breakfast or as a snack or to serve with tea.\nHot butter cuttlefish - fried cuttlefish in a spiced butter sauce\nShort eats are served at parties or to guests when they visit a home. Western food such as hot dogs and hamburgers have arrived in Sri Lanka, with the globalization of fast-food chains such as McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut. However, foods from these establishments are not usually considered short eats. Additionally, hot dogs and hamburgers are also modified to fit local tastes.\n\n## Beverages\nBeverages commonly served in Sri Lanka include:\n\nFaluda – a mixture of syrup, ice cream, jelly pieces and basil seeds, served cold\nFruit juice – including lime and passionfruit juice\nKing coconut water\nTea\nToddy – a mildly alcoholic drink made from palm tree sap\nArrack – an alcoholic spirit made from the fermented sap of the coconut flower.\nWood apple juice\n\n## See also\nIndian cuisine\nFaluda\nKottu\nPittu\nTraditional rice of Sri Lanka\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

Street food in Chennai is so popular that a game had developed based on the TV show The Amazing Race requiring contestants to follow clues to street-food spots in the city.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n### Idli sambhar\nIdli sambhar is made by steaming batter consisting of fermented de-husked black lentils and rice. Sambhar is a lentil-based vegetable stew or chowder based on a broth made with tamarind, common in South Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil cuisines.\nIt is also served with coconut chutney.\n\n### Dosa\nA dosa (plural: dosai) is a pancake made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crêpe but its main ingredients are rice and black gram. Dosai are a typical part of the South Indian diet but are known all over the Indian subcontinent. Masala dosa is served hot along with sambar, stuffed with potato masala (aloo masala) or paneer masala and chutney. It can be consumed with idli podi as well.\n\n### Uttapam\nUttapam or ooththappam or uthappa (Tamil: ஊத்தாப்பம் ) is a dosa-like dish made by cooking ingredients in a batter. Unlike a dosa, which is crisp and crepe-like, uttapam is a thick pancake, with toppings cooked right into the batter. Uttapam is traditionally made with toppings such as tomatoes, onion, chillies, capsicum and cabbage mix; other common choices are coconut or mixed vegetables. It is often eaten with sambar or chutney.\n\n### Paniyaram\nKuzhi paniyaram (Tamil: குழி பணியாரம்), or gunta ponganalu (Telugu: గుంట పొంగణాలు), or paddu, guliappa, or yeriyappa (Kannada:ಪಡ್ಡು/ಗುಳಿಯಪ್ಪ/ಎರಿಯಪ್ಪ), is an Indian dish made by steaming batter using a semi-spherical mould. The batter is made of black lentils and rice and is similar in composition to the batter used to make idli and dosa. The dish can be made sweet or spicy by addition of, respectively, jaggery and chillies. Paniyaram is made on a special pan that comes with multiple small fissures.\n\n### Vada\nVada [vəɽɑː] is a common term for many different types of savoury fried snacks from India. Different types of vadas can be described variously as fritters, doughnuts, or dumplings. Alternative names for this food include wada, vade, vadai, wadeh and bara. The various types of vadas are made from different ingredients, ranging from legumes (such as medu vada of South India) to potatoes (such as batata vada of West India). They are often eaten as breakfast or snack, and also used in other food preparations (such as dahi vada and vada pav).\n\n### Bhaji\nA bhaji, bhajji or bajji is a spicy snack or entrée similar to a fritter. It is often served with chutney.\n\n### Boli\nBoli in Tamil Nadu is a golden yellow sweet pancake from South India. It is eaten during a traditional Sadhya along with Pasam. Several varieties of boli are prepared including thenga (coconut) boli and jaggery,sugar. Boli is especially famous in the southernmost districts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, India and northern Sri Lanka. Boli is eaten mostly after lunch or as an evening snack. Boli is golden yellow in colour.\n\n### Jigarthanda\nJigarthanda is a cold milk beverage and cold dessert that originated in the South Indian city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu. It translates to \"cool heart\" in English. It is generally prepared and served at roadside stalls as a refreshment during the Indian summer. The basic ingredients include milk, almond gum, sarsaparilla root syrup, sugar and ice-cream.\n\n### Parotta\nA parotta, porotta or barotta, is a layered flat bread of parts of Southern India, notably in Tamil Nadu and Kerala made from maida flour. This is a similar to the North Indian Lacha paratha. Parottas are usually available as street food and in restaurants across Kerala, Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka. At some places it is also served at weddings, religious festivals and feasts. It is prepared by kneading maida, egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee and water. The dough is beaten into thin layers and later forming a round spiralled into a ball using these thin layers. The ball is rolled flat and roasted. There is one more special dish made out of parotta called Kothu parotta or mutta parotta which is widely available in mostly all Chennai hotels serving parottas.\n\n### Kothu parotta\nIt is a popular dish in small countryside hotels. The idea is to make the hard chewing parotta and also ease eating using only right hand. It is prepared by cutting regular poratha into pieces and mixing it with egg, onion, green chillies and garam masala. It is also normally made of leftover parotta and is famously had with alcoholic drinks.\n\n### Chili parotha\nIt is a variation of paratha which is popular as dinner. It is prepared by cutting the parotha into small pieces and frying it in pan with lot of chilli powder, tomatoes, capsicums & onions, the dish usually appears in bright red colour and parotha roasted as chip crisp.\n\n### Chapati\nChapatis are made using a soft dough comprising Atta flour, salt and water.

Traditionally, roti (and rice) are prepared without salt to provide a bland background for spiced dishes.\n\n### Idiyappam\nIdiyappam, or string hoppers, is a traditional Tamil, Kerala, Kodava, Tulu and Sri Lankan food consisting of rice flour pressed into noodle form and then steamed. Idiyappam is served with korma or Coconut milk.\n\n### Biriyani\nBiriyani is a hugely popular food in Chennai. It is a mixed rice food with meat. Variants include Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Egg Biriyani, Vegetarian Biryani, Beef Biriyani etc. Biryani is popular amongst Muslims, and so there is a theory that the Mughals brought it with them. Kushkas are Biriyanis without meat or meat removed from rice. Biryani is usually served with sour brinjal gravy (Baghara baingan) and chilled raita.\n\n### Kulfi\nKulfi has similarities to ice cream in appearance and taste; however it is denser and creamier. It comes in various flavours. The more traditional ones are cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio.\n\n### Atho\nChennai has a vibrant Tamil Community who migrated from Burma.

    "text": "# Street food of Mumbai\n\nStreet food of Mumbai  is the food sold by hawkers from portable market stalls in Mumbai. Although street food is common all over India, Mumbai is known for their street food and it's a strong characteristic of the city. It has this reputation because people from all economic classes eat on the roadside almost round the clock, and it is sometimes felt that the taste of street food is better than that of restaurants in the city. People of Mumbai, cutting across barriers of class, religion, gender, and ethnicity, are passionate about street food. Street food vendors are credited by some for developing the city's food culture. Street food in Mumbai is relatively inexpensive as compared to restaurants, and vendors tend to be clustered around crowded areas such as colleges and railway stations.\n\n## Variety\nMumbai, being the capital (and the largest urban area) of Maharashtra, is dominated by Maharashtrian food. Vada pav is noted as the most popular street food in Mumbai. A sandwich form of Eggs Kejriwal is also a very common snack or breakfast street food. Other noted street foods in Mumbai include Dabeli, panipuri, bhelpuri, sevpuri, dahipuri, sandwiches, ragda-pattice, pav bhaji, Chinese bhel, Khaman, Dhokla, idlis, and dosas, all of which are vegetarian.\nIn terms of non-vegetarian offerings, omelette-pav, kebabs, and fish are found on Mumbai streets. The amount and of variety of street food is attributed to the cosmopolitan culture of the city. In the 1980s, Indianised Chinese food was an emerging trend on Mumbai streets. Other popular street food items include Misal pav (spicy curry made of sprouted moth beans, which is eaten with paav, an Indian bread roll typically a bun), and vegetable frankie (a popular and cheaper version of wraps and rolls). \nKulfi (frozen dairy dessert, similar to ice cream) and golah (Indian snow cone, sometimes served on a stick) are among the desserts and coolants found on Mumbai streets. \nApart from snacks, Mumbai has several juice and milkshake bars on the roadside that offer a variety of juices and milkshakes. Fresh Sugarcane juice vendors are synonymous with Mumbai roads and offer a cheap form of refreshment. Tea vendors cycle around the city, selling the beverage hot on the streets. Street vendors normally remain unaffected by general strike calls and do business all year round. Paan, a betel leaf preparation eaten as a mouth freshener post meals in India is also sold at Mumbai's roadside stalls.\n\n## Areas and spread\nLanes with a sizable cluster of street food stalls are known as Khau Galli locally, which means 'Food Alley' in Marathi. Girgaum Chowpatty beach is noted for its Bhelpuri and kulfi. Street vendors at Nariman Point, one of the city's financial hubs, do brisk business during the lunch hour.\nMumbai's street food has made its way into the kitchens of restaurants in the city, including five star hotels. In fact, restaurants in various parts of the world have incorporated Mumbai's street food into their menu cards. Homegrown fast food companies that serve street food in Mumbai have been launched in recent years. Despite the many pros and cons of street food, it forms a daily diet of many office goers and college students in the city. Many Mumbaikars enjoy evening snacks on the roadside.\n\n## Controversies\nSome people avoid street food because of hygiene issues, however the larger public, irrespective of class enjoy Mumbai's street food. Restaurants and hotels have capitalised on this phenomenon by offering street food to their clientele. A large number of hawkers trade illegally, without mandatory permits from the local municipality, by bribing officials. Drives to evict hawkers are regularly held, though the hawkers return after a short period of time. Equipment and other goods seized from illegal hawkers are returned by the municipality after the hawker pays a fine. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in a case against illegal hawking by asking the municipality to demarcate 230 areas in the city as legal hawking zones, a number that was later increased to 1700 areas; this is still to be implemented. A news report in 2009 claimed that no hawking licenses had been issued in Mumbai for 20 years and that out of the estimated 250,000 hawkers in the city, only about 17,000 had a valid license.\nA controversy emerged in 2011, when a panipuri vendor from Thane was filmed urinating into a container that was also used to serve the customers. The event led to a public uproar and a major political drama in the city; Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena members again attacked North Indians, targeting the panipuri and bhelpuri sellers of Mumbai and Thane. The vendor was arrested, taken to court, fined and let off with a warning. After action against all panipuri vendors across the city by political parties, the vendor in question, who himself had been in the business for 15 years”, chose to give up the trade altogether and take up a job with a private security agency.\n\n## See also\nCulture of Mumbai\nStreet food of Kolkata\nStreet food of Chennai\nIndian fast food\nIndian cuisine\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Tandoor bread\n\nTandoor bread is a flat bread baked in a clay oven called a tandoor. The technique has been in use for some five thousand years in Central and West Asia and Northwest India. It may be leavened or unleavened. It is often round, but may be made as elongated oval lavash or canoe-shaped shotis puri. \nBecause of the expense of a tandoori oven, Indian villages used to share communal ovens. These have been replaced by the habit of bringing food to a local bakery to be baked there. An alternative is to use a wood- or charcoal-fueled oven or grill to give the food a smoky flavor recalling that of tandoor bread.\n\n## Etymology\nThe English word tandoor comes from Hindi/Urdu tandūr (तन्दूर / تندور), which derives from Persian tanūr (تنور) or tandūr (تندور). According to the Dehkhoda Persian Dictionary, the Persian word ultimately came from the Akkadian word tinūru (𒋾𒂟), which consists of the parts tin 'mud' and nuro/nura 'fire' and is mentioned as early as in the Akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh. Tandoor is called kandu in Sanskrit literature, in which tandoori parched, roasted cuisine is described as kandu pakva (grains, meat, etc. roasted in a tandoor) along with roasting on coal which has been called angara pakva.\n\n## History\nFood was first cooked in tandoor ovens some five thousand years ago. Remains of a clay oven with indication of cooked food have been excavated in the Indus River valley site of Kalibangan, and other places in present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, Iran, Iraq and Central Asia.\n\n## Varieties\n\n\n### West Asia\nThe Arabic name for tandoor bread is ḵubz al-tannūr ('bread of the tannur' Arabic: خبز التنور). In some places where it is especially common, such as Iraq, it may be called simply khubz (bread). \nIn Iran, tandoor breads are known as nân-e-tanūri (Persian: نان تنوری). Varieties include nân-e barbari (Persian: نان بربری), tâftun (تافتون), and shirmal (شیرمال).\n\nIn Georgia and Armenia, a traditional tandoor is called a tone (Georgian: თონე) and tʿonir (Armenian: թոնիր), and the bread baked in the tone is called tonis ṗuri (Georgian: თონის პური or tʿonir hacʿ Armenian: թոնիր հաց).\nCanoe-shaped shoti (Georgian: შოთი) is a kind of tonis ṗuri.\nLavash (Armenian: լավաշ lavaš, Georgian: ლავაში lavaši) is a tandoor bread eaten in this region.\n\n### Central Asia\nIn Central Asia, tandyr nan (Kazakh/Kyrgyz: тандыр-нан tandır-nan, Uzbek: tandir non, Uyghur: تونۇر نان tonur nan, Tajik: нони танурй noni tanuri) is made and eaten.\n\n### South Asia\nTandoor breads are popular in northwestern Indian regions, where naan breads and atta flatbreads such as the Tandoori roti are baked in tandoor clay ovens fired by wood or charcoal. These naans are known as tandoori naan (Gujarati: તંદૂરી નાન, Hindi: तंदूरी नान).\nTandoor ovens are not common in the average Indian home because they are expensive to fabricate, install and maintain. Authentic tandoori cuisine in urban areas can often be found in specialty restaurants. However, in rural areas in India such as Punjab, the tandoor oven is considered a social institution, for a tandoor oven is shared among the community. Women would go to the oven place with atta along with their marinated meats to meet their neighbors and friends, so they could converse and share stories while waiting for their food to cook. The people in cities once engaged in this social activity, but as businesses and commercialism grew in these areas, communal tandoor ovens became rare. Not uncommonly, people bring food to their local bakeries to cook it there at a fair price. Because of this, people have developed ingenious techniques to replicate the cooking process and the food without the use of the oven. Common alternatives include an oven or a grill fueled by charcoal or wood so the food will be infused with the smoky flavor.\nIn Pakistani cuisine, tandoor breads are a staple across the country. These range from a simple unleavened Tandoori roti, to yeast-based khamiri roti, as well as richer and more complex (yeast, milk, egg, etc.-based) naans and kulcha breads.\nTandoor bread is gaining popularity in Asia, North America (outside of the Caribbean) and Europe due to the Indian diaspora during British colonialism.\n\n### Caribbean\nTandoor bread is found in Caribbean countries such as Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago (as roti).\n\n## Physical and chemical composition\nAroma, smell, appearance, color, size and overall texture are the general characteristics that are optimized by producers of tandoor bread. The texture and quality of tandoor bread are determined by the percentage of wheat protein, the number of essential amino acids and the type of flour present in the bread. Various studies have demonstrated that the chemical and biochemical composition of flour affects the flour's ability to interact with the other ingredients in tandoor bread.\nResponse surface methodology is a process which allows for the development of palatable tandoor breads that have a long shelf life and contain minimal amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which may pose health hazards. For optimal sensory and chemical stability of tandoor bread, the water level is 720 milliliters per kilogram, protein concentrations range from 10.3% to 11.5%, between 1.2 and 1.6% salt is added, and the bread is baked in temperatures ranging from 330 to 450 °C.\n\n## See also\nPrimitive clay oven\nWood-fired oven\nSamsa (food)\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Tandoori chicken\n\nTandoori chicken is a dish made from chicken marinated in yogurt and spices and roasted in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The dish is now popular worldwide. The modern form of the dish was popularised by the Moti Mahal restaurant in New Delhi, India in the late 1940s.\n\n## History\nChicken roasted in tandoor-like ovens is documented in the Harappan civilisation of the Bronze Age of Indian subcontinent, as early as 3000 BC. Much later, the Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after being seasoned with black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices.\nTandoori chicken as a dish originated in the Punjab before the independence of partition of India. In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was popularised at Moti Mahal in the locality of Daryaganj in New Delhi by Kundan Lal Jaggi, Kundan Lal Gujral and Thakur Das Magu, who were Punjabi Hindu migrants from Peshawar as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant. They used to work at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba in Peshawar, British India, from the 1920s to 1947.\nTandoori chicken was popularised in post-independence India by Moti Mahal, Daryaganj in Delhi when it was served to the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. There, tandoori chicken became a standard offering at official banquets.\nIn the United States, tandoori chicken began appearing on menus by the 1960s. Jacqueline Kennedy was reported to have eaten \"chicken tandoori\" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962. A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed in the Los Angeles Times in 1963, for \"the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner\"; a similar recipe was featured in the same newspaper in 1964.\n\n## Preparation\nRaw chicken parts are skinned then marinated in a mixture of dahi (yogurt) and tandoori masala, a spice blend. They are seasoned and coloured with cayenne pepper, red chilli powder, or Kashmiri red chilli powder as well as turmeric or food colouring.\nThe marinated chicken is placed on skewers and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven, which is heated with charcoal or wood, which adds to the smoky flavour. The dish can also be cooked in a standard oven, using a spit or rotisserie, or over hot charcoal.\nThere are also tandoori recipes for whole chicken, some of which are cooked in a tandoor and others over charcoal. These include Chirga (Roasted whole chicken); Tandoori Murgh (Roast whole chicken with almonds); Murgh Kabab Seekhi (Whole stuffed chicken on the spit); Kookarh Tandoori (Steamed chicken on spit); Tandoori Murgh Massaledarh (Whole spiced chicken on spit); and Murghi Bhogar (Chicken in the Bhogar style).\n\n## Cuisine\nTandoori chicken can be eaten as a starter or appetiser, or as a main course, often served with naan flatbread. It is also used as the base of numerous cream-based curries, such as butter chicken.\n\n## Variations\nThe fame of tandoori chicken led to many derivatives, such as chicken tikka (and eventually the Indian dish popularised in Britain, chicken tikka masala), commonly found in menus in Indian restaurants all over the world. Nearly all derivatives of tandoori chicken begin with a yogurt and citrus-based marinade.\n\n## See also\nIndian cuisine\nList of chicken dishes\nPakistani cuisine\nPunjabi cuisine\nTandoori masala\nButter chicken\n\n## Notes\n\n\n## References\n\n\n## External links\n\nTandoori Chicken\nChicken tandoori recipe Archived 29 September 2023 at the Wayback Machine by Taajrecipes blog\nCook's Illustrated.

Thai cuisine is defined by its characteristic balance of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavors using fresh ingredients, aromatic herbs, and techniques like stir frying, steaming and deep frying.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Historical influences\nThai cuisine and the culinary traditions and cuisines of Thailand's neighbors, especially Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Malaysia and Indonesia, have influenced one another over the course of many centuries.\nAccording to the Thai monk Venerable Buddhadasa Bhikku's writing, ‘India's Benevolence to Thailand’, Thai cuisine was influenced by Indian cuisine. He wrote that Thai people learned how to use spices in their food in various ways from Indians. Thais also obtained the methods of making herbal medicines from the Indians. Some plants like sarabhi of the family Guttiferae, panika or harsinghar, phikun or Mimusops elengi and bunnak or the rose chestnut etc. were brought from India. According to the book Mae Khrua Hua Pa (first published in 1908) by Lady Plian Bhaskarawongse, she found that Thai cuisine had a strong gastronomical cultural line from Sukhothai (1238–1448) through Ayuttthaya (1351–1767) and Thonburi period (1767–1782) vis-à-vis Siamese governmental officers' daily routines (such as royal cooking) and their related cousins. Thai food during the Thonburi period tended to be more similar to that from the Ayutthaya period, except the addition of Chinese food resulted from her prosperous international trade.\n\nWestern influences, starting in 1511 when the first diplomatic mission from the Portuguese arrived at the court of Ayutthaya, have created dishes such as foi thong, the Thai adaptation of the Portuguese fios de ovos, and sangkhaya, where coconut milk replaces cow's milk in making a custard. These dishes were said to have been brought to Thailand in the 17th century by Maria Guyomar de Pinha, a woman of mixed Japanese-Portuguese-Bengali ancestry who was born in Ayutthaya, and became the wife of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adviser to King Narai. The most notable influence from the West must be the introduction of the chili pepper from the Americas in the 16th or 17th century. It, and rice, are now two of the most important ingredients in Thai cuisine. During the Columbian Exchange, Portuguese and Spanish ships brought new foodstuffs from the Americas including tomatoes, corn, papaya, pea eggplants, pineapple, pumpkins, culantro, cashews, and peanuts.\n\n### Regional variations\nRegional variations tend to correlate to neighboring states (often sharing the same cultural background and ethnicity on both sides of the border) as well as climate and geography. Northern Thai cuisine shares dishes with Shan State in Burma, northern Laos, and also with Yunnan Province in China, whereas the cuisine of Isan (northeastern Thailand) is similar to that of Southern Laos, and by Vietnamese cuisine to its east. Southern Thailand, with many dishes that contain liberal amounts of coconut milk and fresh turmeric, has that in common with Indian, Malaysian, and Indonesian cuisine.\nThai cuisine is more accurately described as five regional cuisines, corresponding to the five main regions of Thailand:\n\nBangkok: cuisine of the Bangkok metropolitan area, with Teochew and Portuguese influences. In addition, as a capital city, Bangkok cuisine is sometimes influenced by more dedicated royal cuisine. Tastes and looks of food in Bangkok have changed somewhat over time as they have been influenced by other cuisines such as Asian, European or Western countries.\nCentral Thai: cuisine of the flat and wet central rice-growing plains, site of the former Thai kingdoms of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya, and the Dvaravati culture of the Mon people from before the arrival of Siamese in the area. Coconut milk is one of major ingredients used in Central Thai cuisine.\nIsan or Northeastern Thai: cuisine of the more arid Khorat Plateau, influenced by the culture of Laos and also by Khmer cuisine.\nNorthern Thai: cuisine of the cooler valleys and forested mountains of the Thai highlands, once ruled by the former Lanna Kingdom and home of Lannaese, the majority of northern Thailand. This cuisine shares many ingredients with Isan.\nSouthern Thai: cuisine of the Kra Isthmus which is bordered on two sides by tropical seas, with its many islands and including the ethnic Malay, former Sultanate of Pattani in the deep south. The complex curries, food preparation techniques and usage of chillies and spices in Southern Thai cuisine form a great influence on the whole cuisine in general.\n\n### Royal cuisine\nIn addition to these regional cuisines, there is also Thai royal cuisine which can trace its history back to the cosmopolitan palace cuisine of the Ayutthaya kingdom (1351–1767 CE). Its refinement, cooking techniques, presentation, and use of ingredients were of great influence to the cuisine of the central Thai plains. Thai royal cuisine has been influenced by the Khmer royal cuisine through the Khmer palace cooks brought to the Ayutthaya Kingdom during its conquests of the Khmer Empire. Thai royal cuisine has become very well known from the Rattanakosin Era onwards.\nTypically, Thai royal cuisine has basic characteristics that are close to the basic food prepared by general people. However, Thai royal cuisine focuses on the freshness of seasonal products. Other than that, it is crucial that the way in which Thai royal food is cooked should be complex and delicate.\nLa Loubère, an envoy from France during the reign of King Narai, recorded that the food at the court was generally similar to villager food. What makes Thai royal cuisine different food is its beautiful presentation. For example, they served fish and chicken with the bones removed, and the vegetables were served in bite-sized portions. In addition, if beef is used, it should be tenderloin only.\n\nThere are many types of Thai royal cuisine such as ranchuan curry, nam phrik long ruea, matsaman curry, rice in jasmine-flavored iced water or khao chae, spicy salad, fruit, and carved vegetable.\nThai chef McDang, himself descended from the royal family, asserts that the difference between royal Thai cuisine and regular Thai cuisine is fiction. He maintains that the only difference between the food of the palace and that of the common people is the former's elaborate presentation and better ingredients.\n\n## Serving\nThai food was traditionally eaten with the hand while seated on mats or carpets on the floor or coffee table in upper middle class families, customs still found in more traditional households. Today, however, most Thais eat with a fork and spoon. Tables and chairs were introduced as part of a broader Westernization drive during the reign of King Mongkut, Rama IV. The fork and spoon were introduced by King Chulalongkorn after his return from a tour of Europe in 1897 CE.\nImportant to Thai dining is the practice of  khluk, mixing the flavors and textures of different dishes with the rice from one's plate. The food is pushed by the fork, held in the left hand, into the spoon held in the right hand, which is then brought to the mouth. A traditional ceramic spoon is sometimes used for soup, and knives are not generally used at the table. It is common practice for both the Thais and the hill tribe peoples who live in Lanna and Isan to use sticky rice as an edible implement by shaping it into small, and sometimes flattened, balls by hand (and only the right hand by custom) which are then dipped into side dishes and eaten.\n\nChopsticks were foreign utensils to most ethnic groups in Thailand with the exception of the Thai Chinese, and a few other cultures such as the Akha people, who are recent arrivals from Yunnan Province, China. Traditionally, the majority of ethnic Thai people ate with their hands like the people of India. Chopsticks are mainly used in Thailand for eating Chinese-style noodle soups, or at Chinese, Japanese, or Korean restaurants. Stir-fried noodle dishes such as drunken noodles, pad see ew, and pad thai, and curry-noodle dishes such as khanom chin nam ngiao, are also eaten with a fork and spoon in the Thai fashion.\nThai meals typically consist of rice (khao in Thai) with many complementary dishes shared by all. The dishes are all served at the same time, including the soups, and it is also customary to provide more dishes than there are guests at a table. A Thai family meal would normally consist of rice with several dishes which should form a harmonious contrast of flavors and textures as well as preparation methods. Traditionally, a meal would have at least five elements: a dip or relish for raw or cooked vegetables (khrueang chim) is the most crucial component of any Thai meal. Khrueang chim, considered a building block of Thai food by Chef McDang, may come in the form of a spicy chili sauce or relish called nam phrik (made of raw or cooked chilies and other ingredients, which are then mashed together), or a type of dip enriched with coconut milk called lon. The other elements would include a clear soup (perhaps a spicy tom yam or a mellow tom chuet), a curry or stew (essentially any dish identified with the kaeng prefix), a deep-fried dish, and a stir-fried dish of meat, fish, seafood, or vegetables.\n\nIn most Thai restaurants, diners will have access to a selection of Thai sauces (nam chim) and condiments, either brought to the table by wait staff or present at the table in small containers. These may include phrik nam pla/nam pla phrik (fish sauce, lime juice, chopped chilies and garlic), dried chili flakes, sweet chili sauce, sliced chili peppers in rice vinegar, Sriracha sauce, and even sugar. With certain dishes, such as khao kha mu (pork trotter stewed in soy sauce and served with rice), whole Thai peppers and raw garlic are served in addition to the sour chili sauce. Cucumber is sometimes eaten to cool the mouth with particularly spicy dishes. They often feature as a garnish, especially with one-dish meals. The plain rice, sticky rice or the khanom chin (Thai rice noodles) served alongside a spicy Thai curry or stir-fry, tends to counteract the spiciness.\nWhen time is limited or when eating alone, single dishes, such as fried rice or noodle soups, are quick and filling. An alternative is to have one or more smaller helpings of curry, stir fries and other dishes served together on one plate with a portion of rice. This style of serving food is called khao rat kaeng (lit. 'rice covered with curry'), or for short khao kaeng (lit. 'rice curry'). Eateries and shops that specialize in pre-made food are the usual place to go to for having a meal this way. These venues have a large display showing the different dishes one can choose. When placing an order at these places, Thais will state if they want the food served as separate dishes or together on one plate with rice (rat khao). Very often, regular restaurants will also feature a selection of freshly made \"rice curry\" dishes on their menu for single customers.\n\n## Ingredients\nThai cuisine, as a whole, features many different ingredients (suan phasom; Thai: ส่วนผสม), and ways of preparing food. Thai chef McDang characterises Thai food as having \"intricacy, attention to detail, texture, color, and taste.\nThai food is known for its enthusiastic use of fresh (rather than dried) herbs and spices. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemongrass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain Borassus palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat, lamb, and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais in Southern Thailand. Game, such as wild boar, deer and wild birds, are now less common due to loss of habitat, the introduction of modern methods of intensive animal farming in the 1960s, and the rise of agribusinesses, such as Thai Charoen Pokphand Foods, in the 1980s. Traditionally, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish play an important role in the diet of Thai people. In 2006 the per capita consumption of fish was 33.6 kg. Anna Leonowens (of The King and I fame) observed in her book The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870):\n\n\"The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavour, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its platoo, a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the labourer's bowl of rice.\"\nFreshwater varieties come from the many rivers, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields inland, and seafood from the tropical seas of the southern half of the country. Some species, such as the giant river prawn, need brackish water as juveniles but live out their lives in freshwater once mature. Aquaculture of species such as Nile tilapia, catfish, tiger prawns, and blood cockles, now generates a large portion of the seafood sold in, and exported from Thailand.\n\n### Rice, noodles and starches\nLike most other Asian cuisines, rice is the staple grain of Thai cuisine. According to Thai food expert McDang, rice is the first and most important part of any meal, and the words for rice and food are the same: khao. As in many other rice eating cultures, to say \"eat rice\" (in Thai \"kin khao\", pronounced [kīn kʰâːw]) means to eat food.\nRice is such an integral part of the diet that a common Thai greeting is \"kin khao rue yang?\" (lit. '\"have you eaten rice yet?').\nThai farmers historically have cultivated tens of thousands of rice varieties. The traditional recipe for a rice dish could include as many as 30 varieties of rice. That number has been drastically reduced due to genetic modifications.\nNon-glutinous rice (Oryza sativa) is called khao chao (lit. 'royal rice'). One type, which is indigenous to Thailand, is the highly prized, sweet-smelling jasmine rice (khao hom mali). This naturally aromatic long-grained rice grows in abundance in the patchwork of paddy fields that blanket Thailand's central plains. Once the rice is steamed or cooked, it is called khao suai (lit. 'beautiful rice'). Non-glutinous rice is used for making fried rice dishes, and for congee, of which there are three main varieties: khao tom (a thin rice soup, most often with minced pork or fish), khao tom kui (a thick, unflavored rice porridge that is served with side dishes), or chok (a thick rice porridge that is flavored with broth and minced meat).\n\nOther varieties of rice eaten in Thailand include: sticky rice (khao niao), a unique variety of rice which contains an unusual balance of the starches present in all rice, causing it to cook up to a sticky texture. Thai Red Cargo rice, an unpolished long grain rice with an outer deep reddish-brown color and a white center, has a nutty taste and is slightly chewy compared to the soft and gummy texture of jasmine rice. Only the husks of the red rice grains are removed which allows it to retain all its nutrients and vitamins, but unlike brown rice, its red color comes from antioxidants in the bran. Black sticky rice is a type of sticky rice with a deep purple-red color that may appear black. Another unpolished grain, black sticky rice has a rich nutty flavor that is most often used in desserts.\nNoodles in Thailand are usually made from the flour of rice, wheat, or mung bean. Perhaps one of the oldest type of noodle in Thailand is khanom chin, which is a fresh type of rice vermicelli made from fermented rice, and eaten with toppings like green curry (kaeng khiao wan) with chicken or in green papaya salad (som tam). Other noodle varieties were subsequently introduced by Chinese migrants to Thailand, as is testified by their Sino-Thai name kuaitiao (ก๋วยเตี๋ยว; Chinese: 粿條; pinyin: guǒtiáo). The three most common rice varieties of kuaitiao are sen yai (เส้นใหญ่) wide flat noodles, sen lek (เส้นเล็ก) narrow flat noodles, and sen mi เส้นหมี่; or rice vermicelli), which are round and thin. A fourth popular variety, bami (บะหมี่; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: bah-mī) is made from egg and wheat flour and is usually sold fresh. Bami are similar to the Teochew mee pok. A fifth type, wun sen (วุ้นเส้น; lit. 'jelly strands'), called cellophane noodles or glass noodles in English, are thin round noodles made from mung bean flour which are sold dried. Lastly, and least common in noodle shops, are \"silver needle noodles\" kiam-i (เกี้ยมอี๋), a somewhat thick round rice noodle similar in size and shape to bean sprouts. Thai noodle dishes, whether stir fried like pad thai or in the form of a noodle soup, usually come as an individual serving and are not meant to be shared and eaten communally.\nRice flour (paeng khao chao) and tapioca flour (paeng man sampalang) are often used in desserts or as thickening agents.\n\n### Pastes and sauces\nAn ingredient found in many Thai dishes and used in every region of the country is nam pla, a clear fish sauce that is very aromatic. Fish sauce is a staple ingredient in Thai cuisine and imparts a unique character to Thai food. Fish sauce is prepared with fermented fish that is made into a fragrant condiment and provides a salty flavor. There are many varieties of fish sauce and many variations in the way it is prepared. Some fish may be fermented with shrimp or spices. Another type of sauce made from fermented fish is pla ra. It is more pungent than nam pla, and, in contrast to nam pla, which is a clear liquid, pla ra is opaque and often contains pieces of fish. To add this sauce to a som tam (spicy papaya salad) is a matter of choice. Kapi, Thai shrimp paste, is a combination of fermented ground shrimp and salt. It is used in the famous chili paste called nam phrik kapi, in rice dishes such as khao khluk kapi and it is indispensable for making Thai curry pastes. Tai pla is a pungent sauce used in the southern Thai cuisine, that is made from the fermented innards of the short mackerel (pla thu). It is one of the main condiments of kaeng tai pla curry and is also used to make nam phrik tai pla. Far removed from the nearest sea, from northern Thailand comes nam pu, a thick, black paste made by boiling mashed rice-paddy crabs for hours. It is used as an ingredient for certain northern Thai salads, curries, and chili pastes. It too has a strong and pungent flavor.\n\nNam phrik are Thai chili pastes, similar to the Indonesian and Malaysian sambals. Each region has its own special versions. The words \"nam phrik\" are used by Thais to describe many pastes containing chilies used for dipping, although the more watery versions tend to be called nam chim. Thai curry pastes are normally called phrik kaeng or khrueang kaeng (lit. 'curry ingredients'), but some people also use the word nam phrik to designate a curry paste. Red curry paste, for instance, could be called phrik kaeng phet or khrueang kaeng phet in Thai, but also nam phrik kaeng phet. Both nam phrik and phrik kaeng are prepared by crushing together chilies with various ingredients such as garlic and shrimp paste using a mortar and pestle. Some nam phrik are served as a dip with vegetables such as cucumbers, cabbage and yard-long beans, either raw or blanched. One such paste is nam phrik num, a paste of pounded fresh green chilies, shallots, garlic and coriander leaves. The sweet roasted chili paste called nam phrik phao is often used as an ingredient in tom yam or when frying meat or seafood, and it is also popular as a spicy \"jam\" on bread, or served as a dip with prawn crackers. The dry nam phrik kung, made with pounded dried shrimp (kung haeng), is often eaten plain with rice and a few slices of cucumber. French diplomat Simon de la Loubère observed that chili pastes were vital for the way Thai people eat. He provides us with a recipe for nam phrik with pla ra and onions in Du Royaume de Siam, an account of his mission to Thailand published in 1691.\nThe soy sauces which are used in Thai cuisine are of Chinese origin, and the Thai names for them are (wholly or partially) loanwords from the Teochew dialect: si-io dam (black soy sauce), si-io khao (light soy sauce), si-io wan (sweet soy sauce), and taochiao (fermented whole soy beans). Namman hoi (oyster sauce) is also of Chinese origin. It is used extensively in vegetable and meat stir fries.\nSatay is also common in Thailand, grilled or skewered meat served with a spicy peanut dipping sauce made from roasted or fried peanuts.\n\n### Vegetables, herbs and spices\nThai dishes use a wide variety of herbs, spices and leaves rarely found in the West. The characteristic flavor of kaffir lime leaves (bai makrut) appears in many Thai soups (e.g., the hot and sour tom yam) or curry from the southern and central areas of Thailand. The Thai lime (manao) is smaller, darker and sweeter than the kaffir lime, which has a rough looking skin with a stronger lime flavor. Kaffir lime leaves or rind is frequently combined with galangal (kha) and lemongrass (takhrai), either kept whole in simmered dishes or blended together with liberal amounts of chilies and other aromatics to make curry paste. Fresh Thai basil, distinctively redolent of cloves, and with stems which are often tinged with a purple color, are used to add fragrance in certain dishes such as green curry. Other commonly used herbs in Thai cuisine include phak chi, (coriander or cilantro leaves), rak phak chi (cilantro/coriander roots), spearmint (saranae), holy basil (kaphrao), ginger (khing), turmeric (khamin), fingerroot (krachai), culantro (phak chi farang), pandanus leaves (bai toei), and Thai lemon basil (maenglak). Spices and spice mixtures used in Thai cuisine include phong phalo (five-spice powder), phong kari (curry powder), and fresh and dried peppercorns (phrik thai). Northern Thai larb uses a very elaborate spice mix, called phrik lap, which includes ingredients such as cumin, cloves, long pepper, star anise, prickly ash seeds and cinnamon.\n\nBesides kaffir lime leaves, several other tree leaves are used in Thai cuisine such as cha-om, the young feathery leaves of the Acacia pennata tree. These leaves can be cooked in omelettes, soups and curries or eaten raw in northern Thai salads. Banana leaves are often used as packaging for ready-made food or as steamer cups such as in ho mok pla, a spicy steamed pâté or soufflé made with fish and coconut milk. Banana flowers are also used in Thai salads or as a vegetable ingredient for certain curries. The leaves and flowers of the neem tree (sadao) are also eaten blanched. Phak lueat (leaves from the Ficus virens) are cooked in curries, and bai makok (from the Spondias mombin) can be eaten raw with a chili paste.\nFive main chilies are generally used as ingredients in Thai food. One chili is very small (about 1.25 centimetres (0.49 in)) and is known as the hottest chili: phrik khi nu suan (\"garden mouse-dropping chili\"). The slightly larger chili phrik khi nu (\"mouse-dropping chili\") is the next hottest. The green or red phrik chi fa (\"sky pointing chili\") is slightly less spicy than the smaller chilies. The very large  phrik yuak, which is pale green in color, is the least spicy and used more as a vegetable. Lastly, the dried chilies: phrik haeng are spicier than the two largest chilies and dried to a dark red color.\n\nOther typical ingredients are the several types of eggplant (makhuea) used in Thai cuisine, such as the pea-sized makhuea phuang and the egg-sized makhuea suai, often also eaten raw. Although broccoli is often used in Asian restaurants in the west in phat phak ruam (stir fried mixed vegetables) and rat na (rice noodles served in gravy), it was never used in any traditional Thai food in Thailand and was rarely seen in Thailand. Usually in Thailand, khana is used, for which broccoli is a substitute. Other vegetables which are often eaten in Thailand are thua fak yao (yardlong beans), thua ngok (bean sprouts), no mai (bamboo shoots), tomatoes, cucumbers, phak tam lueng (Coccinia grandis), phak kha na (Chinese kale), phak kwangtung (choy sum), sweet potatoes (both the tuber and leaves), a few types of squash, phak krathin (Leucaena leucocephala), sato (Parkia speciosa), tua phū (winged beans) and khaophot (corn).\nAmong the green, leafy vegetables and herbs that are usually eaten raw in a meal or as a side dish in Thailand, the most important are: phak bung (morning glory), horapha (Thai basil), bai bua bok (Asian pennywort), phak kachet (water mimosa), phak kat khao (Chinese cabbage), phak phai (praew leaves), phak kayang (rice paddy herb), phak chi farang (culantro), phak tiu (Cratoxylum formosum), phak \"phaai\" (yellow burr head) and kalamplī (cabbage). Some of these leaves are highly perishable and must be used within a couple of days.\nSeveral types of mushroom (het) also feature in Thai cuisine such as straw mushrooms (het fang), shiitake (het hom), and white jelly fungus (het hu nu khao).\nFlowers are also commonly used ingredients in many Thai dishes, either as a vegetable, such as dok khae (Sesbania grandiflora) and huapli (the flower bud of the banana), or as a food coloring, such as with the blue-colored dok anchan (the flowers of the Clitoria ternatea, which can also be eaten raw or fried).\n\n### Fruits\nFresh fruit forms a large part of the Thai diet, and are customarily served after a meal as dessert. The Scottish author John Crawfurd, sent on an embassy to Bangkok in 1822, writes in his account of the journey:\n\"The fruits of Siam, or at least of the neighbourhood of Bangkok, are excellent and various, surpassing, according to the experience of our party (...) those of all other parts of India.\" The Siamese themselves consume great quantities of fruit, and the whole neighbourhood of Bangkok is one forest of fruit trees.\n\nFruit is not only eaten on its own, but often served with spicy dips made from sugar, salt, and chilies. Fruits feature in spicy salads such as som tam (green papaya salad) and yam som-o (pomelo salad), in soups with tamarind juice such as tom khlong and kaeng som, and in Thai curries such as kaeng khanun (jackfruit curry), kaeng phet pet yang (grilled duck curry with pineapple or grapes), and kaeng pla sapparot (fish and pineapple curry). Fruits are also used in certain Thai chili pastes, such as in nam phrik long rue made with  madan (a close relative of the mangosteen), and nam phrik luk namliap, salted black Chinese olive chilli paste.\nAlthough many of the exotic fruits of Thailand may have been sometimes unavailable in Western countries, Asian markets now import such fruits as rambutan and lychees. In Thailand one can find papaya, jackfruit, mango, mangosteen, langsat, longan, pomelo, pineapple, rose apples, durian, Burmese grapes and other native fruits. Chanthaburi in Thailand each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand and a quarter of the world production. The Langsat Festival is held each year in Uttaradit on weekends in September. The langsat (Lansium parasiticum), for which Uttaradit is famous, is a fruit that is similar in taste to the longan.\n\nFrom the coconut comes coconut milk, used both in curries and desserts, and coconut oil. The juice of a green coconut can be served as a drink and the young flesh is eaten in either sweet or savory dishes. The grated flesh of a mature coconut is used raw or toasted in sweets, salads and snacks such as miang kham. Thais not only consume products derived from the nut (actually a drupe), but they also make use of the growth bud of the palm tree as a vegetable. From the stalk of the flowers comes a sap that can be used to make coconut vinegar, alcoholic beverages, and sugar. Coconut milk and other coconut-derived ingredients feature heavily in the cuisines of central and southern Thailand. In contrast to these regions, coconut palms do not grow as well in northern and northeastern Thailand, where in wintertime the temperatures are lower and where there is a dry season that can last five to six months. In northern Thai cuisine, only a few dishes, most notably the noodle soup khao soi, use coconut milk. In the southern parts of northeastern Thailand, where the region borders Cambodia, one can again find dishes containing coconut. It is also here that the people eat non-glutinous rice, just as in central and southern Thailand, and not glutinous rice as they do in northern Thailand and in the rest of northeastern Thailand.\nApples, pears, peaches, grapes, and strawberries, which do not traditionally grow in Thailand and in the past had to be imported, have become increasingly popular in the last few decades since they were introduced to Thai farmers by the Thai Royal Projects, starting in 1969, and the Doi Tung Project since 1988. These temperate fruit grow especially well in the cooler, northern Thai highlands, where they were initially introduced as a replacement for the cultivation of opium, together with other crops such as cabbages, tea, and arabica coffee.\n\n### Food controversies\n\n\n## Representative dishes\nWhereas many Thai dishes are now familiar in the West, the vast majority are not. In many of the dishes below, different kinds of protein, or combinations of protein, are interchangeable as the main ingredient. Beef (nuea), chicken (kai), pork (mu), duck (pet), tofu (taohu), fish (pla), prawns or shrimp (kung), crab (pu), shellfish (hoi), or egg (khai) can, for example, all be used as main ingredients for kaeng phet (red curry). Thus kaeng phet kai is red curry with chicken and kaeng phet mu is red curry made with pork.\n\n### Breakfast dishes\nKhao chao (Thai: ข้าวเช้า; lit. 'morning rice/food'), breakfast dishes, for Thais are limited. Very often, a Thai breakfast can consist of the same dishes with rice which are also eaten for lunch or dinner. Single dishes such as fried rice, noodle soups, and steamed rice with something simple such as an omelette, fried/grilled pork or chicken, or a stir fry with vegetables, are commonly sold for breakfast from street stalls as a quick take-out.\nThe following dishes are viewed as being specific breakfast dishes but they can also be found at any other moment of the day:\n\nChok – a rice porridge commonly eaten in Thailand for breakfast. Similar to the rice congee eaten in other parts of Asia.\nKhao khai chiao – an omelet (khai chiao) with white rice, often eaten with a chili sauce and slices of cucumber.\nKhao tom – a Thai style rice soup, usually with pork, chicken, fish, or shrimp.\nPathongko – The Thai version of the Chinese deep-fried bread called youtiao. It can be topped up with spreads such as sangkhaya or with chocolate and sweetened condensed milk.\nNam taohu – Soy milk which is often served with sweet jellies.\n\n### Individual dishes\nThe term ahan chan diao (Thai: อาหารจานเดียว; lit. 'single dish food') represents truly single-plate dishes as well as dishes that are served \"rat khao\" (lit. 'poured on rice'): one or more dishes served together with rice on one plate. Some eateries offer a large selection of (pre-cooked) dishes; others specialize in only one dish, or a few dishes, with rice.\n\nPhat kaphrao mu rat khao – minced pork fried with chilies, garlic, soy sauce and holy basil, served together with rice, and with nam pla phrik as a condiment.\nKhanom chin kaeng kiao wan kai – fresh Thai rice noodles (khanom chin) served in a bowl with green chicken curry as a sauce. Raw vegetables, herbs, and fish sauce are served on the side and can be added to taste.\nKhanom chin nam ngiao – A specialty of northern Thailand, it is Thai fermented rice noodles served with pork blood tofu and raw vegetables, in a sauce made with pork broth and tomato, crushed fried dry chilies, chicken blood, dry fermented soy bean, and dried red kapok flowers.\nKhanom chin namya – round boiled rice noodles topped with a fish-based sauce and eaten with fresh leaves and vegetables.\nKhao kha mu – steamed rice served with red-cooked pork leg, steamed mustard greens, pickled cabbage, sweet-sour chili sauce, raw garlic, fresh bird's eye chilies, and boiled egg.\nKhao khluk kapi – rice stir-fried with shrimp paste, served with sweetened pork and vegetables.\nKhao man kai – rice steamed in chicken stock with garlic, with boiled chicken, chicken stock, and a spicy dipping sauce. It is usually served with a bowl of radish soup, or nam kaeng hua chai thao.\nKhao mu daeng – slices of Thai-style Chinese char siu are served with rice, sliced cucumber, and a thickened gravy. This often comes with a bowl of broth and a few raw scallions. Thick, black soy sauce with sliced chilies is used as a condiment.\nKhao na pet – rice served with slices of red-roast duck, sliced cucumber, and a thickened gravy.

A popular dish is stir-fried with eggs called Bai liang phat khai.\n\n## Desserts and sweets\n\n\n### Khong wan\n(Thai: ของหวาน; RTGS: khong wan) lit. 'sweet things').

One of the nine auspicious Thai desserts.\n\n### Ice cream\nIce cream was introduced to Thailand during the reign of King Rama V when the first ice cream machine was imported to Thailand. Ice cream in the second half of the 19th century was made of coconut water blended with ice. At first, ice could not be produced in Thailand. That led to importing ice from Singapore. Ice cream was then an upper-class treat, but over time ice cream became more widely available and the product was improved by replacing coconut water with coconut milk.\nThere were two types of ice cream in Thailand. First, ice cream in the palace was made of coconut juice with roasted tamarind on top. Second, ice cream for the public was coconut ice cream with the scent of the Nommaeo flower with a slight sweet taste. The ice cream \"tube\" was born during the reign of Rama VII. Its ingredients were contained inside a zinc tube which was shaken until it solidified, then skewered stick to serve as a handle. It was sold by mobile vendors using dry ice and salt to keep the ice cream cold. Eventually, ice cream was manufactured and sold in small cups.\nAccording to the Bangkok Post, aitim tat (Thai: ไอติมตัด; \"cut ice cream\"), was very popular 30 years ago (1986). It came in rectangular bars of various flavors, sliced into pieces by the vendor, who then inserted two wooden sticks into the pieces to use as holders. Aitim tat was made from milk, coconut milk, flour, sugar, and artificial flavour. The price was one or two baht, depending on the size.\nThe Pop Company in the 1970s set up the first ice-cream manufacturing plant in Thailand. The company used a duck logo, resulting it the nickname aitim tra pet (Thai: ไอติมตราเป็ด; \"duck brand ice cream\"). It was sold in front of Chaloemchai Theater. Its most popular offering was called \"banana split\", with three flavors of ice cream, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.\n\n## Beverages\nKhrueang duem (Thai: เครื่องดื่ม; lit. 'beverages')\n\nCha yen – Thai iced tea.\nKrating Daeng – an energy drink and the origin of Red Bull.\nNam maphrao – the juice of a young coconut, often served inside the coconut.\nNam matum – a refreshing and healthy drink made from the fruit of the Bael tree.\nNom yen  –  a drink made from sala syrup and hot milk.\nOliang – a sweet Thai black iced coffee.\nLao Khao – a traditional distilled spirits, since Ayutthaya period, which perhaps give origin to Okinawa liquor called Awamori.\nSatho – a traditional rice wine from the Isan region.\nNam bai bua bok – A refreshing and healthy drink is made from the green leaf of the Centella asiatica.\nOther alcoholic beverages from Thailand include Hong Thong, Phraya, Regency, Mekhong and Sang Som. Several brands of beer are brewed in Thailand; the two most prominent brands are Singha and Chang.\n\n## Insects\nEdible insects, whole or in chili paste and as ingredients in fortified products, are common in Thailand. Some claim that Thailand is the world leader in edible insects. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that there are about 20,000 cricket farms alone in 53 of Thailand's 76 provinces.\nA wide range of insects are eaten in Thailand, especially in Isan and in the north. Many markets in Thailand sell deep-fried grasshoppers, crickets (ching-rit), bee larvae, silkworm (non mai), ant eggs (khai mot) and termites. The culinary creativity even extends to naming: one tasty larva, which is also known under the name \"bamboo worm\" (non mai phai, Omphisa fuscidentalis), is colloquially called \"express train\" (rot duan) due to its appearance.\nMost insects reportedly taste fairly bland when deep-fried. In contrast to the bland taste of most of these insects, the maeng da or maelong da na (Lethocerus indicus) has been described as having a very penetrating taste, similar to that of a very ripe gorgonzola cheese. This giant water bug is famously used in a chili dip called nam phrik maeng da. Ant eggs and silkworms are eaten boiled in a soup in Isan, or used in egg dishes in northern Thailand.\n\n## Street food, food courts, and market food\nThe street food culture of much of Southeast Asia was introduced by Chinese immigrants during the late 19th century. As a result, many Thai street foods are derived from or heavily influenced by Chinese cuisine. Street food was commonly sold by the ethnic Chinese population of Thailand and did not become popular among native Thai people until the early 1960s, when the rapid urban population growth stimulated the street food culture, and by the 1970s, it had \"displaced home-cooking.\"\nThe quality and choice of street food in Thailand is world-renowned. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best street food cities in the world, and even called the street food capital of the world. The website VirtualTourist says: \"Few places in the world, if any, are as synonymous with street food as Thailand. For the variety of locations and abundance of options, we selected Bangkok, Thailand, as our number one spot for street food. Bangkok is notable for both its variety of offerings and the city's abundance of street hawkers.\"\nThere is scarcely a Thai dish that is not sold by a street vendor or at a market somewhere in Thailand. Some specialize in only one or two dishes; others offer a complete menu that rival that of restaurants. Some sell only pre-cooked foods, while others make food to order. Foods that are made to order tend to be dishes that can be quickly prepared: quick stir fries with rice, such as phat kaphrao (spicy basil-fried minced pork, chicken, or seafood) or phat khana (stir fried gailan) and quick curries such as pladuk phat phet (catfish fried with red curry paste).\nNoodles are a popular street food item as they are mainly eaten as a single dish. Chinese-style noodle soups, fried noodles, and fermented Thai rice noodles (khanom chin), served with a choice of different Thai curries, are popular. Nearly everywhere in Thailand, you will see som tam (green papaya salad) and sticky rice sold at stalls and roadside shops. This is popularly eaten together with grilled chicken, but if the shop does not sell any themselves, someone else nearby will. In most cities and towns there will be stalls selling sweet roti, a thin, flat fried dough envelope, with fillings such as banana, egg, and chocolate. The roti is similar to the Malay roti canai and Singaporean roti prata, and the stalls are often operated by Thai Muslims. Sweets snacks, collectively called khanom, such as tako (coconut cream jelly), khanom man (coconut cassava cake), and khanom wun (flavored jellies), can be seen displayed on large trays in glass covered push-carts. Other sweets, such as khanom bueang and khanom krok (somewhat similar to Dutch poffertjes), are made to order.\nIn the evenings, mobile street stalls, often only a scooter with a side car, drive by and temporarily set up shop outside bars in Thailand, selling kap klaem (\"drinking food\"). Popular kap klaem dishes sold by mobile vendors are grilled items such as sun-dried squid, meats on skewers, or grilled sour sausages, and deep-fried snacks such as fried insects or fried sausages. Peeled and sliced fruits are also sold from street carts, laid out on a bed of crushed ice to preserve their freshness. Salapao, steamed buns filled with meat or sweet beans and the Thai version of the Chinese steamed baozi, are also commonly sold by mobile vendors.\nFood markets in Thailand, large open air halls with permanent stalls, tend to operate as a collection of street stalls, each vendor with their own set of tables and providing (limited) service, although some resemble the regular food courts at shopping malls and large supermarkets, with service counters and the communal use of tables. Food courts and food markets offer many of the same foods as street stalls, both pre-cooked as well as made to order. Night food markets, in the form of a collection of street stalls and mobile vendors, spring up in parking lots, along busy streets, and at temple fairs and local festivals in the evenings, when the temperatures are more agreeable and people have finished work.\nThe dishes sold at wet markets in Thailand tend to be offered pre-cooked. Many people go there, and also to street vendors, to buy food for at work, or to take back home. It is a common sight to see Thais carrying whole communal meals consisting of several dishes, cooked rice, sweets, and fruit, all neatly packaged in plastic bags and foam food containers, to be shared with colleagues at work or at home with friends and family. Due to the fact that many dishes are similar to those that people would cook at home, it is a good place to find regional, and seasonal, foods.\n\n## Vegetarianism in Thailand\nAlthough the Vegetarian Festival is celebrated each year by a portion of Thailand's population, and many restaurants in Thailand will offer vegetarian food during this festival period, pure vegetarian food is usually difficult to find in normal restaurants and eateries in Thailand. All traditionally made Thai curries, for instance, contain shrimp paste, and fish sauce is used as salt in many Thai dishes. At shops and restaurants that specifically cater to vegetarians, substitutes for these ingredients are used. Meat dishes are also commonly part of the alms offered to Buddhist monks in Thailand, as vegetarianism is not considered obligatory in Theravada Buddhism, but having an animal killed specifically to feed Buddhist monks is prohibited.\n\nIn most towns and cities, traditional Buddhist vegetarian fare, without any meat or seafood products of any kind and also excluding certain strong tasting vegetables and spices, is sold at specialized vegetarian restaurants which can be recognized by a yellow sign with in Thai script the word che (Thai: เจ) or ahan che (Thai: อาหารเจ) written on it in red. These restaurants serve what can be regarded as vegan food. Many Indian restaurants of the sizable Thai-Indian community will also have vegetarian dishes on offer, due to the fact that vegetarianism is held as an ideal by many followers of the Hindu faith. Indian vegetarian cuisine can incorporate dairy products and honey. Due to the increased demand for vegetarian food from foreign tourists, many hotels, guesthouses and restaurants that cater to them will now also have vegetarian versions of Thai dishes on their menu. Pescatarians would have very few problems with Thai cuisine due to the abundance of Thai dishes which only contain fish and seafood as their source of animal protein.\n\n## Culinary diplomacy\nThai cuisine only became well-known worldwide from the 1960s on, when Thailand became a destination for international tourism and US troops arrived in large numbers during the Vietnam War. The number of Thai restaurants went up from four in the 1970s London to between two and three hundred in less than 25 years. The earliest attested Thai restaurant in the United States, \"Chada Thai\", opened its doors in 1959 in Denver, Colorado. It was run by the former newspaper publisher Lai-iad (Lily) Chittivej. The oldest Thai restaurant in London, \"The Bangkok Restaurant\", was opened in 1967 by Mr and Mrs Bunnag, a former Thai diplomat and his wife, in South Kensington.\nThe global popularity of Thai cuisine is seen as an important factor in promoting tourism, and also increased exports of Thailand's agricultural sector. From the 2000s, it was developed as a deliberate gastrodiplomacy. The Thaksin administration (2001–2006) launched the \"Kitchen of the World\" campaign early in its tenure to promote Thai cuisine internationally, with a yearly budget of 500 million baht. It provided loans and training for restaurateurs seeking to establish Thai restaurants overseas; established the \"Thai Select\" certification program which encouraged the use of ingredients imported from Thailand; and promoted integration between Thai investors, Thai Airways, and the Tourism Authority of Thailand with Thai restaurants overseas.\nThe \"Global Thai\" program, launched in 2002, was a government-led culinary diplomacy initiative. It aimed to boost the number of Thai restaurants worldwide to 8,000 by 2003 from about 5,500 previously. By 2011, that number had swelled to more than 10,000 Thai restaurants worldwide.\nThe program was explained in Thailand: Kitchen of the World, an e-book published to promote the program. The point of the e-book: \"In the view of the Export Promotion Department, Thai restaurants have a good business potential that can be developed to maintain a high level of international recognition. To achieve that goal, the department is carrying out a public relations campaign to build up a good image of the country through Thai restaurants worldwide.\"\nThe Department of Export Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Commerce offers potential restaurateurs plans for three different \"master restaurant\" types—from fast food to elegant—which investors can choose as a prefabricated restaurant plan. Concomitantly, the Export-Import Bank of Thailand offered loans to Thai nationals aiming to open restaurants abroad, and the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Bank of Thailand set up an infrastructure for loans of up to US$3 million for overseas food industry initiatives, including Thai restaurants.\nOne survey conducted in 2003 by the Kellogg School of Management and Sasin Institute showed that Thai cuisine ranked fourth when people were asked to name an ethnic cuisine, after Italian, French, and Chinese cuisine. When asked \"what is your favourite cuisine?\", Thailand's cuisine came in at sixth place, behind the three aforementioned cuisines, and Indian and Japanese cuisine.\nIn June 2009, the Tourism Authority of Thailand organised a conference to discuss these matters at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Centre in Bangkok. TAT Governor Seree Wangpaichitr said, \"This conference was long overdue. The promotion of Thai cuisine is one of our major niche-market targets. Our figures show that visitors spent 38.8 billion baht on eating and drinking last year, up 16% over 1997.\"\nIn the list of the \"World's 50 most delicious foods\", compiled by CNN in 2011, som tam stands at place 46, nam tok mu at 19, tom yam kung at 8, and massaman curry stands on first place as most delicious food in the world. In a reader's poll held a few months later by CNN, Nam tok mu came in at 36, Thai fried rice at 24, green curry at 19, massaman curry at 10, and Thai som tam, pad thai, and tom yam kung at six, five, and four.\nIn 2012, the British Restaurant Magazine included Nahm Bangkok of chef David Thompson in its yearly list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants.\n\n## Awards\nThai chefs of the Thailand Culinary Academy took second place in the Gourmet Team Challenge (Practical) of the FHC China International Culinary Arts Competition 14 in Shanghai, China on 14–16 November 2012. They won the IKA Culinary Olympic 2012 competition held in Erfurt, Germany between 5–10 October 2012, where they received four gold and one silver medal.\nIn 2011, the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef in the Northwestern United States, was presented to Andy Ricker of restaurant \"Pok Pok\" in Portland, Oregon, and for Best Chef in the Southwestern United States to Saipin Chutima of restaurant \"Lotus of Siam\" in Winchester, Nevada.\n\n### Michelin stars\nThree restaurants that specialize in Thai cuisine, but are owned by non-Thai chefs, have received Michelin stars:\n\n2002 – 2011 \"Nahm\" in London, run by chef David Thompson\n2009 – \"Kiin Kiin\" in Copenhagen, run by chef Henrik Yde-Andersen and Lertchai Treetawatchaiwong\n2015 – \"Pok Pok NY\" in New York City, run by chef Andy Ricker\n\n## Culinary tours and cooking courses\nCulinary tours of Thailand have gained popularity in recent years. Alongside other forms of tourism in Thailand, food tours have carved a niche for themselves. Many companies offer culinary and cooking tours of Thailand and many tourists visiting Thailand attend cooking courses offered by hotels, guesthouses and cooking schools.\n\n## Governmental interventions\nThe Thai government believes that a substandard Thai restaurant meal served abroad \"...sabotages the country's reputation.\" To ensure the quality of Thai food abroad, the government has over the years initiated a series of programs designed to create universal standards for Thai food.\nIn 2003 the Ministry of Finance sent officials to the US to award certificates to deserving restaurants. On their return the project was abandoned.\nSoon thereafter, the Ministry of Labor created Krua Thai Su Krua Lok ('Thai kitchen goes global'). Its centerpiece was a 10-day Thai cooking course for those who wanted to prepare Thai food overseas. The effort was short-lived.\nAfter some officials had a bad Thai meal abroad, in 2013 the Yingluck administration had the idea of standardising Thai food everywhere. The National Food Institute (NFI) came up with a program called Rod Thai Tae ('authentic Thai taste'). A parallel effort was called the \"Thai Delicious\" project.\n\n### Thai Delicious project\nThailand's National Innovation Agency (NIA), a public organization under the Thai Ministry of Science and Technology, spearheaded a 30 million baht (US$1 million), effort by the government to:\n\nDevelop Thai recipes with \"authentic taste\" and establish them as standard recipes\nDevelop biosensor equipment to analyze and evaluate taste and flavors\nDevelop institutional food (ready-to-cook products) based on the standardized recipes to meet the demand for Thai food in foreign countries\nProvide a food certification service as well as training for local and foreign chefs working in Thai restaurants worldwide\nThe agency has posted 11 \"authentic\" recipes for tom yam kung (nam sai), tom yam kung (nam khon), pad thai, Massaman curry, kaeng khiao wan (green curry), kaeng lueang (southern Thai sour curry), golek chicken sauce, khao soi, sai ua (northern Thai sausage), nam phrik num (green pepper chili paste), and nam phrik ong (northern Thai chili paste). These recipes were featured at a gala dinner promoting \"Authentic Thai Food for the World\", held at the Plaza Athénée Hotel Bangkok on 24 August 2016 at which Thailand's Minister of Industry was the honored guest. By 2020, Thai Delicious plans to post over 300 Thai food recipes.\nTo determine authenticity, Thai researchers developed the \"e-delicious machine\", described as \"...an intelligent robot that measures smell and taste in food ingredients through sensor technology in order to measure taste like a food critic.\" The machine evaluates food by measuring its conductivity at different voltages. Readings from 10 sensors are combined to produce a chemical signature. Because the machine cannot judge taste, the food is compared with a standard derived from a database of popular preferences for each dish. For tom yam, the spicy soup flavored with Kaffir lime leaves and coriander, researchers posted notices at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, requesting 120 tasters. The tasters—students, university staff, and area workers—were paid a few baht for their opinions. They were served 10 differently prepared soups and rated each one. The winning soup was declared the standard, and its chemical characteristics were programmed into the machine. When testing food, the machine returns a numerical score from one to 100. A score lower than 80 is deemed \"not up to standard\". The machine cost about US$100,000 to develop. Restaurants that follow officially sanctioned recipes can affix a \"Thai Delicious\" logo to their menus. Each machine sold for 200,000 baht. This project was shelved.\nThe Thai Delicious project has been criticized, the main rationale being that \"Standardisation is the enemy of Thai food.\" Some observers think, however, that the quality of Thai food, at least in the US, is declining with its increased popularity, a state of affairs that Thai Delicious aims to fix.\nIn August 2018, Thailand's Ministry of Commerce kicked off a project called \"Thai Select\". It issues certificates in three grades to domestic Thai restaurants: gold (five stars); red (four stars); and orange (three stars). The goal is to enable tourists to Thailand to choose a worthy restaurant.\nCulture Minister Vira Rojpojchanarat announced in 2018 that between 2020 and 2024, his ministry will investigate ways to preserve authentic Thai cuisine from the increasing influence of foreign dishes. \"Unique in its preparation with recipes handed down for generations, Thai culinary art needs better protection against foreign influences which are now changing the look and taste of certain local dishes,\" he warned. The plan will conform to the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, initiated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The 2003 convention intends to protect the \"uses, representations, expressions, knowledge and techniques that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals, recognised as an integral part of their cultural heritage\".\n\n### Salt reduction efforts\nOn average, Thai people consume 4,300 mg of sodium per day, twice the WHO's recommended maximum. Thai street food is one of the top three contributors to high salt intake. The Public Health Ministry has embarked on a program to reduce the population's salt consumption by 30 percent.\n\n## See also\nList of Thai dishes (includes names in Thai script)\nList of Thai ingredients (includes names in Thai script)\nList of Thai khanom\nList of Thai restaurants\nList of Thai desserts and snacks\nTourism in Thailand\nCulture of Thailand\nThai curry\nThai salads\nFilipino cuisine\nIndian cuisine\nIndonesian cuisine\nKhmer royal cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nDavid Thompson, Classic Thai Cuisine, 145 pages, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1993, ISBN 0-89815-563-0\nVatcharin Bhumichitr, The Essential Thai Cookbook, 192 pages, New York: Clarkson N.

    "text": "# Thalassery cuisine\n\nThalassery cuisine refers to the distinct cuisine from Thalassery city of northern Kerala, which has incorporated Indian, Persian, Arabian and European styles of cooking as a result of its long history as a maritime trading post.\nThalassery is known for its Thalassery biryani (in local dialect, biri-yaa-ni). Unlike other biryani dishes, Thalassery biryani is made using kaima (also known as jeerakasala), an Indian aromatic rice, instead of the usual basmati rice.\nInfluences of Mughal culture are evident.\nThalassery also occupies a special place in the modern history of Kerala as the pioneer of its bakery industry, since the first bakery was started by Mambally Bapu in 1880 and Western-style cakes were introduced in 1883.\n\n## Malabar cuisine\nThere are broadly two classes of non-vegetarian cuisine in Kerala: Malabar cuisine, which is from North Kerala, and Syrian-Christian cuisine which is from the South (Travancore and Kochi regions).\nThe two are clearly distinct: the former has Mughlai-Arab, Portuguese, British, Dutch, and French influences and the latter includes a mix of Kerala traditional dishes rich in coconut, as well as various recipes of Syrian, Jewish, Dutch, Portuguese and British origin.\nMost dishes of Malabar cuisine, including Thalassery biryani, involve frying in ghee.\nThere are sweet and spicy variants and they are predominantly non-vegetarian. Some typical examples include ari pathiri, chatti pathiri, kallummakaya (mussels) fry, arikkadukka (stuffed fried mussels) and biryanis with chicken, mutton, prawns, fish and egg, as well as sweeteners such as aleesa and Kadalapparippu ada. The sweeteners are mostly used as snacks to be consumed in the afternoon or early evening.\nBiryani was introduced into the region due to Islamic influence and the recipe gradually evolved into Thalassery biryani. Biryani is traditionally seen only as an occasional serving and not as staple food.\n\n## Thalassery faloodha\nThalassery faloodha is a regional variant of the Persian dessert faloodeh. This is a cocktail of fruit salad, dry fruits such as raisins, pistachios, cashews, almonds (badam), rose milk, and vanilla ice cream.\n\n## Green mussel dishes\nThe Asian green mussel (Perna viridis) is favored in Thalassery dishes. The mussel is called Kallu-mma-kaya (fruit on the stone) or kadukka. They grow on rocky surfaces in the Arabian Sea.\nOther dishes include kallummakaya porichathu (fried mussel), arikkadukka (stuffed-in-shell mussel, steamed and fried), kallumakkaya ularthiyath (mussel stir-fry), kallumakkaya varattiyathu (mussel pickles). Elambakka (clams) are also popular. \n\nThe green mussels' popularity led farmers to employ aquaculture in local rivers to increase supplies. Thalassery natives are known for their generous hospitality towards guests.\n\n## Thalassery snacks\nAnother Thalassery dish is kozhi-kkalu, made with sliced tapioca. Pappadam-pazham kuzhakkal and aval um poriyum kuzhakkal are other popular dishes.\nMuttamala, taripola, pazham nirachatu (fried banana filled with grated coconut sugar or jaggery), unnakaya, jaayi pola, chatti pathiri and ari pathiri are other local dishes.\nPorridges such as mutaari kachiyatu (ragi porridge), are popular.\nMuttamala and muttasirka are traditional sweets made using egg, where muttamala is yellow noodle-like made of egg-yolk and muttasirka is white-colored, made of egg whites. Typically, muttamala is spread over pieces of muttasirka, and they are further adorned with cherries.\nUnnakkai (ഉന്നക്കായ്‌) also known as unnakaya, unnakka, kaai ada, and kaai porichathu, is a spindle-shaped sweet dessert made of plantains. It is a famous snack often served at weddings, Iftar parties and other festivities.\nIt is prepared by stuffing plantain with flavored coconut (and optionally with egg) and fried in ghee.\nChatti pathiri is similar to lasagne where layers of spiced (masala) beef or chicken mixture are placed between layers of egg-dipped pancakes and baked in oven. It is especially served in Malabar Muslim weddings and reception parties.\n\n## Thalassery biryani\nThalassery biryani is a rice-based dish blended with spices and chicken. As it is the only biryani recipe in Kerala cuisine, it can also be called Kerala biryani. Thalassery biryani is the only type of biryani in Kerala using Kaima rice.\nOther types of biriyani with different ingredients that use the same rice and preparation methods are kannur biriyani, malappuram biriyani, ponnani biriyani, kochi kayees biriyani, calicut biriyani, kochi mint biriyani and alapuzha biriyani.\nThe main difference between Thalassery biryani and other biryanis is that Thalassery biryani uses only khaima/jeerakasala rice—a short-grain, thin rice which is also called biryani rice in Kerala. The dish does not use basmati rice.\nBiryani is an exotic dish of Mughal origin, but this variant is an indigenous recipe of Malabar. It is a symbol of the cultural amalgamation of Mughal and Malabari cuisines. The Mughals brought the cuisine of biryani from Samarkand, and later variations of biryani developed in different parts of India.\nThalassery biryani may have come to the region because of the influence of the Muslim rulers of Mysore and Arkot.\nThalassery biryani is a cultural embodiment and is reminiscent of foreign influences in Malabar; it is a reminder of the Mughal-Arab cultural influence in North Kerala due to the trade that lasted for many centuries before the 1900s and the emigration to the Middle East of locals from the 1970s onwards. The Thalassery]] sea port was an export trade centre for spices where a convergence of European, Arab and Malabar cultures occurred.\n\n### Etymology\nThe name \"Thalassery biryani\" (Malayalam: തലശ്ശേരി ബിരിയാണി, Tamil: தலச்சேரி பிரியாணி,  Hindi: त लश्शेरि बिरयानी, Arabic: برياني تلشیری) originates from Thalassery, a town in the coastal Malabar region in North Kerala, India.  The word \"biryani\" is derived from the Persian word biryān (n) (بریان) which means \"fried\" or \"roasted\". Biryani was believed to have been invented in the kitchens of the Mughal Emperors; Thalassery biryani is one of many ways of preparing biryani dishes. In the local dialect-Malayalam, there is a small variation in pronunciation. It is called \"biri-yaa-ni\" instead of \"bir-yani\".\n\n### Historical and cultural influences\nThalassery biryani is a strong indication of Islamic cultural influence in the region. The dish is traditional Mappila (Malabar Muslims) or Malabar cuisine. Ancient written records, except in a few treatises by historians, citing the origin of Mappilas are rare.\nThe stories about the conversion of the last Chera Emperor Cheraman Perumal (Rama Varma Kulasekhara Perumal) to Islam from Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur) by Malik Deenar and the subsequent conversion of Perumal's sister and nephew residing in Dharmadam (a village located north of Thalassery) are generally believed to be the origin of Islam in North Malabar.\nPerumal is believed to have left Kerala from an erstwhile feudal province in the region named Poyanad (Poya Nadu, \"The province from whence he left\") which lies in between the Thalassery and Kannur taluks (governed by local chieftains named Randuthara Achanmar before 1947).\nPerumal's nephew Mahabali, is believed to be the first Ali Raja of the Arakkal kingdom (the Sultanate of Lakshadweep and Cannanore), the sole Muslim kingdom of Kerala. The Arakkal kingdom controlled Dharmadam until the formation of Kerala state on 1 November 1956.\nThe legend shows that these incidents had a significant impact in the introduction of Islamic culture to Thalassery.\nIn the ancient times, Thalassery—an erstwhile seaport in North Malabar—was geographically in the convergence point of three regional provinces, Chirakkal, Kottayam and Kadathanad. It was also the end point of the \"Perya pass\" coming from the eastern hilly areas of Coorg and Wayanad making it an important trade center of spices in Malabar.\nArab traders, Arkot rulers and the invasion of Sultanate of Mysore were other important factors which introduced and developed various Islamic culture in the region.\nDuring the Muslim holy month of Ramzan, Malabar dishes are made in abundant varieties. The Muslim community of Malabar differs culturally; the lifestyle of the trader communities near the coastal towns differs from that of the farming communities in the inland and hilly areas.\nMalabar cuisine varies throughout the region. In the modern era as communication improved exponentially, the differences of culture between coastal and hilly area became inconspicuous resulting in the amalgamation of food culture within the community in Malabar .\nThe Mughlai cuisine had a significant influence upon Malabar recipes. Mughali recipes including biryani, kebab and naan spread throughout India. The ingredients included rice, maida, wheat and there was extensive use of ghee (clarified butter) and oils for preparation. Sweet delicacies were made from jaggery (unrefined sugar).\nMost of these dishes are non-vegetarian; chicken, mutton, lamb and beef are used but pork is not consumed due to religious regulations. Dishes range from mild to extremely spicy, and the dishes have distinct aromas.\nIn Islamic food culture non-vegetarian dishes must be halal-compliant, as required for Muslims by religious directive. Malabar Mappila dishes are preferred by some societies to be compliant with the halal method of food processing.\n\n### Differences from other biryani\nThalassery biryani uses a unique, fragrant, small-grained, thin rice variety named kaima  or jeerakasala. This rice, even though small in size, is different from the common small rice used in many Indian rice dishes.\nKaima/jeerakasala is not round, unlike other common smaller variants, and its fragrance is another distinct feature.  Other kinds of rice that could be used are jeera rice, jeerakasemba or small Bangladeshi biryani rice.\nThe rice is white, short (small) grained, thin (not plump), but it is the aroma of these rice varieties which make then distinctive. \nThe recipes and cuisine of Thalassery biryani have clear differences from other biryani variants.\nKaima/jeerakasala rice does not need pre-soaking, water is only used to clean it. After adequate boiling no water should remain in the cooking dish as it should have been evaporated completely. This is a major difference from other rice preparation, in which water has to be drained off after cooking.\nGhee rice is blended with masala using the dum process (a method of cooking by sealing a lid tightly and placing hot charcoal on it). The biryani masala and ghee rice are arranged in layers inside the dish. Meat is cooked with masala on slow fire; it is layered with rice and the lid of the container is sealed with maida dough or a loin cloth. Hot coal or charcoal is placed then above the lid.\nThalassery biryani is a Pakki biryani. There are two types of biryani, \"Pakki\" and \"Kacchi\". In Pakki style, the ghee rice is added to the fully cooked chicken-masala mix and then cooked by the dum process, whereas in Kacchi style the ghee rice is added to the half-cooked chicken and then cooked till it is fully cooked or the dum process is used.\nSpecially dressed chicken is poured into the masala dish. The chicken is slowly cooked in the masala, and gets blended well with the juices of masala and spices.\nThe Thalassery biryani recipe has additional distinct features; unlike other biryanis it is not oily because of the dum process used for preparation. A unique blend of spices is added and the kaima rice also adds a unique flavour. No oil is used to make the chicken, which is added raw into the masala mix.\n\n### Ingredients\nFor the recipe, see  Thalassery Biryani at the Wikibooks Cookbook subproject\n\nKhaima (jeerakasala) rice\nChicken\nOnion\nGinger\nGarlic\nGreen chilli\nLime juice\nShallot\nCoriander leaves\nMint leaves\nTomato\nGhee\nHydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati)\nCoconut oil\nEdible rose water\nCurd or yoghurt\nTable salt\nSpices: Garam masala powder, Persian cumin (caraway), mace, turmeric powder, red chili powder, black pepper powder, crushed curry leaves (optional) cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, Malabar leaf (Indian bay leaf), Indian white poppy seed (kaskas) and for garnishing and texture saffron soaked in milk, pinch of artificial food colour, yellow or orange; and fried (coconut oil) mix of onion, cashew nuts and kismis (sultana raisins), star anise (optional).\n\n### Accompaniments\nCommon side dishes served with Thalassery biryani are coconut-mint chammandi (biryani chutney), South Asian pickle and thairu. After the meal, hot lime-black tea (known among the Muslim community as sulaimani) is served; this adds a special taste after the main course and is an aid to digestion.  Lime tea is a common \"afters\" in the Malabar region, especially with a rice-based main course.\nFried Indian anchovy or smelt can be served as a starter if required and this is garnished with chopped onion, curry leaves and lime juice squeezed over it. Fried chicken in smaller pieces is also seen in some fiestas as accompaniments or as starters.\nDaahashamani water, a medicated herbal water, is preferred to be used when drinking water with biryani. Daahashamani is an ayurvedic medicine and natural thirst reliever and digestive aid prepared by mixing dry ginger, cardamom, cloves, coriander seeds, mimosa catechu, sapanwood, vetiver, puncturevine and sandal wood, it is usually available in local markets.\n\n### Popularity\nThalassery biryani is popular and is often served in Malabar in weddings and other celebrations and parties, and is an unavoidable dish for the Muslim community.\nEven though sadya is the traditional cuisine for Hindu weddings in the region, some Hindus and Christians often serve biryani, mainly because it is easier to prepare than other main course dishes and is a complete food that avoids the extra effort of making curry.\n\n### Nutrition\nThalassery biryani is rich in nutrients as it is a rice-spice dish. It is high in proteins and carbohydrates, and is also a source of minerals and vitamins. Nutritional value (according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture) of the spices is mentioned in the notes.\nThe dish contains unsaturated and saturated fats; the amount of saturated fat can be reduced by adjusting the quantities of hydrogenated vegetable oil (vanaspati) and ghee.\n\n### In fiction\nThe Malayalam movie Ustad Hotel is based on the preparation of Malabar biryani. The film is about a restaurant that specialises in Malabar cuisines made without adulteration and based on traditional recipes. The film shows customers choosing the restaurant for its authentic dishes.\n\nThe fictional restaurant depicted in the film is a prominent destination for food lovers as the cuisine is based on genuine Malabar cuisine. The restaurant serves their flagship dish—Thalassery biryani—to all customers who come there for the first time, so admiring the dish that whenever they come back to the city they choose this restaurant and order it again.\n\n## See also\nCuisine of Kerala\nSouth Indian cuisine\nList of rice dishes\n\n## Notes and references\n\n\n### Notes\nName of ingredients and their corresponding nutritional value (Link to this is given as highlighted superscript).

Western imports and fusion dishes, such as fried yak and chips, are also popular. Nevertheless, many small restaurants serving traditional Tibetan dishes persist in both cities and the countryside.\n\n## Food culture\n\n\n### Cookware\nTibetans use pots, pans, cans, steamer pots and boxes made from various materials. Tibetan women carry large wooden containers, which can hold up to 25 liters, to fetch water once a day. Returning to the house, they pour the water into built-in copper cans that hold more than 100 liters. Cooking pots made from iron or brass are used on the stove. Traditionally, pans were used rarely, but are becoming increasingly popular. Wooden boxes are used to store tsampa, butter and cheese. Tibetans use elaborately woven baskets with matching lids to store dried fruits, rice and sugar. When travelling, they use the baskets to store dried meat and cheese. In Southern Tibet, mortars are indispensable for crushing chilis.\n\n### Dinnerware\nTibetan dinnerware is traditionally made from wood, but sometimes lacquered clay is used. According to local tradition, this handicraft was passed down for generations. Those who could afford to do so purchased high-quality porcelain bowls from elsewhere. In more modern times, other types of porcelain from China or elsewhere are used. Spoons are indispensable for most dishes. Poor people and children wore them around their necks to allow constant and easy access. Knives are sometimes used to eat fruits. Tibetans also use small soup bowls, while the rich used bowls of gold and silver.\n\n## Tea\nTeacups are sometimes carried in the abdominal fold of the Chuba, a traditional costume. Wooden teacups made from dzabija wood are considered especially fine. They have a smooth surface, an impressive grain pattern and are made with a balanced form, which relates to the composition of the raw wood. They are comfortable to hold. The cups are costly and most cannot afford them. Lavish teacups often have a layer of silver inside, which is intended to make them easier to clean. The nobility and high lamas used stands and tops that were intricately ornamented with mythological motifs. The tops are used to preserve the scent of the tea. The most precious cups shipped from other provinces are made from white jade. They have no handles. The best teacups are made from metal or silver, which are used only for guests and on festival days. The silversmiths from Derge are known for their exquisite tea sets. Teapots are typically made from wood or clay, while the better ones are made from lavishly ornamented metals such as copper or brass.\nThe Dongmo is a tea-mixing cylinder used for making Tibetan butter tea. It usually has a volume of around 4 litres and is made from wood ornamented with brass. A whisk is placed in a hole on the top of the Dongmo and, with 15-20 vertical movements, the butter tea emulsifies.\n\n### Monastic kitchens\nTibetan monks are self-sufficient. They cook for themselves and raise money by praying for farmers and nomads or by performing rituals for the well-being of families. In monastery kitchens, large pots are used to make soups. During breaks in religious studies, the monks are served tea and soup. Novice monks walk through the rows and pour tea from richly decorated teapots.\n\n## Etiquette\nFriendliness, hospitality, generosity and selflessness, derived from the principles of Tibetan Buddhism, are the basis of local etiquette. Behaviour which is egocentric or egoistic is regarded as inappropriate, and helping/supporting others is idealized. Combined with their belief in Karma - that everything that happens in life has a source in actions committed in the past - they easily process a loss, sickness or great misfortune as they believe this relieves them from the effects of past actions.\nGuests witness this attitude. Upon arriving, a guest receives a Khata - a white silk scarf - that symbolizes joy for the visit and reverence for the guest. After entering, a guest's comfort and well-being is cared for in every way, including cooking. The guest may be offered tea, but instead of accepting immediately, the guest is culturally expected to politely decline - the guest too has to be exemplary. Without hesitating, the host (customarily the woman of the house) immediately serves the tea. The host pours and hands over the cup with both hands as a sign of respect. In the common protocol, the guest only takes a small sip before putting the cup down. The host will fill up the cup and ask the guest to drink again. This is repeated two more times before the guest empties the cup slowly. If the guest leaves the cup filled without drinking, this is regarded as a signal of contentment. Without asking, the cup will be taken away and the guest will often be offered Chang (barley beer). At the table, expectations are that individuals sit cross-legged, and it is considered impolite to stretch one's legs. In addition, one should never pass over body parts of another. Pastries may be served with tea. Offered a meal, the guest may politely refuse at first. Upon subsequent offering, the host may find out what the guest wants.\nThe goal of every host is to create a relaxed atmosphere and to give joy and pleasure.\n\n## Dishes\nOther Tibetan foods include:\n\nSha Phaley - bread stuffed with seasoned beef and cabbage, which is then fashioned into semi-circular or circular shapes and which, according to regional variations, is either deep fried or pan fried like pot stickers.\nBalep korkun - a central Tibetan flatbread cooked on a skillet rather than in an oven.\nTingmo (food) - a type of steamed bun, a heavier version of the Han Chinese baozi.\nThenthuk - a type of cold-weather soup made with noodles and various vegetables.\nShab Ta - Stir-fried meat tossed with celery, carrots and fresh green chili.\nGyurma (Juema) - a blood sausage with yak or sheep's blood and roasted barley flour or rice as filler\nSokham Bexe - fried dough, with butter and minced meat. It is said to be a favourite of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.\nDtowa Katsa - stewed tripe, with curry, fennel, monosodium glutamate and salt.\nLunggoi Katsa - stewed sheep's head, with curry, fennel, monosodium glutamate and salt.\nThue (cake) - a cheese cake pastry made with yak butter, brown sugar and water.\nMasan - a pastry, made with tsampa, dry cubic or curd cheese, yak butter, brown sugar and water.\nShogo Momo - a type of momo using mashed potato with dough, shaped into balls, with a minced meat filling, served with bread crumbs.\nSamkham Papleg - fried dough with yak butter or rapeseed oil.\n\n### Breads and fried dough foods\nPapza Mogu - dough balls with melted butter, brown sugar, and dry curd cheese.

Similar to Cantonese rice congee\nTsam-thuk - a type of gruel that uses yak or sheep stock and roasted barley flour as well as a variety of Tibetan cheeses.\nThukpa bhatuk - a common Tibetan noodle soup made with little bhasta noodles.\n\n### Sweet foods\nDay-see - a Tibetan sweet dish with rice cooked in unsalted butter and mixed with raisins, droma (gourd shaped root found), dates and nuts. This dish is usually served only on Losar (Tibetan New Year).\nKhapsey - Tibetan cookies or biscuits that are deep fried and made during celebrations such as the Tibetan New Year or weddings. Khapseys are fashioned into many different intricate shapes and textures. Some are sprinkled with powdered sugar while other shapes such as the donkey ear-shaped khapseys are used for decoration.\n\n### Desserts\nThue\n\n### Holiday dishes\nGuthuk - is traditionally eaten before Losar\nKhapse - pastries for Losar called nyapsha\nChangkol (food)\n\n## Cheeses, yogurt and butter\nTibetan cheeses, yogurt and butter are staples. Varieties include soft cheese curds resembling cottage cheese made from buttermilk called chura loenpa (or ser). Hard cheese is called chura kampo. Extra hard cheese, made from solidified yogurt, is called chhurpi, and is also found in Sikkim and Nepal. Another type of cheese called shosha or churul, with a flavor said to resemble Limburger, is also eaten. It is made from cream and the skin of milk.\n\n## Beverages\nMost Tibetans drink many cups of yak butter tea daily. Jasmine tea is also sometimes available.Brick tea is made by methods only distantly related to those employed in China or Sri Lanka (Ceylon). When the water boils, a great handful of the stuff is crumbled into it and allowed to stew for between five and ten minutes, until the whole infusion is so opaque that it looks almost black. At this stage a pinch of salt is added; the Tibetans always put salt, never sugar, in their tea. I have been told that they sometimes add a little soda, in order to give the beverage a pinkish tinge, but I never saw this done in Sikang. They very seldom, on the other hand, drink tea without butter in it. If you are at home, you empty the saucepan into a big wooden churn, straining the tea through a colander made of reed or horsehair. Then you drop a large lump of butter into it, and, after being vigorously stirred, this brew is transferred to a huge copper teapot and put on a brazier to keep it hot. When you are traveling, you do not normally take a churn with you, so everyone fills his wooden bowl with tea, scoops a piece of butter out of a basket, puts it in the bowl, stirs the mixture gently with his finger, and, finally, drinks the tea.\nButter tea is the national beverage. Although butter tea is the most popular tea, black tea is also fairly popular. Jasmine grows in Eastern Tibet. Most likely, Tibetans took absorbed jasmine tea from the Han Chinese cultural sphere. Spice tea is very popular among exiles who live in India and Nepal. It is almost unknown in Tibet. Most likely, it was adopted from Indian culture. Dara is the Tibetan word for buttermilk. It refers to the yogurt drink. It is also used for Indian Lassi.\n\n### Alcoholic beverages\nTraditionally, Tibetan Buddhism prohibited the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Beer mostly from barley, but rice, wheat, maize, oats and millet are also used in brewing. Chang is consumed through a thin bamboo straw.\nAlcoholic beverages include:\n\nBeer\nChang, a beer usually made from barley\nPinjopo, a rice wine\nAra, distilled or fermented grain alcohol\nTongba, a millet based alcoholic  beverage\n\n## Ingredients\nBarley has been a staple food since the fifth century AD. It is made into a flour product called tsampa which is still a staple. The flour is roasted and mixed with butter and butter tea to form a stiff dough that is eaten in small balls.\n\n## References\n\n\n### Citations\n\n\n### Sources\n\n\n## External links\n Media related to Cuisine of Tibet at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "# Tikka (food)\n\nTikka (pronounced [ʈɪkkaː]) is a dish consisting of pieces of meat or vegetarian alternatives whose origins are traced back to ancient Babylon. The term 'tikka' was given in the Mughal era. It is made by marinating the pieces in spices and yogurt, and cooking them in a tandoor. Tikka is popular throughout the Indian subcontinent and also in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Etymology\nTikka is a Chagatai word which has been commonly combined with the Hindi-Urdu word masala — itself derived from Arabic — with the combined word originating from British English. The Chagatai word tikka itself is a derivation of the Common Turkic word tikkü, which means \"piece\" or \"chunk\".\n\n## Origin\nThe precise origin of the dish is uncertain. Recipes for cooked meat enriched with spices and mixed within a sauce date back to 1700 BCE found on cuneiform tablets near Babylon, credited to the Sumerians. During the Mughal dynasty, the Mughals called \"boneless pieces of cooked meat\" Tikka.\nThere are different varieties of the dish, both meat inclusive and vegetarian. Generally, the dish is defined as \"a dish of small pieces of meat or vegetables marinated in a spice mixture\".\n\n## Preparation\nTikka consists of boneless pieces of meat or vegetarian alternatives such as paneer, which are marinated in spices and yogurt and subsequently strung through a skewer to be cooked. It is generally cooked in a tandoor and served dry.\n\n## Variations\n\n\n### Indian-subcontinent variations\nThe Indian variations of Tikka are the roots of the Western variations, including Chicken tikka and Paneer tikka, which are generally served dry.\n\n### Cross-cultural variations\nRegular chicken and paneer tikka have been combined with dishes from other cultures such as Mexican cuisine to create hybrid dishes such as Tikka Masala Burritos, which are served with either chicken or paneer as their main ingredient.\n\n## Popularity\n\n\n### In Britain\nA study was undertaken in the 1990s that revealed British interest in foreign food, with chicken tikka being a favourite filling in the British Rail sandwich.\n\n### In India\nA study of 670 foreign tourists at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, attempted to show the street food preferences of foreign tourists in the city, along with the reason for their selection. Of the 17 most preferred street foods, chicken tikka was the most favoured, with tourists preferring mildly flavoured foods that are hygienically prepared.\nDuring the cricket World Cup in 2018, restaurants in the host city served dishes named after cricket players using cricket terminology. For instance, paneer tikka was renamed Dhoni da Tikka after former Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and chicken tikka was renamed Virat's Straight Drive after Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli.\n\n## Preservation and quality\n\n\n### Paneer tikka\nPaneer tikka has a shelf-life of 1–2 days, which can be increased to 28 days using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) technology. Vacuum packaging is most effective as it is able to limit chemical changes during storage, increasing the refrigerated shelf-life of paneer tikka to 40 days.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Traditional rice of Sri Lanka\n\nRice in Sri Lanka has played an important role in the country's functioning and survival for centuries as a major staple food.  Rice continues to be a staple of traditional Sri Lankan cuisine today.\n\n## History\n\n\n### Early history\nSri Lankan people may have started cultivating rice as early as 800 B.C., according to documentary evidence.  Further evidence of early rice cultivation is the construction, since 390 B.C., of massive irrigation structures, reservoirs, and interconnected canals. From ancient times, rice cultivation was not only an economic activity, but a way of life for the people of Sri Lanka. Some varieties of rice have been passed down for generations, and are called traditional, indigenous, or heirloom.\nOnce renowned as the granary of the east, Sri Lanka offered more than 2000 indigenous rice varieties to the rest of the world. Rice cultivation in Sri Lanka was once considered sacred. The process remained sustainable due to the methods used for production, as well as the sanctity associated with the process of rice cultivation.\n\n### Rise of the new rices\nBy the 1980s, 90% of the farmland in Sri Lanka was being used to cultivate the \"semi-dwarf\" (newly improved) rice variety.\nCurrently, 95% of the rice produced in Sri Lanka are hybrid varieties.  These are harvested using non-organic fertilizer and pesticides which are needed to produce larger harvests with lower costs.\nHowever, traditional rice is gradually making a comeback.  This is due to increased global demand for organic food.\n\n## Traditional rices\n\n\n### Suwandel\nAs the translated name implies, this is a fragrant white rice with an exquisite aroma.\nIts milky taste makes Suwandel a common choice for festive occasions and ceremonies. Nutritionally, the rice consists of 90% carbohydrates, 7% crude protein, 0.7% crude fat, and 0.1% crude fiber. Suwandel is known to contain higher amounts of glutamic acid and vitamins than other, more common rice varieties.\nSuwandel is an heirloom rice variety, cultivated organically with traditional rain-fed methods in the southern lowlands of Sri Lanka. Because of this, cultivation takes longer than other varieties of rice.  It is usually 3 months before harvest.  Heirloom rice cultivation in Sri Lanka is a sacred process.\n\n### Kalu Heenati\nKalu Heenati is literally translated as \"dark, fine grain.\" It is a highly nutritious red rice that is considered to be good for daily consumption. It contains a lot of medicinal properties. It is very good for lactating mothers. It enhances sexual potential and physical strength.\n\n### Maa-Wee\nThis is a reddish-brown rice variety with a unique texture.  It is low in carbohydrates, and rich in protein and fiber. Ma-Wee is also proven to have a 25% to 30% lower glycemic index (GI) than other common rice varieties. It is 84.5% carbohydrates, 9.4% protein, 3.6% fat, and 1.1% fiber.\nMa-Wee rice is best when soaked prior to boiling. One traditional dish calls for the rice to be cooked with chopped spring onion and leeks, and served with bottle gourd sautéed in spices and coconut milk.\nMa-Wee was loved by the queens of Sri Lanka, who believed it helped them maintain a trim, shapely figure.\nMa-Wee is also revered for its historical importance in religious ceremonies. According to folklore, Ma-Wee has been placed in the caskets of sacred relics and the pinnacle (kotha) of dagabas.\n\n### Pachchaperumal\nThe word \"Pachchaperumal\" means \"The Lord Buddha’s color.\"  It is a wholesome red rice variety. When cooked, it takes on a deep, rich burgundy color. It is rich in nutrients and proteins, and is considered an excellent choice for an every day meal.  It is also said to be part of a good diet for people with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nPachchaperumal has long been considered a divine rice in traditional Sinhalese culture. Traditionally, it was often used in alms-giving.\n\n### Kuruluthuda\nA nutritious red rice variety rich in proteins and fiber, kuruluthuda has a unique, pleasant taste.\n\n### Water Lilly Rice\nThis is also known as Olu Sahal. Olu rice is one of the staple foods of the Hela diet.\n\n### Others\nOther varieties include Rathdel, Madathawalu, and Hetadha Wee.\n\n## Future\nRice has a sacred association among Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim populations alike. It is said that rice cooked with coconut milk was the first offering made to Buddha, and to this day the dish is a staple of Sri Lankan Buddhist culture during sacred festivals and important events.\n\n\n== References ==",

All the people eating this meal are expected to begin and end eating the meal together. A person cannot get up in middle of the meal, even though he has finished his meal. The start and end of meal is done by saying \"Govinda,\" the name of Lord Vishnu. A typical meal is served with the following (in sequence):\n\nDepending upon the occasion, individual taste, and money, each dish may be made from different ingredients.\n\n## Popular dishes in Udupi cuisine\n\n\n## Overview of Udupi cuisine\n\n\n## Udupi restaurants\nUdupi restaurants can be found all over India and many parts of the world. In the past, these restaurants were run by cooks and priests trained at Krishna matha in Udupi. With rising popularity, many others have entered this business. Most Udupi restaurants are family run, with ownership passing among kith and kin of the original owner. Udupi restaurants have undergone many changes in their menu in recent times, adapting to changing economic structure and social statuses in India. They have included vegetarian delicacies from other Indian cuisines.\nThe first major Udupi restaurant owner, K. Krishna Rao, began his career in food service as an attendant in ceremonies held by the Sri Krishna Temple, wherein food was served to gatherings of the temple staff and pilgrims. In 1922, he moved to Madras and joined Sharada Vilas Brahmins Hotel in George Town as a kitchen servant. He is the inventor of Masala Dosa. In 1925, his employer offered him one of his restaurants for ₹700 monthly. In 1939 Rao started his first hotel Udupi Sri Krishna Vilas, now called Old Woodlands. The other prominent chain of Udupi restaurant is the Dasaprakash group, founded by K. Seetharama Rao, who gave up a low-grade salaried position in Mangalore to join his brothers' snack food (tiffin) business in Mysore in 1921.\nIn 1923, a major flood devastated Udupi and caused mass migration of male workers and professionals to large cities. This led to a rising demand for low-cost public eating places. Several prominent Udupi restaurants such as Dasaprakash in Mysore, Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan and Mavalli Tiffin Rooms in Bangalore, were set up to cater to this demand. These restaurants were vegetarian, employed OBCs and upper-caste Hindus from Udupi, and initially, segregated seating spaces along caste lines.\nMumbai, Madras, Mysore, and Bangalore were important destinations for migrants from Udupi, and many restaurants were set up there. In Matunga in Mumbai, many Udupi restaurants such as Ramanayaks and Cafe Madras were established in the 1930s and 1940s. In the following decades, Udupi restaurants spread to all states and are now found in every corner of India. Eventually, it crossed national boundaries and reached cities with Indian diasporas around the world.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nCuisine of Karnataka\nBengali cuisine\nMavalli Tiffin Room\nNew Woodlands Hotel\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nYu.

    "text": "# Ugandan cuisine\n\nUgandan cuisine consists of traditional and modern cooking styles, practices, foods and dishes in Uganda, with English, Arab, and Asian (especially Indian) influences.\nMany dishes include various vegetables, potatoes, yams, bananas and other tropical fruits.\nChicken, pork, fish (usually fresh, but there is also a dried variety, reconstituted for stewing), beef and goat are all commonly eaten, although among the rural poor, meats are consumed less than in other areas, and mostly eaten in the form of bushmeat. Nyama is the Luganda language word for \"meat\".\n\n## Main dishes\nMain dishes are usually centred on a sauce or stew of simsim, groundnuts, beans or meat. The starch traditionally comes from posho  (maize meal) or matooke (steamed and mashed green banana) in the central or kalo (an ugali dish made from millet) in the north, east and west. Posho or millet is cooked as a porridge for breakfast.\nFor main meals, white maize flour is added to the saucepan and stirred into the posho until the consistency is firm. It is then turned out onto a serving plate and cut into individual slices (or served onto individual plates in the kitchen). Cassava, yam, and African sweet potato are also eaten; the more affluent include white (often called \"Irish\" or \"Western\"/mazungu) potato and rice in their diets. Soybeans were promoted as a healthy food staple in the 1970s and this is also occasionally eaten for breakfast, although mostly used as feed for animals. Chapati, similar to Asian flatbreads, are also part of Ugandan cuisine.\n\n## Fruits and vegetables\nVarious leafy greens are grown in Uganda. These may be boiled in the stews, or served as side dishes in fancier homes. Amaranth (dodo), nakati, and borr are examples of regional greens. Fruits such as mangoes, bananas and pineapples are plentiful and commonly consumed, whether cooked in foods or eaten alone as snacks or as a dessert.\n\n## Traditional food names\nSome traditional and historic Ugandan foods include:\n\nPosho or kawunga—called ugali in Kenya, it is usually made from maize but also other starches; regional names include kwon. Ugandan expatriates make posho from cornmeal, masa harina or grits. Kwon is a type of ugali made from millet (called kalo in western Uganda), but in other regions like eastern Uganda they include cassava flour.\nGroundnuts (peanuts)—groundnuts are a vital staple and groundnut sauce is extremely common in Ugandan cuisine. Groundnuts are eaten plain or mixed with smoked fish, smoked meat or mushrooms, and can also be mixed with greens such as borr.\nSim-sim (sesame)—a staple particularly in the north, roasted sesame paste is mixed into a stew of beans or greens and served as a side dish, though sesame paste may also be served as a condiment; a candy is made from roasted sesame seeds with sugar or honey.\nMatooke—(green banana, not plantain) boiled or steamed (mashed) cooked in or served with a sauce of peanuts, beans, fresh fish or meat\nLuwombo—a traditional dish from Buganda, in which a stew of chicken, beef, mushrooms or fish is steamed in banana leaves\nMalewa—a traditional dish from eastern Uganda (Bugisu), made from bamboo shoots\nKikomando—a chapati that is cut into pieces and served with fried beans\n\n## Snacks\nRoasted groundnut (peanuts)—served in a spill of paper\nSamusa (samousa, sumbusa, samosa)—Indian samosas are highly assimilated into the local cuisine, as are chapati and curry\nMugaati n'amaggi (bread and eggs)—Originally an Arab dish, it consists of wheat dough spread into a thin pancake, filled with minced meat and raw egg, and then folded into a neat parcel, which is fried on a skillet or hotplate.\nNsenene—a seasonal delicacy of a type of locust\nNswaa—served similarly to nsenene, but made of white ants\nRolex—a chapati filled with eggs, onions, cabbage or kale, and tomatoes; minced meat is sometimes added\n\n## Desserts\nFresh fruits—a common dessert\nSimsim—made with sugar and sesame seeds\nMandazi—doughnut, usually spiced with cardamon\nKabalagala—banana pancakes, usually made from very ripe ndizi\n\n## Additional Ugandan foods\n\n\n## Beverages\nTea (chai) and coffee (kawa) are popular beverages and important cash crops. These can be served English-style or spiced (chai masala). Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Fanta have all made inroads in the Ugandan market and soft drinks have become very popular. Both traditional and Western beers are probably the most widely available alcoholic beverages across Uganda.\nPombe and lubisi are generic words for locally made fermented beer, usually from banana or millet. Fermented banana wine is also prepared and consumed. Tonto is a traditional fermented drink made from bananas. Obushera beverages are types of traditional drinks made from fermented cereals.\nWaragi is the generic term for distilled spirits and these also vary, see for example Uganda Waragi, a brand name for clear or yellow gin.\n\n## See also\nLugbara cuisine\nTanzanian cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n## Further reading\nOtiso, Kefa M.

Uruguayan cuisine is a fusion of cuisines from several European countries, especially of Mediterranean foods from Spain, Italy, Portugal and France. Other influences on the cuisine resulted from immigration from countries such as Germany and Scotland. Although Uruguay has considerable native flora and fauna, with the exception of yerba mate, native plants and animals largely do not figure into Uruguayan cuisine.\nThe base of the country's diet is meat and animal products: primarily beef but also chicken, lamb, pig and sometimes fish. The preferred cooking methods for meats and vegetables are still boiling and roasting, although modernization has popularized frying (see milanesas and chivitos). Meanwhile, wheat and fruit are generally served fried (torta frita and pasteles), comfited (rapadura and ticholos de banana), and sometimes baked (rosca de chicharrones), a new modern style. Bushmeat comes from mulitas and carpinchos. Regional fruits like butia and pitanga are commonly used for flavoring caña, along with quinotos and nísperos.\nSpanish influences are abundant: desserts like churros (cylinders of pastry, usually fried, sometimes filled with dulce de leche), flan, ensaimadas (Catalan sweet bread), and alfajores were all brought from Spain. There are also various kinds of stews known as guisos or estofados, arroces (rice dishes such as paella), and fabada (Asturian bean stew). All of the guisos and traditional pucheros (stews) are also of Spanish origin. Portuguese and Brazilian influence was also added during Portuguese colonization. Feijoada was incorporated into the rest of the guisos.\nUruguayan preparations of fish, such as dried salt cod (bacalao), calamari, and octopus, originate from the Basque and Galician regions, and also Portugal. Due to its strong Italian tradition, all of the famous Italian pasta dishes are present in Uruguay including ravioli, lasagne, tortellini, fettuccine, and the traditional gnocchi. Although the pasta can be served with many sauces, there is one special sauce that was created by Uruguayans. Caruso sauce is a pasta sauce made from double cream, meat, onions, ham and mushrooms. It is very popular with sorrentinos and agnolotti.\nAdditionally, there is Germanic influence in Uruguayan cuisine as well, particularly in sweet dishes. The pastries known as bizcochos are Germanic in origin: croissants, known as medialunas, are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and lard-based. Also German in origin are the Berlinese known as bolas de fraile (\"friar's balls\"), and the rolls called piononos. The Biscochos were re-christened with local names given the difficult German phonology, and usually Uruguayanized by the addition of a dulce de leche filling. Even dishes like chucrut (sauerkraut) have also made it into mainstream Uruguayan dishes.\nPolenta comes from Northern Italy and is very common throughout Uruguay. Unlike Italy, this cornmeal is eaten as a main dish, with tuco (meat sauce) and melted cheese and or ham.\n\n## History\nThe current roots of Uruguayan cuisine can be traced back to a subsistence economy adopted by gauchos, and sustained on subsistence agriculture implanted by the Spanish and Criollos at the start of European colonization. The native peoples did not stay in one place, and Uruguay was used as a remote port, with few incursions for treasure hunting. The only permanent establishment at the time was constituted by Franciscan friars and was located in a territory now belonging to Brazil called Misiones, because their mission there was to Christianize the native peoples. The tradition of mate started during this time, with the monks brewing a beverage with the leaves of yerba mate that the Guarani people used to chew.\nCattle was later introduced by Hernando Arias de Saavedra. The first group of immigrants came from poor families from Buenos Aires and the Canary Islands, along with their empanadas and cocidos. Everything was sold from pulperias that were both stores and saloons. The asado tradition came with gauchos that lived in the country, descendants of those first families that having no land nor home, made cattle raiding their way of life.\nFood was rudimentary and based on Spanish tradition until immigration at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century when the first families came mostly from Italy and Spain. Immigration increased following World War I and World War II, when people from all over Europe and the Middle East came to Uruguay, including people from Germany, Russia, Italy, and Armenia. Such immigration enriched the importation of dishes, as there is now pasta, Russian salad and innumerable types of pastries from France and Germany, resulting in chajá and alfajores.\n\n## Appetizers, entrees and snacks\nIn Uruguayan cuisine, there is a significant list of preparations and dishes that are included in this category, the most typical or autochthonous is the picada, probably descending from the Spanish tapas, and as for everyday food there are also matambre relleno and lengua a la vinagreta.\n\n### Aperitif\nCommon spirits produced in Uruguay include grappa and caña; grappa is considered an excellent apéritif, and caña is considered a liqueur. Liquor made with caña has good digestive qualities and is mainly consumed as a drink and not as an aperitif. Apéritifs such as martini, vermouth, whisky, medio y medio (half and half) and also uvita, sangria and wine are popular.\nMedio y medio is a special blend of dry wine and sparkling wine, or sparkling wine and caña (rum). Uvita is a fortified wine with caña that resembles marsala wine.\n\n### Entrees\n\n\n## Side dishes\nFood is mostly eaten with bread, and sometimes rice, salad or chips. Along with asado, accompaniments are chorizo, morcilla, offal, and also stuffed peppers, and papas al plomo (roasted potatoes).\n\n## Sauces\nThe most notable sauces in Uruguayan cuisine are chimichurri, salsa criolla and salsa Caruso.\n\n### Picantina\nPicantina is a spicy sauce commonly added to frankfurters (panchos), hungaras, choripanes and hamburgers. It is common to find in fast food dispensers in the street and is locally called 'carritos'. It resembles hot mustard or mayonnaise.\n\n### Mojo\nSharing the same name as the Spanish mojo, it is a simple sauce made with garlic, oil, parsley, oregano, paprika, water and salt, and is added to asado during the cooking process and optionally on the dish. Mojo differs from chimichurri in that it has water besides vinegar and less paprika.\n\n### Chimichurri\nChimichurri is between a vinaigrette and a pesto variant, made with parsley, chopped garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, paprika, oil, vinegar, and salt. Along with salsa criolla it is preferred for asado.\n\n### Salsa criolla\nMade with finely chopped tomatoes and onions, oil and salt, salsa criolla is used for garment of asado, choripán and sometimes panchos.\n\n### Salsa golf\n\n\n### Mostaza La pasiva\nLa Pasiva is a famous chain of restaurants in Uruguay, dedicated to fast food or minutas, as known in the region.  Their specialties are panchos and hungaras and they are renowned for their chivito. Moustard La pasiva is a white-colored hot mustard served along with panchos. It is made with beer, starch, mustard grains, pepper, salt and vinegar. Though it has never been sold commercially, small quantities are sometimes given as a gift for clients.\nMostaza La pasiva is also used among other mustards as a sauce for puchero meat.\n\n### Salsa Caruso, estofado and tuco\nAll three are necessary pasta sauces among other foreign pasta sauces. Salsa Caruso was made in honor of the opera singer Enrico Caruso and became a popular sauce (especially for its main dish 'cappelettis a la Caruso'); estofado is a stewed version of ragu made from steaks and sometimes eaten alone; tuco, when it is with chopped meat, resembles a bolognese sauce.\n\n## Barbecue and salads\n\n\n### Salads\nUruguayan cuisine has adopted and created many salads, the most typical being ensalada criolla.\n\n## Asado\nBarbecue asado can be said to make the meal or is the meal itself. The meal and cut of meat are also called asado or tira de asado.\nIn most Uruguayan homes, it is common to find a special grill on the patio called an asador.  It is a structure made of iron and brick. Most asadores are at least two meters by one meter, have a chimney, a place for firewood and a large grill for the meat. Embers produced by the firewood are placed under the grill.\nIn many towns and cities, street vendors sell asado. These small barbecue grills are called medio tanque (half barrel), because they are made with on adaptation of a split steel drum. Asado cooked this way is sold often on the street as a snack or light lunch.\n\nIn the larger cities, such as Montevideo, markets commonly have one or more grill stations where customers can order and eat asado directly at the bar, which may be served with offal, sausages, tapenades, and tapas. It is usually served with lager beer for lunch.\nThe person making the meal is also called asador.\nAsado is often preceded by apéritives such as vermouth, uvita, and medio y medio, an entree called picada and some chorizos, morcillas, and some offal.\n\n### Ingredients\nIngredients of a complete Uruguayan asado include chorizo, morcilla, pulpon, entraña, tira de asado, cow gizzards, chinchulines, chotos, and kidneys. Poultry may also be included.\nSometimes, especially on festive days, pork, fish, and lamb are consumed as a substitute for beef, constituting a variant.\n\n### Preparation\nA typical asado takes from one hour to two hours to be prepared, and even more, if a different kind of meat is going to be barbecued (for example a whole pig takes at least four hours to be ready).\nThe asador starts the fire in the burner and, once the fire is started, the meat is salted and condiments added; condiments may include oregano, garlic, paprika, parsley and mojo.  The first embers are put in place, the meat put on the grill and embers added to as they fall from the burner. The meat is slowly cooked and smoked on the asador and mojo is added periodically for flavor.\nThe meat is served with bread and salads, condiments such as mojo, chimichurri and Uruguayan salsa criolla and beverages such as wine, clerico and sangria.\n\n### Variants - Asado con cuero\nAsado con cuero (barbecue with its leather), is a favorite variant rurally and is also appreciated in the capital.  It requires a more complex technique than that employed for making asado in that the animal is barbecued whole and even with its hide, though the bones are discarded.  This practice was initiated by the pampa people who, if they needed to move on in a hurry, could easily take with them the rolled-up meat.\n\n## Beverages\nTypical Uruguayan beverages are mate, caña, uvita, grappamiel and medio y medio (half and half). Although Uruguay has considerable native flora and fauna, with the exception of yerba mate, native plants and animals largely do not figure into  Uruguayan cuisine.  Wine is also a popular drink. Other spirits consumed in Uruguay are caña, grappa, lemon-infused grappa, and grappamiel (a grappa honey liquour).\n\n### Grappa\nGrappa was brought by Italian immigrants as they kept coming at the immediation of SXIX. Grappamiel and grapa con limon were made in the Country from this Italian influence.\n\n### Uvita\nA taste for wine was acquired from Mediterranean influence, also sangria and clerico. Uvita (little grape) is a fortified wine resembling marsala wine.\n\n### Medio y medio\nLiterally meaning half and half, medio y medio is a drink blend of caña and sparkling wine or dry wine and sparkling wine. It is made and sold under the trademark Roldos.\n\n### Mate\nMate is consumed at any time and on any occasion, solely with tortas fritas or biscochos. It is so important that the act of drinking mate is a ritual of friendship between those involved. Even carrying a thermos of hot water facilitates this practice and on hot summer days it is still said to be refreshing.\nThe dried leaves and twigs of the yerba mate plant (Ilex paraguariensis) are placed in a small cup. Hot water is then poured into a gourd just below the boiling point, to avoid burning the herb and spoiling the flavor. The drink is sipped through a metal or reed straw, known as a bombilla.\n\nUruguay is the first global consumer of mate, with a consumption of 6.8 kilograms of yerba mate per capita a year, surpassing Argentina by 1.2 kilograms per capita at year.\nYerba mate also is consumed as mate cocido. When it is prepared with milk it is called mate de leche and milk is added, it is called mate con leche.\n\n### Grapa con limon\nGrappa is sold under various trademarks but the most significant one is San Remo.  It is distilled and bottled by ANCAP and there was also an attempt to produce the original Italian grappa by some local cellars. When macerated with lemon it is called grapa con limon.\n\n### Caña\nCaña is an amber-coloured drink distilled similar to aguardiente made from sugar cane mill. Its caramel colour is due to aging in barrels. It is distilled and bottled under the brand name De los 33.\n\n### Grappamiel\nGrappamiel or Grapamiel is a mixed alcoholic beverage popular in Uruguay containing grappa, spirits obtained from various grains plus honey and water. In agreements with the European Union, the drink is a food protected by geographical indications. The definition is provided by CONSULTA Nº 4.548 of the Uruguay Government.  Grappamiel is very popular in rural areas, and is often consumed in the cold autumn and winter mornings to warm up the body.\n\n## Stews and puchero\nSpecially suitable for cold days, Uruguayan guisos or stews are highly revitalizing, especially for their puchero, followed by buseca, guiso carrero, guiso de fideos (noodle stew), estofado and feijoada.\nSpanish culinary influence is marked in Uruguayan stews, Also there are Italian and Portuguese-Brazilian influences, this last coming from the Luso-Brazilian invasion of Uruguay.\n\n### Puchero\nFrom Spanish tradition puchero, Uruguayan puchero differs not much from others of the region, it is like a rough soup where dry ingredients are separated from the broth after cooked to make two separate preparations, a new soup that is first consumed, and later the soup all the other succulent ingredients are consumed with bread.\nA typical puchero may contain all type of cuts with bones, skirt steak, ossobucco, bacon, cabbage, sweet corn, rape, onions, celery, carrot, sweet potato, squash, and potatoes.\nAll these ingredients cut in big pieces are cooked and served, with the broth are made different soups containing small noodles, rice or any cereal of predilection.\nIt is usual that each commensal makes their puree on his dish with all the cooked vegetables that have been served, aligning it with oil if desired, and also to take off the caracu (bone marrow) from the ossobucco bone and spread it over pieced bread.\nMustards of the brand Savora and also La pasiva are used for garnishing puchero meat.\n\n### Ensopado\nA dish for summer days and popular on rural areas, consisted on broth, noodles and gross slices of meat, chorizo sausage. and tocino bacon boiled together.\nIts vegetable composition is reduced due is pretended to not ferment on hot days, so it only has few onions and squash.\nIts name comes from verb ensopar (to moist, to soup), participle ensopado (being souped).\n\n### Guiso carrero\nSometimes it is hard to say what is Argentinian and what is Uruguayan (history links people strongly). Guiso carrero is part of not only cuisine, but Uruguayan folklore.

Typical Uruguayan pizzas include pizza rellena (stuffed pizza), pizza por metro (pizza by the meter), and pizza a la parrilla (grilled pizza). While Uruguayan pizza derives from Neapolitan cuisine, the Uruguayan fugaza (fugazza) comes from the focaccia xeneise (Genoan), but in any case its preparation is different from its Italian counterpart, and the addition of cheese to make the dish (fugaza con queso or fugazzeta) started in Argentina or Uruguay.\n\nSliced pizza is often served along with fainá, made with chickpea flour and baked like pizza. For example, it is common for pasta to be eaten with white bread (\"French bread\"), which is unusual in Italy. This can be explained by the low cost of bread, and that Uruguayan pasta tends to come together with a large amount of tuco sauce (Italian: suco - juice), and accompanied by estofado (stew). Less commonly, pastas are eaten with a sauce of pesto, a green sauce made with basil, or salsa blanca (Béchamel sauce). During the 20th century, people in pizzerias in Montevideo commonly ordered a \"combo\" of moscato, which is a large glass of a sweet wine called (muscat), plus two stacked pieces (the lower one being pizza and the upper one fainá). Despite both pizza and faina being Italian in origin, they are never served together in Italy.\n\n### Pizza\nUruguayan style pizza, usually rectangular in shape, has a thicker crust and this rising higher than the usual Neapolitan pizza. It is commonly sliced squared, resembling pizza al taglio or Sicilian pizza. Pizzas with an even thicker crust are referred to as \"pizza de cumpleaños\" (birthday party pizzas) as it is common to serve to guests on such occasions.\nPizza can come with a lot of ingredients, but most common are pizza (without cheese nor topings) and pizza-muzzarella.\n\n### Fainá\nFainás are often served in pizza bars and restaurants throughout the country.\nIt consists of a thin, round chickpea flour baked crepe paste than can be ordered as \"fainá de orilla\" (fainá from the border) when is the thinnest part of the border. that is desired or \"fainá del medio\" (faina from the middle) when it is referred to the taller middle part of a fainá.\nUnlike the common use in Italy that fainá is peppered on the plate by the crust, Uruguayan use implies peppering on the plate with white chopped pepper by the other side.\nWhen fainá is served upside a pizza it is called \"pizza a caballo\" that may be translated as horse-riding pizza.\n\n### Figazza\nA figazza is a pizza bread not containing tomato sauce, topped with onions and often also muzzarella. It is probably descended from the Genoese focaccia (where it is known as fügàssa), and it is also consumed in Argentina under the name fugazzeta.\nTypical ingredients of a figazza are onions, peppers, and olives.\n\n### Lahmajun\nLahmajun (locally known as \"lehmeyún\") was brought by Armenian immigrants. Nowadays it is very popular, found at several small restaurants and pizzerias.\n\n### Fideos con tuco\nTuco is an Uruguayan tomato sauce made with chopped meat, tomato sauce, onions, oreganon and garlic, fideos meaning noodles.\nTuco can be served with any pasta, fresh or dry, but most common are tallarines con tuco (spaghetti with tuco), ñoquis con tuco (gnocchi), moñitas con tuco (farfalle), raviolis con tuco (ravioli), and canelones con tuco (cannelloni).\nCanelones con tuco are covered with bechamel and later covered with tuco.\n\n### Fideos con estofado\nEstofado and tuco are interchangeable for any of the mentioned noodles though estofado can serve also as a dish by itself when served alone or with potatoes.\nEstofado is made by cooking meat pieces in tomato sauce by long coctions.\n\n### Ñoquis\nGnocchi, or ñoquis of the 29th is a tradition of having gnocchi every 29, brought in by the immigration from Veneto, the tradition of Saint Pantaleo, who had many miracles attributed to him, is said to honor him.\nFamilies and friends gather on the 29th to eat gnocchi, the tradition is that everyone at the table puts money under the plate for good fortune.\n\n### Capeletis a la Caruso\nCaruso sauce was invented by chef Raymundo Monti and takes its name from the famous tenor Enrico Caruso. It is a warm sauce that is made of cream, sliced onions, ham, cheese, nuts, and mushrooms and is served with cappelletti.\n\n### Breads\nPan de chicharrones\nLiterally meaning rind bread, also rosca de chicharrones, is a leavened bread made of cow lard and added with small rinds made of cow fat, commonly found on local bakeries among with sweet variations without rinds such as rosca de membrillo, (quince (cheese-filled) bread) and rosca de dulce de leche (dulce de leche (filled) bread).\n\nFlauta\nPan flauta (flute bread) is an elongated bread that is a variant of baguette.\n\nTortuga\nPan tortuga it is a small round-shaped bread with a soft crust, thus its name tortuga (Spanish for turtle).\n\nFelipe\nFelipe is a hard-crusted small bread.\n\nPorteño\nPorteño is called after the eponym of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires and is similar to Felipe but with a smaller crumb.\n\nMarsellés\nMarsellés is named after the city of Marseille and resembles a pair of twin Vienna bread with harder crust and covered with maize flour.\n\nPan de sándwich\nPan de sándwich is a soft crumb mold bread specially made for making sandwiches.\n\n## Sandwiches\nThere is a wide variety of sandwiches in Uruguay which are locally classified into two types called refuerzo (reinforcement) and sándwich (sandwich) respectively.\nSandwiches in Rio de la Plata are particular and different of those from other parts of the world because of the bread with which are made that is pan de sándwich, this type of sandwiches are simply called sándwiches and are commonly sold on local bakeries.\nAlso note that the Spanish distinction between refuerzo and sándwich which is also present in Mexico with torta and sándwich, which differentiates common bread sandwich from others similar to the British train sandwich, is not so pronounced on the Argentinian dialect where difference is simply made by adding de miga (crumby) to the latter.\nNotable types of refuerzos are chivito, choripán and milanesa al pan.\n\n### Chivito\nChivito meaning literally small goat is a popular type of sandwich originated in Uruguay, its name comes from an unaccomplished desire from a client that literally wanted a beef of small goat or a chivito, being that goat is not consumed in Uruguay client had to be satisfied anyway with this now popular dish.. Hence a thin slice of filet mignon substituted the beef of small goat, nowadays it is uncertain if bacon, mozzarella, ham, onion, Hard-cooked eggs, tomato slices, mayonnaise, olives and bread really complement the goat flavour.\nVariants from chivito are, as milanesa en dos panes, chivito en dos panes, chivito canadiense (added with Canadian bacon), chivito canadiense al plato and chivito al plato (platted chivito).\nA complete chivito is served with french fries and when is dished is also sided with ensalada rusa and ensalada criolla.\n\n### Choripán\nChoripán, Spanish portmanteau for sausage (chorizo) and bread (pan) also called chorizo al pan (sausage on bread), is a sandwich made with barbecued chorizo (that is sliced in half to fit), mayonnaise, ketchup, tomato, lettuce, onions, etc.\n\n### Sándwich Olímpico\nSándwich Olímpico (Olympic sandwich) is a very popular sandwich in Uruguay made with three slices of pan de sándwich filled with ham, cheese, olives tomato and lettuce.\n\n### Sándwich caliente\nSándwich caliente (hot sandwich) or \"tostado\" (toasted) as it is called in Argentina is a variant of the croqué monsieur made with two slices of pan de sánguche filled ham and cheese and toasted.\n\n### Jesuitas\nJesuitas are made with two layers of puff pastry filled with ham and cheese and covered with meringue icing.

Along with several historical, natural and religious tourist destinations, including Char Dham, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Panch Kedar, Himalayas, and Sapta Badri. Uttarakhand is also home to two World Heritage sites.\n\n## Etymology\nUttarakhand's name is derived from the Sanskrit words uttara (उत्तर) meaning 'north', and khaṇḍa (खण्ड) meaning 'section' or 'part', altogether simply meaning 'Northern Part'.\nThe name finds mention in early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of \"Kedarkhand\" (present day Garhwal) and \"Manaskhand\" (present day Kumaon). Uttarakhand was also the ancient Puranic term for the central stretch of the Indian Himalayas.\n\n## History\nArchaeological evidence supports the existence of humans in the region since prehistoric times. Though initially, it was believed that due to harsh climate and mountainous terrain, this was a barren and uninhabited land. But after various excavations and the study of ancient literature, it is now established that the history of Uttarakhand goes back to Stone Age. Evidences of Stone Age settlements have been found in various parts of Kumaon and Garhwal, particularly notable are the rock shelters at Lakhudyar, Almora.\n\nThe region formed a part of the Uttarakuru Kingdom during the Vedic age of Ancient India. Among the first major dynasties of Kumaon were the Kunindas in the second century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism. Ashokan edicts at Kalsi show the early presence of Buddhism in this region.\nAncient rock paintings, rock shelters, paleolithic age stone tools (hundreds of thousands of years old), and megaliths provide evidence that the mountains of the region have been inhabited since prehistoric times. There are also archaeological remains that show the existence of early Vedic (c. 1500 BCE) practices in the area. The Pauravas, Khasas, Kiratas, Nandas, Mauryas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas, Karkotas, Palas, Gurjara-Pratiharas, Katyuris, Raikas, Chands, Parmars or Panwars, Mallas, Shahs and the British have ruled Uttarakhand in turns.\nAmong the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the second century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism and traded salt with Western Tibet. It is evident from the Ashokan edict at Kalsi in Western Garhwal that Buddhism made inroads in this region. Shamanic Hindu practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy also persisted here. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal Vedic Hindu rule due to the travels of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains.\n\nBetween the 4th and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty dominated lands of varying extents from the Katyur valley (modern-day Baijnath) in Kumaon. The historically significant temples at Jageshwar are believed to have been built by the Katyuris and later remodelled by the Chands. Other peoples of the Tibeto-Burman group known as Kirata are thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and are believed to be ancestors of the modern day Bhotiya, Raji, Jad, and Banrawat people. During the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Katyuri rulers of Kumaon also known as 'Kurmanchal Kingdom'. After the fall of Katyuris, the region was divided into the Kumaon Kingdom and the Garhwal Kingdom.\n\nBy the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom in the west and the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed. Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmars who, along with many other Rajputs and Brahmins, also arrived from the plains. In 1791, the expanding Gorkha Empire of Nepal overran Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. It was annexed to the Kingdom of Nepal by Amar Singh Thapa. In 1803, the Garhwal Kingdom also fell to the Gurkhas. After the Anglo-Nepalese War, this region was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli and the erstwhile Kumaon Kingdom along with the eastern region of Garhwal Kingdom was merged with the Ceded and Conquered Provinces. In 1816, the Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a smaller region in Tehri as a princely state.\n\nIn the southern part of Uttarakhand in Haridwar district (earlier part of Saharanpur till 1988) the dominance and kingship (rajya) was exercises by some local Hindu rulers, the area was under control of Parmar (Panwar) chief in eastern Saharanpur including Haridwar in kingship of Raja Sabha Chandra of Jabarhera (Jhabrera). The Panwar clan held more than 500 villages there in upper Doab, and that situation was confirmed in 1759 in a grant by a Rohilla governor of 505 villages and 31 hamlets to one Manohar Singh (written in some records as Raja Nahar Singh son of Sabha Chandra). In 1792 Ram Dayal and his son Sawai Singh were ruling the area but due to some family reasons Ramdayal left Jhabrera and went to Landhaura village, now some villages were under the control of Raja Ramdayal Singh at Landhaura, and some under his son Sawai Singh at Jhabrera. Hence, there were two branches of Jhabrera State (riyasat) main branch at Jhabrera and the second one at Landhaura, both father and son were ruling simultaneously without any conflicts till the death of Raja Sawai Singh of Jabarhera in 1803. After the death of Sawai Singh total control of powers transferred to Ram Dayal Singh at Landhaura, but some villages were given to descendants of Sawai Singh and her widow to collect revenue.\nBy 1803 the Landhaura villages numbered 794 under Raja Ram Dayal Singh. Raja Ram Dayal Singh died on 29 March 1813. These holdings, at least those in the original grant made by the Rohilla governor, were initially recognised by the British in land settlements concluded with Ram Dayal and his heirs. As the years passed, more and more settlements appear to have been made with the village communities, however, and by 1850 little remained of the once vast estate of the Landhaura Khübars. There are many temples and Ghats on Ganga built by Rajas of Landhaura estate, therefore they also famous as ' Haridwari Rajas' in folk history and literature. Famous Dakshamahadev Temple at Kankhal was built by Queen DhanKaur of Landhaura in 1810 A.D.\n\nNext the Timli estate Founded in Dehradun mid-15th century by Chaudhari Ram Singh, a member of the Chokar Hindu family, the estate remained under the rule of this dynasty until its eventual annexation. In 1548, two chieftains, Pohda Singh and Lal Karan, from the Titron region in Saharanpur district, crossed the Sivalik hills, conquered the entire Dehradun area, and established the Timli estate. They also founded a town named Timli Chaudhari Bhagwan Singh have power of magistrate.\nRaja Ranjit Singh of Samthar state, born in 1943, was married at a young age to a princess from the Chokar family, which ruled in Timli estate in Dehradun.\n\nAfter India attained independence from the British, the Garhwal Kingdom was merged into the state of Uttar Pradesh, where Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions. Until 1998, Uttarakhand was the name most commonly used to refer to the region, as various political groups, including the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (Uttarakhand Revolutionary Party), began agitating for separate statehood under its banner. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions. These bonds formed the basis of the new political identity of Uttarakhand, which gained significant momentum in 1994, when demand for separate statehood achieved almost unanimous acceptance among both the local populace and national political parties.\nThe most notable incident during this period was the Rampur Tiraha firing case on the night of 1 October 1994, which led to a public uproar. On 24 September 1998, the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Bill, which began the process of forming a new state. Two years later the Parliament of India passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 and thus, on 9 November 2000, Uttarakhand became the 27th state of the Republic of India.\nUttarakhand is also well known for the mass agitation of the 1970s that led to the formation of the Chipko environmental movement and other social movements. Though primarily a livelihood movement rather than a forest conservation movement, it went on to become a rallying point for many future environmentalists, environmental protests, and movements the world over and created a precedent for non-violent protest. It stirred up the existing civil society in India, which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalised people. So much so that, a quarter of a century later, India Today mentioned the people behind the \"forest satyagraha\" of the Chipko movement as among \"100 people who shaped India\". One of Chipko's most salient features was the mass participation of female villagers. It was largely female activists that played pivotal role in the movement. Gaura Devi was the leading activist who started this movement, other participants were Chandi Prasad Bhatt, Sunderlal Bahuguna, and Ghanshyam Raturi, the popular Chipko poet.\n\n## Geography\nUttarakhand has a total area of 53,483 km2 (20,650 sq mi), of which 86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by forest. Most of the northern part of the state is covered by high Himalayan peaks and glaciers. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the expanding development of Indian roads, railways, and other physical infrastructure was giving rise to concerns over indiscriminate logging, particularly in the Himalaya. Two of the most important rivers in Hinduism originate in the glaciers of Uttarakhand, the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri. They are fed by myriad lakes, glacial melts, and streams. These two along with Badrinath and Kedarnath form the Chota Char Dham, a holy pilgrimage for the Hindus.\nUttarakhand lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range, and the climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation, from glaciers at the highest elevations to subtropical forests at the lower elevations. The highest elevations are covered by ice and bare rock. Below them, between 3,000 and 5,000 metres (9,800 and 16,400 ft) are the western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. The temperate western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests grow just below the tree line. At 3,000 to 2,600 metres (9,800 to 8,500 ft) elevation they transition to the temperate western Himalayan broadleaf forests, which lie in a belt from 2,600 to 1,500 metres (8,500 to 4,900 ft) elevation. Below 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) elevation lie the Himalayan subtropical pine forests. The Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests and the drier Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands cover the lowlands along the Uttar Pradesh border in a belt locally known as Bhabar. These lowland forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture, but a few pockets remain.\n\n### Climate\nUttarakhand has a temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The climatic conditions experienced in the state vary subtropical in the southern part to alpine in the upper reaches of the Himalayan mountain in the northern parts. The winter season from December to February, is extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between  5 °C (41 °F) to 20 °C (68 °F). In higher altitudes and mountainous regions, temperatures often drop below freezing point. Cold winds blow across Uttarakhand, especially in the higher altitudes and mountainous regions. These winds bring cold temperatures and often carry moisture, contributing to the heavy snowfall in places like the Himalayan ranges and hill stations.\nDuring Pre-monsoon or hot weather season from March to May, temperature starts to rise and steadily rises till it reaches its peak in May to the middle of June, when the mean maximum temperature in southern parts and valleys of the state is at about 34 °C (93 °F) C to 38 °C (100 °F), But in recent days the maximum temperature has increased up to 40 °C (104 °F). and mean minimum temperature is at about 20 °C (68 °F) to 24 °C (75 °F) C. June to September constitutes the southwest monsoon season and the period of October and November is of post monsoon season. The state receives rainfall mainly due monsoon depressions originating in the Bay of Bengal during the southwest monsoon season. The total annual rainfall for the state as a whole is 133 cm and total annual number of rainy days are about 63 cm. Although, rainfall in the state varies from place to place due to its rugged topography. Precipitation is not heavy and occurs in the form of rain and snow. Winds are generally light of the order of 1 to 4 kmph in the valleys and 5 to 10 kmph at elevations of 2 km increasing further with higher altitudes.\n\n### Flora and fauna\nUttarakhand has a diversity of flora and fauna. It has a recorded forest area of 34,666 km2 (13,385 sq mi), which constitutes 65% of the total area of the state. The vegetation of the state majorly comprises alpine trees and tropical rainforests. The state is home to rare species of plants and animals, many of which are protected by sanctuaries and reserves.  National parks in Uttarakhand include the Jim Corbett National Park (the oldest national park of India) in Nainital and Pauri Garhwal District, and Valley of Flowers National Park & Nanda Devi National Park in Chamoli District, which together are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A number of plant species in the valley are internationally threatened, including several that have not been recorded from elsewhere in Uttarakhand. Rajaji National Park in Haridwar, Dehradun and Pauri Garhwal District and Govind Pashu Vihar National Park & Gangotri National Park in Uttarkashi District are some other protected areas in the state.\nBengal tigers and leopards are found in areas that are abundant in hills but may also venture into the lowland jungles. Smaller felines include the jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Other mammals include four kinds of deer (barking, sambar, hog and chital), sloth, Brown and Himalayan black bears, Indian grey mongooses, otters, yellow-throated martens, bharal, Indian pangolins, and langur and rhesus monkeys. In the summer, elephants can be seen in herds of several hundred. Marsh crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) and other reptiles are also found in the region. Local crocodiles were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs and subsequently re-released into the Ramganga river. Several freshwater terrapins and turtles like the Indian sawback turtle (Kachuga tecta), brahminy river turtle (Hardella thurjii), and Ganges softshell turtle (Trionyx gangeticus) are found in the rivers. Butterflies and birds of the region include red helen (Papilio helenus), the great eggfly (Hypolimnos bolina), common tiger (Danaus genutia), pale wanderer (Pareronia avatar), jungle babbler, tawny-bellied babbler, great slaty woodpecker, red-breasted parakeet, orange-breasted green pigeon and chestnut-winged cuckoo. In 2011, a rare migratory bird, the bean goose, was also seen in the Jim Corbett National Park. A critically endangered bird, last seen in 1876 is the Himalayan quail endemic to the western Himalayas of the state.\nEvergreen oaks, rhododendrons, and conifers predominate in the hills. Prunus cerasoides (pahiyya), sal (Shorea robusta), silk cotton tree (Bombax ciliata), Dalbergia sissoo, Mallotus philippensis, Acacia catechu, Bauhinia racemosa, and Bauhinia variegata (camel's foot tree) are some other trees of the region. Albizia chinensis, the sweet sticky flowers of which are favoured by sloth bears, are also part of the region's flora.\nA decade long study by Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala concluded that the Valley of Flowers is endowed with 520 species of higher plants (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes), of these 498 are flowering plants. The park has many species of medicinal plants including Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Picrorhiza kurroa, Aconitum violaceum, Polygonatum multiflorum, Fritillaria roylei, and Podophyllum hexandrum.\nIn the summer season of 2016, a large portion of forests in Uttarakhand caught fires and rubbled to ashes during Uttarakhand forest fires incident, which resulted in the damage of forest resources worth billions of rupees and death of 7 people with hundreds of wild animals died during fires. During the 2021 Uttarakhand forest fires, there was widespread damage to the forested areas in Tehri district.\nA number of native plants are deemed to be of medicinal value. The government-run Herbal Research and Development Institute carries out research and helps conserve medicinal herbs that are found in abundance in the region. Local traditional healers still use herbs, in accordance with classical Ayurvedic texts, for diseases that are usually cured by modern medicine.\n\n## Demographics\nThe native people of Uttarakhand are generally called Uttarakhandi and sometimes specifically either Garhwali or Kumaoni depending on their place of origin in either the Garhwal or Kumaon region. According to the 2011 Census of India, Uttarakhand has a population of 10,086,292 comprising 5,137,773 males and 4,948,519 females, with 69.77% of the population living in rural areas. The state is the 20th most populous state of the country having 0.83% of the population on 1.63% of the land. The population density of the state is 189 people per square kilometre having a 2001–2011 decadal growth rate of 18.81%. The gender ratio is 963 females per 1000 males. The crude birth rate in the state is 18.6 with the total fertility rate being 2.3. The state has an infant mortality rate of 43, a maternal mortality rate of 188 and a crude death rate of 6.6.\n\n### Social groups\nUttarakhand has a multiethnic population spread across two geocultural regions: Garhwal, and Kumaon, including members of the native Garhwali and Kumaoni communities as well as migrant groups, dominated by the Rajput-Brahmin hegemony. Rajputs (of various clans) constitute around 35% of the state's population, followed by Brahmins at 20% to 25%, According to a 2007 study by Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Uttarakhand has the highest percentage of Brahmins of any state in India, with approximately 20% of the population. Uttarakhand is among the few Indian states where the historic Upper Caste forms a major share of the population.\nOf the rest 18.3% of the population is classified as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) Gurjars majorly. 18.76% of the population belongs to the Scheduled Castes (an official term for the lower castes in the traditional caste system in India). Scheduled Tribes such as the Jaunsaris, Bhotiyas, Tharus, Buksas, Rajis, Jads, and Banrawats constitute 2.89% of the population. Several non-scheduled tribal groups such as Shaukas and Gurjars are also found here. Van Gurjars (found in Shivalik hills) and Bhotiya are nomadic tribes while Jaunsaris are completely settled tribe.\n\n### Languages\nThe official language of Uttarakhand is Hindi, which according to the 2011 census is spoken natively by 43% of the population, and is also used throughout the state as a lingua franca.\nThe major regional languages of Uttarakhand are Garhwali, which according to the 2011 census is spoken by 23% of the population, mostly in the western half of the state, Kumaoni, spoken in the eastern half and native to 20%, and Jaunsari, whose speakers are concentrated in Dehradun district in the southwest and make up 1.3% of the state's population. These three languages are closely related, with Garhwali and Kumaoni in particular making up the Central Pahari language subgroup. The languages have been part of various scattered conservation efforts due to their active decline beginning in the later quarter of the 20th century. The decline is hypothesized to be the result of heavy state-sponsored promotion of Hindi as the official language.\nAll the languages enumerated so far belong to the Indo-Aryan family. Apart from a few other minority Indo-Aryan languages, like Buksa Tharu and Rana Tharu (of Udham Singh Nagar district in the south-east), Mahasu Pahari (found in Uttarkashi in the north-west), and Doteli, Uttarakhand is also home to a number of indigenous Sino-Tibetan languages, most of which are spoken in the north of the state. These include Jad (spoken in Uttarkashi district in the north-west), Rongpo (of Chamoli district), and several languages of Pithoragarh district in the north-east: Byangsi, Chaudangsi, Darmiya, Raji and Rawat. Another indigenous Sino-Tibetan language, Rangas, became extinct by the middle of the 20th century. Additionally, two non-indigenous Sino-Tibetan languages are also represented: Kulung (otherwise native to Nepal) and Tibetan.\nThe Indian classical language Sanskrit has been declared a second official language, by the BJP government for its allegedly historic association with the region.\nThere are also sizeable populations of speakers of some of India's other major languages: Urdu (4.2%) and Punjabi (2.6%), both mostly found in the southern districts, Bengali (1.5%) and Bhojpuri (0.95%), both mainly present in Udham Singh Nagar district in the south-east, and Nepali (1.1%, found throughout the state, but most notably in Dehradun and Uttarkashi).\n\n### Religion\nMore than four-fifths of Uttarakhand's residents are Hindus. Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, and Jains make up the remaining population, with the Muslims being the largest minority. Hill regions are almost entirely Hindu, while the plains regions have a significant minority of Muslims and Sikhs.\n\n## Administrative divisions\nUttarakhand is divided into 13 districts under two divisions viz. Kumaon and Garhwal. Each division is administered by a divisional commissioner. Four new districts named Didihat, Kotdwar, Ranikhet, and Yamunotri were declared by then Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Ramesh Pokhriyal, on 15 August 2011 but yet to be officially formed.\n\nEach district is administered by a district magistrate.

Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, lychees, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for lychees, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills. The state also holds the GI tag for Tejpatta (Cinnamomum tamala) or Indian bay leaf, which is known to add flavour to dishes and also possesses several medicinal properties.\n\nOther key industries include tourism and hydropower, and there is prospective development in IT, ITES, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and automobile industries.

Piran Kaliyar Sharif near Roorkee is a pilgrimage site to Muslims, Gurudwara Darbar Sahib, in Dehradun, Gurudwara Hemkund Sahib in Chamoli district, Gurudwara Nanakmatta Sahib in Nanakmatta and Gurudwara Reetha Sahib in Champawat district are pilgrimage centres for Sikhs. Tibetan Buddhism has also made its presence with the reconstruction of Mindrolling Monastery and its Buddha Stupa, described as the world's highest at Clement Town, Dehradun.\nAuli and Munsiari are well-known skiing resorts in the state.\nThe state has 12 national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, which cover 13.8% of the total area of the state. They are located at different altitudes varying from 800 to 5400 metres. The oldest national park on the Indian sub-continent, Jim Corbett National Park, is a major tourist attraction.\n\nVasudhara Falls, near Badrinath, is a waterfall with a height of 122 metres (400 ft) set in a backdrop of snow-clad mountains. The state has always been a destination for mountaineering, hiking, and rock climbing in India. A recent development in adventure tourism in the region has been whitewater rafting in Rishikesh. Due to its proximity to the Himalaya ranges, the place is full of hills and mountains and is suitable for trekking, climbing, skiing, camping, rock climbing, and paragliding. Roopkund is a trekking site, known for the mysterious skeletons found in a lake, which was featured by National Geographic Channel in a documentary. The trek to Roopkund passes through the meadows of Bugyal.\nNew Tehri city has Tehri Dam, with a height of 260.5 metres (855 ft) is the tallest dam in India. It is currently ranked No 10 on the List of Tallest Dams in the world. Tehri Lake with a surface area of 52 km2 (20 sq mi), is the biggest lake in the state of Uttarakhand. It has good options for Adventure Sports and various water sports like Boating, Banana Boat, Bandwagon Boat, Jet Ski, Water Skiing, Para-sailing, Kayaking.\n\n## Education\nThe educational system prevailing in the state's schools specifies an initial 10-year course of study, which is divided into three stages: lower primary, upper primary, and secondary school—known as 4+3+3, which signifies the number of years for each stage. After the first 10 years of schooling, students typically enroll in Higher Secondary Schooling in one of the three major streams—liberal arts, commerce, or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional undergraduate (UG) degree-college programmes. Schools in the state are either managed by the government or by private trusts. The majority of public schools are affiliated with the Uttarakhand Board of School Education (UBSE) use Hindi as a medium of instruction. Private schools in Uttarakhand—which use English as the language of instruction—are affiliated to one of three administering bodies, CBSE, CISCE, or ICSE.\nUttarakhand has more than 20 universities, including one central university, twelve state universities, three deemed universities, one IIT in Roorkee, one IIM in Kashipur and an AIIMS in Rishikesh. Inaugurated by Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1960, G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, provides research and training in agriculture and engineering. Located in Bharsar and Ranichauri, Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali Uttarakhand University of Horticulture and Forestry, is a state agricultural university and has two campuses, one is in Bharsar town of Pauri Garhwal district and other is in Ranichauri town of Tehri Garhwal district. Kumaun University; located in Nainital, is one of the oldest universities in the region.\nUttarakhand is home to some of premier institutes of India that hold the status of national importance due to their significant contributions to education, research, and national development. Founded in 1906, Forest Research Institute (FRI) is the oldest institutions of its kind. Its campus hosts the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), the staff college that trains officers selected for the Indian Forest Service (IFS). Located in Dehradun, The Doon School has been consistently ranked as the best all-boys residential school in India. Established in 1959, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNA), Mussoorie, trains civil servants for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). The Indian Military Academy (IMA), is officer training academy for the Indian Army. The academy trains officer cadets for the Permanent Commission into the Army.\n\n## Sports\nDue to its mountainous terrain and rivers, Uttarakhand attract tourists and adventure seekers for adventure sports, such as paragliding, sky diving, rafting and bungee jumping. Uttarakhand is home to some of the highest peaks in India, including Nanda Devi and Tirsuli, popular for mountaineering expeditions and climbing activities. Traditional sports Mallakhamb (pole gymnastics), Gatka (a form of martial arts) and Gulli Danda (similar to cricket) are preserved, are preserved but have limited exposure. More recently, golf has also become popular with Ranikhet being a favorite destination.\nThe Cricket Association of Uttarakhand is the governing body for cricket activities.

    "text": "# Uzbek cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Uzbekistan, also known as Uzbekistani cuisine, encompasses all traditional and modern cuisines of Uzbekistan. It shares the culinary traditions of peoples across Central Asia. Grain farming is widespread in Uzbekistan, making breads and noodles an important part of the cuisine, which has been described as \"noodle-rich\".\n\n## Description\nBread (nan or non) is  baked in a tandur, which is frequently a pot rather than the deep pit or oven of India and Afghanistan. Many varieties of rice are eaten. Potatoes were introduced by the Soviets, and some elder Uzbeks still refuse to eat them.\nThe most popular meat is mutton. Beef is common, and goat is eaten only rarely. Horse meat is used as well; there are sausages made of horse meat, as is the case with many other Turkic peoples. Karakul sheep provide meat but also fat, particularly the fat from the tail end, called qurdiuq.\nUzbekistan's signature dish is palov (plov or osh or palov, \"pilaf\"), a main course consisting of  rice, chunks of meat, grated carrots and onions. It is cooked in a kazan (or deghi) over an open fire. Chickpeas, raisins, barberries, or fruit may be added for variation.\nAlthough often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the housewife, palov is made on special occasions by the oshpaz, or the osh master chef, who cooks the dish over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings. Nahor oshi, or \"morning plov\", is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of a wedding celebration.\n\nOther national dishes include shurpa (shurva or shorva), a soup made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually mutton) and fresh vegetables; norin and lagman, noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course; manti (also called qasqoni), chuchvara, and somsa, stuffed pockets of dough served as an appetizer or a main course (ranging from \"wonderfully flaky and rich\" to \"heavy, stodgy\"); dimlama (a meat and vegetable stew) and various kebabs, usually served as a main course.\nGreen tea is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day; teahouses (chaikhanas) are of cultural importance. Black tea is preferred in Tashkent. Both are taken without milk or sugar. Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality, automatically offered green or black to every guest. Ayran, a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in the summer.\n\nThe use of alcohol is less widespread than in the West. Uzbekistan has 14 wineries, the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in Samarkand (est. 1927). The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local grape varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally Cabernet dessert wine in Russian). Uzbek wines have received international awards and are exported to Russia and other countries in Central Asia.\nA festive meal ends with fruit or a compote of fresh or dried fruit, followed by nuts and halvah with green tea.\n\n## Dishes and foods\n\n\n### Plov\nPlov (also known as palov or osh) is considered to be the national dish of Uzbekistan, with numerous variations across the country. Its tradition and culture are recognized by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. According to UNESCO, large-scale communal plov that are cooked in oversized kazan cauldrons, are typically prepared by men, while the women tend to only cook plov at home for their families. Specialists that prepare this dish are called \"oshpaz\", and their skills are passed down from masters to apprentices, over generations. There is a tradition where elders start to eat first, before others follow.\nThe basis is meat, usually mutton, with vegetables (carrots and onions), fried in qurdiuq (fat from the fat-tailed sheep). The mixture of onion and thinly cut carrot is called zirvak, and it is compared to European soffrito. Often garbanzos and raisins are added, and instead of mutton all kinds of other basic ingredients can be used, including stuffed grape leaves or poultry.\nThe meat is either boiled or fried with the zirvak. The rice is cooked by being soaked and then placed on top of the other ingredients, so it steams—in contrast to other popular ways of making pilaf, where rice is fried, and the other ingredients added, and then the entire dish being cooked in water. \n\nOshi toki – stuffed grape leaves, similar to dolma, usually served as a cold appetizer.\n\n### Breads\nTraditional Uzbek bread, called generically noni or patyr, is baked in the form of circular flat loaves (lepyoshka in Russian) with a thin decorated depression at the center and a thicker rim all around. Nons are brought to the table with the decorated side up, then torn into irregular chunks which are stacked on the bread plate. Every region has different varieties of non, most prominent are:\n\nObi non is the staple bread of Uzbek cuisine. Obi nons are mentioned in one of the oldest written works, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Obi nons are baked in clay ovens called tandir.\nSamarkand non. In different areas of Uzbekistan, obi non is baked in different ways. In Samarkand, small thick obi nons, the shirma nons are the most popular.\nBukhara obi non sprinkled with sesame or nigella, making a delicate aroma.\nWedding patir (flaky obi non) from Andijon and Qashqadaryo. According to ancient traditions, this aromatic bread prepared with cream and butter was served during matchmaking meetings.\nTashkent lochira, plate-formed obi non, baked from short pastry (milk, butter, and sugar). Jirish non is specially prepared bread from flour mixed with wheat. Nomadic tribes did not make tandirs because of their way of living, but cooked bread on butter in kazans (cauldrons), preparing the dough on a milk base.\n\n### Bukharan Jewish cuisine\nThe cooking of Bukharan Jews forms a distinct cuisine within Uzbekistan, subject to the restrictions of Jewish dietary laws. The most typical Bukharan Jewish dish is oshi sabo (also osh savo or osovoh), a \"meal in a pot\" slowly cooked overnight and eaten hot for Shabbat lunch. Oshi sabo is made with meat, rice, vegetables, and fruit added for a unique sweet and sour taste.  By virtue of its culinary function (a hot Shabbat meal in Jewish homes) and ingredients (rice, meat, vegetables cooked together overnight), oshi sabo is a Bukharan version of cholent or hamin.\nIn addition to oshi sabo, authentic Bukharian Jewish dishes include:\n\nOsh palov – a Bukharian Jewish version of palov for weekdays, includes both beef and chicken.\nBakhsh – \"green palov\", rice with meat or chicken and green herbs (coriander, parsley, dill), exists in two varieties; bakhshi khaltagi cooked Jewish-style in a small bag immersed in a pot with boiling water or soup and bakhshi degi cooked like regular palov in a cauldron; bakhshi khaltagi is precooked and therefore can be served on Shabbat.\nKhalta savo – food cooked in a bag (usually rice and meat, possibly with the addition of dried fruit).\nYakhni – a dish consisting of two kinds of boiled meat (beef and chicken), brought whole to the table and sliced before serving with a little broth and a garnish of boiled vegetables; a main course for Friday night dinner.\nKov roghan – fried pieces of chicken with fried potatoes piled on top.\nSerkaniz (sirkoniz) – garlic rice dish; another variation of palov.\nOshi piyozi – stuffed onion.\nShulah – a Bukharian-style risotto.\nBoyjon – eggplant puree mixed only with salt and garlic, the traditional starter for the Friday-night meal in Bukharan Jewish homes.\nSlotah Bukhori – a salad made with tomato, cucumber, green onion, cilantro, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Some also put in lettuce and chili pepper.\nNoni toki – a crispy flat bread that is baked on the back of a wok. This method creates a bowl-shaped bread.\nFried fish with garlic sauce (for Friday night dinner): \"Every Bukharian Sabbath ... is greeted with a dish of fried fish covered with a pounded sauce of garlic and cilantro\". In the Bukharan dialect, the dish is called mai birion or in full mai birion ovi sir, where mai birion is fried fish and ovi sir is garlic sauce (literally \"garlic water\"). Bread is sometimes fried and then dipped in the remaining garlic water and is called noni-sir.\n\n## Beverages\nBeverages in Uzbek cuisine reflect the nation's Central Asian nomadic roots and its historical role along the Silk Road, offering a diverse array of traditional drinks. Tea holds a central place, with kok choy (green tea) being the most popular, typically served unsweetened in small ceramic piyola bowls to pair with dishes such as plov or shashlik. Black tea, or qora choy, is also widely consumed, sometimes enhanced with herbs like mint or thyme. Dairy-based options include ayran, a cold, salted yogurt drink that complements the cuisine's rich, spiced flavors, and common fermented drinks like qatiq and kumis (fermented mare’s milk), tied to pastoral traditions. Sharbat, a sweet, non-alcoholic fruit drink made by boiling dried fruits such as apricots, raisins, or apples, highlights Uzbekistan’s abundant fruit harvests. Another distinctive offering is chalop, a chilled mixture of yogurt, dill, cilantro, and vegetables, functioning as both a beverage and a light dish. For festive occasions, shirchoy, a salty milk tea prepared with butter, underscores the region’s steppe heritage.\n\n## Gallery\n\n\n## See also\nList of Uzbek dishes\nSoviet cuisine\n\n## References\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "# Vindaloo\n\nVindaloo is a curry dish known globally in its British form as a staple of curry houses and Indian restaurants, specifically a fiery, spicy dish that can be made with a choice of meats.

Fat Les's 1998 song \"Vindaloo\", which became a sort of football anthem, celebrates such lad culture behaviour. Potatoes are sometimes added through confusion with Hindi aloo.\n\n## Portuguese Goan dish\nThe Portuguese founded their State of India in 1501; Goa became its capital in 1530.  \nA standard element of Goan cuisine derived from the Portuguese carne de vinha d'alhos (\"meat in garlic wine\"), vindalho or vindaloo is a dish of pork marinated in vinegar and garlic. This was adapted by the local Goan cooks with the substitution of palm vinegar for the wine, and the addition of spices. \nAccording to the chef Raghavan Iyer, cooks in Goa were free to use pork, a meat avoided by Hindus and Muslims in India, because they had been converted to Christianity by the Portuguese. The historian of food Lizzie Collingham writes that formerly high-caste Goans made a point of eating pork and beef as they had acquired outcaste status by becoming Christians, and accordingly had to emphasize their closeness to the Portuguese, such as by eating vindalho. Collingham writes that the Goans did not have vinegar, so the Portuguese there used sour tamarind, or made vinegar from coconut palm toddy. In addition, she states that the Portuguese liked their food extremely spicy, with up to 20 chili peppers in a recipe. Christopher Columbus found chili pepper when he sailed to Central America in 1492, and it was soon planted in the Iberian Peninsula. By 1528 at the latest, the Portuguese had introduced it to the Malabar Coast, and several varieties of it were being grown in Goa; their use quickly spread across India. \nVindaloo has, Collingham writes, become the most famous element of Goan cuisine. Traditional Goan vindalho does not include potatoes; some Indian versions add them due to the confusion with the Hindi आलू aloo, \"potato\".\n\n## Fiery British dish\n\n\n### Origins\nThe British highly prized Goan cooks. As a result, Anglo-Indian cuisine in the 19th century took on vindaloo or \"Portuguese curry\". Its method of preparation was then used for other kinds of meat, including especially duck. W. H. Dawe's 1888 cookery book, The Wife's Help to Indian Cookery, gave a recipe for \"Vindaloo or Bindaloo—A Portuguese Kárhí\", suggesting beef, pork, or duck as the meat. London's Veeraswamy restaurant, opened in 1926, served the same sort of British Raj food, including duck vindaloo in its early years. Vindaloo became widespread in Britain with the creation of more Indian restaurants in the 1970s.\nThe food writer Glyn Hughes suggests that at that time, British Muslim chefs intentionally omitted the pork and the wine vinegar called for by the Portuguese recipe, substituting chicken or beef as the meat and lemon juice for the vinegar. Iyer on the other hand gives a recipe for \"British Curry House Vindaloo\" which uses both vinegar and pork, along with both mild spices and \"potent-hot\" chili. Felicity Cloake however writes that the dish is sweet and sour rather than hot, and that the \"tangy gravy works best with rich meats like duck or pork\".\nA variant theory, from the food writer Pat Chapman, is that vindaloo served in British restaurants is not based on the Portuguese dish, but simply a version of the standard medium spicy (Madras) restaurant curry with the addition of vinegar, potatoes and plenty of chili peppers.\n\n### Restaurant curry\nThe name \"vindaloo\" was effectively redefined in postwar British usage to mean simply an extremely hot curry, contrasting with a mild korma. Vindaloo has indeed featured in \"challenge\" competitions to see who can eat such a hot curry. In Britain, vindaloo became associated with white working-class culture, as well as social rituals and tests of masculinity.\nCollingham writes that the habit of British Indian restaurants of the period of staying open late, after pub closing time, allowed working class Britons to discover \"that a good hot vindaloo went down particularly well on a stomach full of beer\", and people became accustomed to have a curry after an evening's drinking. This was accompanied in lad culture by, in Collingham's words, the \"lager-loutish tradition of rolling, uproariously drunk, into an Indian restaurant and proving one's machismo by ordering the hottest vindaloo or phaal possible\".\nThe 1998 Fat Les song \"Vindaloo\" is named for the curry. The actor and songwriter Keith Allen stated that the dish was appropriate for the sort of song that a \"right-wing lout\" would like. Whatever the reasons for its composition, it became something of a England football fan anthem during the 1998 World Cup.\n\n### International dish\nFrom Britain, vindaloo became international. In 2010, the \"Vindaloo against Violence\" campaign invited Australians to share a curry in a \"stand against racial intolerance\", which had included attacks on Indian students there. The dish was introduced to Hong Kong when it was a British colony. In 2020 the food and beverage manager of the region's Aberdeen Boat Club described vindaloo as one of its most commonly ordered dishes. Pork vindaloo can according to the Guide Michelin be found in restaurants in Tokyo, Japan. The Swedish Meat organisation (Svenskt Kött) proposes \"Vindaloo – Indian stew with lamb shoulder\" on its website.\nA study of Indian food in America found that restaurants could offer dishes like \"Goan Spiced Maine Crab cake\", which it described as \"a far cry\" from standard pork vindaloo as \"differentiated restaurants [break] new ground\".\n\n## References\n\n\n## Sources\nChapman, Pat (2004).

    "text": "# Yemeni cuisine\n\nYemeni cuisine is distinct from the wider Middle Eastern cuisines with regional variation. Despite being an Arab country, Yemeni cooking traditions have been influenced more by Indian and Indonesian methods as a result of its maritime history.\n\n## Customs\nThe generous offering of food to guests is one of the customs in Yemeni culture, and a guest not accepting the offering is considered an insult. Meals are typically consumed while sitting on the floor or ground. Unlike the tradition in most Arab countries, lunch is the main meal of the day in Yemen, not dinner.\n\n## Food preparation\nIn Yemen, many kitchens have a tandoor (also called tannur), which is a round clay oven.\n\n## Fruits and vegetables\nTomatoes, onions, and potatoes are some of the staple fruits and vegetables in Yemen.\n\n## Meat and dairy\nChicken, goat, and lamb are the staple meats in Yemen. They are eaten more often than beef. Fish is also eaten, especially in the coastal areas.\nCheese, butter, and other dairy products are less common in the Yemeni diet. Buttermilk, however, is enjoyed almost daily in some villages where it is most available. The most commonly used fats are vegetable oil and ghee used in savory dishes, while clarified butter, known as semn (سمن), is the choice of fat used in pastries.\nPork consumption is forbidden to Muslims in Yemen, in accordance with Islamic dietary laws.\nThe city of Taiz is famous for its production of smoked cheese, called \"Taiz cheese\".\n\n## Legumes\nBroad beans are used in Yemeni dishes, such as bean salad. Lentils are also used in dishes such as stews.\n\n## Yemeni dishes\n\n\n### Breakfast dishes\nYemeni people prefer to have warm dishes in the morning. Typically, the meal consists of different types of pastries with a cup of Yemeni coffee or tea.\nA more hearty meal often includes legumes, eggs, or even roasted meat or kebab, which is usually served with a type of bread either aside or as a sandwich. People in Yemen also make a breakfast dish from lamb or beef liver, which is considered a bizarre delicacy to non-Yemenis.\n\nDishes common at breakfast include masoub, fatoot, ful medames, mutabbaq, and shakshouka.\n\n### Lunch dishes\nUnlike most countries, and like Spain and Portugal, lunch is the main meal of the day in Yemen, not dinner. The largest amount of meat, poultry, and grains are consumed at lunch.\n\nDishes common at lunch include:\n\nAseed—a dish made from a cooked wheat-flour lump of dough, sometimes with added butter or honey\nFahsa—a Yemeni stew made from lamb cutlets with lamb broth\n\nFattah—a dish made with pieces of fresh, toasted, grilled, or stale flatbread covered with other ingredients\nHaneeth—a slow-roasted lamb dish cooked in a tannour with a spice rub, usually served on a plate of rice\nHarees—boiled, cracked, or coarsely ground wheat, mixed with meat and seasoned\n\nJachnun—a Adeni Jewish pastry, traditionally served on Shabbat morning\nKabsa—a mixed rice dish, served on a communal platter\nKomroh—made with fava beans, garlic, ghee, black pepper, and salt\nMandi—meat and rice with a special blend of spices, cooked in a pit underground\nSamak mofa—Yemeni-style grilled fish\nShafut— typically made with lahoh (a sourdough flatbread) or shredded bread, hakeen (traditional buttermilk) or yogurt, zhug, and leek\nShawiyah—Yemeni-style rotisserie chicken\nThareed—pieces of bread in a vegetable or meat broth\nSahawiq— a spicy green sauce made of fresh herbs, garlic, chilies, olive oil, lemon, and freshly ground spices.\nZurbiyan— made with lamb, rice, and saffron\n\n## National dish\nAfter Yemen united in 1990, both North and South Yemen had similar cuisines. Despite its regional variations, saltah is considered to be the national dish of Yemen. The most common dishes consumed all over Yemen are made with rice and lamb.\nThere are many ways of preparing lamb in Yemen. In general though, the lamb is usually bone-in large chunks. It can be boiled in its broth and called maraq, it can be roasted in an oven like haneeth, or underground like mandi.\n\n## Yemeni bread varieties\nBreads are an integral part of Yemeni cuisine, most of which are prepared from local grains. Unleavened flatbreads are common. Ṣalūf, a flatbread made from wheat flour, is the most common of all breadstuffs. The dough is allowed to ferment with ḫamīra (yeast), while some would baste the surface of the dough with a prepared batch of unseasoned fenugreek (ḥilba) prior to baking. These were almost always baked at home in an earthenware oven called tannour (تنور) in Arabic, the size of each bread roughly being 2 cm (0.79 in) in thickness with a diameter of 20 cm (7.9 in) to 30 cm (12 in).\nKhobz al tawa, tameez, malooga, kader, kubane, fateer, kudam, khameer, and mulawah are also popular breads eaten in Yemen. Malooj, khubz, and khamir are popular homemade breads. Store-bought pita bread and roti (bread rolls like French bread) are also common. Khaliat Naḥl (Arabic: خلية نحل), or \"honeycomb bread\", is commonly associated with Yemeni cuisine.\n\n### Other Yemeni grain dishes\nʻAṣīṭ—sorghum meal, cornmeal, or green barley meal made into a thick paste after being boiled in water. Before eating, samneh or oil is added. Some eat ʻaṣīṭ during the afternoon meal (usually scooped up with one's fingers), where soup and meat are served, while others place it in the soup, along with ḥilba (\"fenugreek dollop\").\nHarīš—a thick dish (groats), made with cracked wheat, 1⁄4–1⁄3 of the kernel's full size, known collectively as ğašūš. There are some who add samneh (clarified butter), honey or sugar to harīš. In Yemen, harīš is usually eaten on cold winter mornings, and, because of perceived health benefits, is given to women during the first weeks after childbirth, also to the infirm, the weak, and the frail.\nSimilarly, harīs is a thick grain dish (groats), made with broken wheat, rice, lentils or beans, pre-cooked in water with an added fatty portion of meat or bone marrow, along with vegetables—spring onions (scallions), garlic, tomatoes, and more. \nMaṭīṭ—a thin, farinaceous dish (porridge), made with ground wheat or barley (maṭīṭ šiʻīr), drunk with samneh, and occasionally with grated onions or sweet marjoram, which gives it a bitter taste.\nNašūf—a thin, grain-based dish (porridge), made with broken wheat, cooked with either samneh, sugar or honey, and sipped from a bowl, usually for breakfast. Villagers cook našūf with sour milk, adding sahawiq (a hot cayenne-pepper sauce) for added flavoring, a dish known locally as našūf ʻalā zūm.\n\n## Spices\nA spice mixture known as hawaij is employed in many Yemeni dishes. Hawaij includes aniseed, fennel seeds, ginger, and cardamom.\nYemeni cuisine is often prepared hot and spicy with the use of chili peppers, cumin, coriander seeds, turmeric, and other spices. Herbs such as fenugreek, mint, and cilantro are also used. Fenugreek is used as one of the main ingredients in the preparation of a paste or sauce called holba (also spelled hulba). A popular spice used in breads (including kubane and sabayah) is black cumin, which is also known by its Arabic name habasoda (habbat as sowda).\n\n## Desserts and sweets\nBint al-sahn (sabayah) is a sweet honey cake or bread from Yemeni cuisine. It is prepared from a dough with white flour, eggs, and yeast, which is then served dipped in a honey and butter mixture. The tulumba of the city of Taiz are popular as a Ramadan sweet.\nOther common desserts include fresh fruit (mangoes, bananas, grapes, etc.), baklawa, basbousa, kunafah, zalābiya, halwa, rawani, and masoob. Masoob is a banana-based dessert made from over-ripe bananas, ground flatbread, cream, cheese, dates, and honey.\n\n### Honey\nIn Yemen, honey is produced within the country, and is considered a delicacy. Locally produced honey is in high demand, and it is also considered as a status symbol in the country.\n\n## Beverages\nShahi haleeb (milk tea), black tea (with cardamom, clove, or mint), qishr (coffee husks), qahwa (Arabic coffee), karkade (an infusion of dried hibiscus flowers), naqe'e al zabib (cold raisin drink), and diba'a (squash nectar) are examples of popular Yemeni drinks. Mango and guava juices are also popular.\nAlthough coffee and tea are consumed throughout Yemen, coffee is the preferred drink in Sanaa, whereas black tea is the beverage of choice in Aden and Hadhramaut. Tea is consumed along with breakfast, after lunch (occasionally with sweets and pastries), and along with dinner. Popular flavorings include cloves with cardamom and mint. A drink made from coffee husks, called qishr, is also enjoyed.\nAlcoholic beverages are considered improper due to cultural and religious reasons.\n\n## See also\n\nArab cuisine\nHalas (food)\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "# Zanzibari cuisine\n\nZanzibari cuisine reflects several heterogeneous influences, as a consequence of the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic nature of Zanzibar's and Swahili heritage. It is a mixture of various culinary traditions, including Bantu, Arab, Portuguese, Indian, British and even Chinese cuisine.\n\n## Early history\nThe first inhabitants of Zanzibar were Bantus coming from mainland Tanganyika. They consisted of mostly fishers and their diet thus consisted of primarily seafood, such as tuna, mackerel, lobster, squid, octopus and oysters. Other ingredients and recipes brought by Bantus that are found in today's Zanzibari cuisine (some of which became widespread during European colonialism) are common beans, sweet potatoes, manioc chips, yam and plaintain.\nIn the 9th century, Omanis, Yemenis and Persians began colonizing the Swahili Coast, including the Zanzibar Archipelago. They brought new dishes and ingredients, most notably spices, coconut, mango, citrus and rice. One of the most common Zanzibar recipes, pilau (rice, coconuts, nuts and spices), clearly reflects its Arab origin.\n\nBetween the 15th century and the 16th century, the Portuguese quickly conquered most of the coast, including Zanzibar. The main Portuguese influences on Zanzibari cuisine was the introduction of those that would become major types of staple food in Zanzibar, namely manioc, maize and pineapple.\nIn 1651, the Portuguese lost control of Zanzibar to the Omani sultanate. The Omanis brought new spices and intensified the commercial relationships between Zanzibar and India; as a consequence, Indian recipes such as chutney, masala, biryani, curry, fish cakes and samoosa (samosa) made it to Zanzibar. Most recipes of foreign origin were adapted to the ingredients that were available on the island, thus giving birth to a largely original \"fusion\" cuisine.\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, most of the African Great Lakes region was colonised by the Germans and the British. Those did not mix with the local population as much as the Arabs, Persians and Indians had done, and their influence on Zanzibari cuisine is less evident; yet, some very common Zanzibari recipes, such as pepper steak, can be generically defined as having a European origin.\n\n## Post-independence\nAfter independence, Tanzania established a strong relationship with China; Chinese physicians, engineers, and military consultants came to Zanzibar. Although only a small fraction of today's Zanzibari population have Chinese origins, some recipes and ingredients, such as soy sauce, have become commonplace on the island.\n\n## References\n\nZanzibari cuisine Archived 2009-05-21 at the Wayback Machine",

    "summary": "Zarda (Hindi: ज़र्दा zardā, Urdu: زردہ zardā, Bengali: জর্দা jôrdā) is a traditional boiled sweet rice dish, native to the Indian subcontinent, made with saffron, milk and sugar, and flavoured with cardamom, raisins, pistachios or almonds. The name 'zarda' comes from Persian word 'zard' زرد meaning 'yellow', because the food coloring added to the rice gives it a yellow color. Zarda is typically served after a meal.  In the Indian subcontinent, zarda was and still remains a popular dessert on special occasions such as weddings. It is quite similar to sholezard, a traditional Iranian dessert, and zerde, a traditional Turkish dessert .\nOften in Pakistan, instead of yellow food coloring, multiple food colorings are added so the rice grains are of multiple colors. Additionally, khoya, candied fruits (murabba) and nuts are an essential part of zarda made at auspicious occasions. There also is a popular use of raisins, and other dried fruits to dish.\nDating back to Mughal India, zarda had a variation with an addition of small fried sweetmeat pieces called 'mutanjan'.  This dish was a favourite of Emperor Shahjahan and was often made on his request.  This rice dish was made for guests at special banquets.\nThe Mesopotamian people of Iraq also prepare this dish (with the same name), typically made while fasting during Lent—thus prepared without dairy products.",
